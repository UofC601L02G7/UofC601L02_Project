2024-09-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly with them again,False,"  Long story short, they refuse to make things right when they poorly manage their flights, passengers, and communicate for people who have connecting flights. I’ll never fly with them again. They’re going bankrupt for a reason, look at their stock falling over the past 5 years.",-1
2024-09-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Nashville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Don't fly Spirit,True,"   Don't fly Spirit. I paid more for my bag than my seat and they trashed my bag then refused to make it right my luggage was brand new before this flight and now it is seriously damaged but the loopholes in their 7 page contract says they are not responsible for their damage. Flight was terrible, seats are cramped. 5 dollars for a can of coke, and they changed my flights 6 times without my consent in a 3 month period of time.",-1
2024-09-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to LaGuardia,,,,,,1.0,1.0,"never tolerate this again"" ",True,   Horrible experience this morning trying to get on the flight. I lined up and they scanned my ticket then the representative at the counter decided to pull me to the side because my little purse was in my hoodie’s front pocket. He said I was trying to trick them by sneaking sth that was not in my personal item bag. He made me step to the side and said that I can no longer get into that flight. When I demanded to learn about their policy on canceling people’s flight plans on a whim he said he didn’t like my attitude and wants to write me up to never fly with Spirit again. I had to buy a brand new ticket with Delta to fly to New York.  I will never tolerate this again.,-1
2024-09-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"$90 for my personal item"" ",False,"   I traveled with Spirit airline before and never got into this issue before until yesterday. My personal item, my backpack which fits perfectly and the spirit in line display they have at the boarding gate. However, they still charge me $90 for my personal item. And threaten me that I'm going to miss my flight if I don't pay for the bag. So I ended up paying for my personal item that clearly informs in their website regarding their policy for personal item and it fits perfectly on the display they have but for some reason they still charge me. I strongly believe this is not right. Policy, false advertising and most importantly threatening me that I'm going to miss my flight. I had to pay for my bag. I have the picture of my personal item fitting perfectly.",-1
2024-09-03,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Detroit,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,Nothing is simple with them,False," I really wanted to like Spirit. It's a cheap option, and I am grateful for that. The flight attendants are nice, and the pricing is cheap, but the lack of a functioning website and customer service has taken a toll on me. We also get a delayed first flight and miss the connecting flight and have to stay in Florida every single time. The next flight out is always 2 days later. The website hardly works and you have to show up in person to get your boarding pass, which can ultimately make you miss your flight. The customer service people are so rude. They pass the buck every time they get a chance. It is getting really old. The only way to get a hold of anyone is with WhatsApp and most of the time the refer you to the customer service department at the airport. Nothing is simple with them.",-1
2024-08-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Florida to Columbus via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"Horrible customer service"" ",True,"   Horrible customer service. Had a layover in Las Vegas flying from FL to OH…. Doesn’t make sense but whatever. They cancelled flight 2 nights in a row, then to remedy the situation they offered me a direct flight from FL to OH. Problem was we were in Vegas! So after 3 hotel stays we eventually had to rent a car & drive home. All in all was out over $2400. Just got notice that they approved my claim in the amount of $476 Regularly fly but will never fly Spirit airlines again",-1
2024-08-30,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Burbank to San Francisco,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,"extremely disappointing experience"" ",False,"   I had an extremely disappointing experience with Spirit Airlines. The staff were rude and careless, and the airline seems to be more focused on ripping off customers than providing decent service. We were traveling with our two kids, both under 5, each of whom wanted to bring their own luggage. Spirit charged us $150 last min for each child's luggage for $75 just because the wheels were designed to stick out slightly. When I requested seats with a view for the kids, as every child enjoys the experience of looking out the window, they placed us at the very back of the plane where there were no windows at all. To make matters worse, we were kept waiting for an extended period before being allowed to board and be seated. I strongly advise against using Spirit Airlines, especially for parents who are concerned about their children's needs and safety. This experience was far below what we expected, and I cannot recommend this airline to anyone.",-1
2024-08-29,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,“the legroom was horrible”,False, I cannot believe it. Plane was in a huge mess and the legroom was horrible. My legs were squashed. Not to mention about the flight getting delayed by 2 hours. I was late for my meeting cos of that. 10/10 would not recommend!,-1
2024-08-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1.0,5 delay emails in 30 min,False,"  How much money, time, and mental energy are you willing to waste? In all, the company has cost me over $700 in having to book with another company on the spot when they failed. They offer an ""apology"" and a $12 food voucher. 5 delay emails in 30 min. So I found the only other flight via Delta, and I believe that is the exact thing that happened last time too. If money and time are no problem to you, stick with Spirit.",-1
2024-08-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Portland,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,complete incompetence,True,"   Where do I start when every aspect of a flight was beyond negative? The flight was delayed, but ok, that’s understandable especially to someone who is also in aviation. The complete incompetence with seating, especially families with small children. The severe lack of basic customer service skills, which was beyond unacceptable; everyone was undeservedly spoken to like they are the bottom of the barrel of society. The trash was not picked up from the prior flight, resulting in open drink container splashing on bag and feet (there is photo evidence). When pointed out prior to take off, the first flight attendant said “it’s not my problem, someone else will come around.”, the next flight attendant ignored me, and finally, after take off, she snatched it out of my hand with a disgusted look on her face. A mom with a newborn was yelled at when trying to get up to sooth a crying baby, and another was yelled at for getting up to change baby’s diaper that was smelling up the entire plane. These are just the highlights. I understand that it’s a no frills airline, but this is unacceptable and shocking that they are still in business. One star, but we took off and landed, so that’s something.",-1
2024-08-22,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Kansas City,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2.0,isn’t worth the cheap admission,False,"  This airline is trash! The experience isn’t worth the cheap admission. The luggage fees are ridiculous, no snacks or beverages, and no Wi-Fi as you have to pay for everything. No cushion or recline in the seats, constant delays. This is the greyhound bus of the sky. If you can, book with someone else.",-1
2024-08-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Los Angeles,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,2.0,The environment is so chaos,True,"   My round trip both were delayed which is expect. The aircraft is not clean and very unorganized. After landing, we had to wait 30 min to get into the gates. Everyone who needs the connection flight were so upset. The environment is so chaos.",-1
2024-08-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Boston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,"Ended up taking train"" ",True,"   Delay delay, delay. Ended up taking train because flight was delayed so many times for so long. Never will try to fly on spirit again. Heard this about spirit from many people but didn’t listen .. should have! Don’t ever book with Spirit Airlines please!",-1
2024-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,First and last flight with Spirit,False,  Flying with Spirit Airlines is ridiculous. I paid 117.00 for seat selection to arrive at the airport and have my seats taken from me as they overbooked the flight. That is not a me problem that is a Spirit Airlines problem. The point of purchasing 3 seats together is so my family could all be together and then find out we are all separated and my underage daughter is ok to sit with someone else as long as the parents are on the flight. I am sorry but that is totally unacceptable. The people working the counter at MCO need better manners. First and last flight with Spirit and I will continue to tell everyone I know how terrible the service .,-1
2024-08-17,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Florida to Houston,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,5 times my gate changed,False," 5 times my gate changed. As a 70 year old it's a very hard time. Staff was not professional, very rude and bad attitude. Flight canceled and no water or anything provided. 14:53 flight canceled, got flight 20:30 pm. Siting at the airport from 12:30pm till 20:30pm. I never recommend to anybody. Unbelivable rude staff. Ask for water to take my medicine and they refuse it. Worst airline service.",-1
2024-08-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Cancun,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Exorbitant luggage fees,False, This airline is absolutely the worst. From the cardboard seats. No beverage service. Exorbitant luggage fees. Rude staff and pilots. I will tell everyone I know not to use this airline. It’s not even cheap enough to offset any complaints. Horrible.,-1
2024-08-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Horrible customer service,True,"   Horrible customer service. We landed at 2:40 and didn’t get our luggage till 3:40 and it wasn’t until a bunch of people went to the office to find out what’s going and and complain until they sent out the luggage. Horrible airline, horrible experience and not even worth it because by the time you add all the the things they charge for it’s more expensive than the good airlines!",-1
2024-08-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Las Vegas to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,cheap price is not worth it,False," Absolute Worst Customer Service! From the Flight Attendants and Pilot both late to flight (no they weren't on other flights) to the customer service rep at Counter no remorse for the situation at hand. Maybe this something they deal with daily, however when it comes to cancelled flight being alone at midnight in a city that I was not familiar with. Vouchers were given for hotel, food and a Lyft however the only Voucher worked was food. Hotel Green Valley Ranch didn't even except Vouchers this is something that should have been known before we were sent there ended up have to pay for my own room at $230 per night to only hear its not guaranteed i'll get my money back and if I do only up to $150. Not sure why just $150 when Spirt is the one whom sent me to this hotel anyway. No one to talk to at 2am your on your own God forbid I didn't have any money would have been sleeping on lobby floor like the others. Again alone on this flight. I will post everyday advised everyone to go with a different Airline the cheap price is not worth it.",-1
2024-08-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Avoid this airline,True,"   Spirit is currently the only non stop flight from SDF to FLL but in hindsight I'd prefer to pay more and have a connecting flight than deal with this clown show of an airline. They lost my and every other car seat on on the flight and it seems to be a common occurrence. I haven’t been able to speak with a human since reporting the missing luggage 5 days ago. everything about their customer service is automated, but it’s done very poorly. for example, I received an email saying my car seat was found and would be delivered back to my home 4 days ago. I called the 800 # to check on it, and after digging thru the menu was advised to use the chat feature. after filling out some info i waited 5 mins for chat just to be told to call a different # for baggage. i called baggage and was on hold for 20+ mins with periodic automated updates “you are caller 8, estimated wait 12 mins… you are caller 6” etc, all the way to “caller 2, estimated wait 1 min” and then finally - sent to voicemail! the tickets are cheap but after paying for carryon bags, checked bags, drinks (no free sodas or pretzels here!) it’s not nearly as good as it seems. and they constantly try to upsell you with emails and notifications throughout the entire experience (“want to sit together? buy your reserved seats now!”) which is obnoxious. Avoid this airline at all costs.",-1
2024-08-08,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“It is not a a value airline”,False," While I understand that Spirit Airlines operates under the guise of affordable, but at what cost? We are in a recession and I get that; however, it is not a a value airline. They do not understand the meaning of ""quality service"". On August 2, 2024 we were supposed to arrive at BWI at 8pm, but there was a tropical storm. We were re-routed several times, because we could not land. When we were able to land, we sat on the runway for two hours. The children were crying and exhausted; the parents and passengers were also exhausted, frustrated. We were not offered anything to pass the time and there weren't any considerations or exceptions made for the children. Upon leaving, my son dropped his iPhone on the aircraft. I filed two claims - 1415434 and 1415290. I used find my iPhone which showed the BWI location well into 08/06/24. I reached out to the airline several times, tried to contact them on twitter to no avail. The hold time was 3 hours and when I left my number for a representative to call me, they called me two days later. When I contacted the airline on social media that pretended to be receptive and concerned to later block me from uploading the information. The representatives are offshore and the response is always scripted. I will NEVER fly Spirit. It is NOT economical or worth the hassle. They will NOT improve until consumers STOP using their services. We ALL deserve BETTER!",-1
2024-08-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,very unprofessional very inconsistent,False,  Spirit airlines and their staff on the plane and in the airport was very unprofessional very inconsistent. Spirit Airlines delayed our flight home a total of 9-12 times and waited until 3.30 am to say the flight was cancelled. I assume a 12 dollar meal ticket was sufficient enough due to lack of communication on the terms and conditions of the flight. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to fly Spirit Airlines,-1
2024-08-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,extremely dissatisfied with service,True,"   I am extremely dissatisfied with service. My flight was cancelled and rebooked to late the next day, so I was forced to get a hotel and miss a day of work. My efforts to get in touch with a representative to discuss reimbursement have been unsuccessful; I have been on hold for 40 minutes and the chat function is equally impossible to use. I would simply like to speak to a representative about reimbursements which I am owed by law due to this inconvenience, and Spirit has done an incredibly poor job of handling it by making it extremely impossible to get in touch with anyone.",-1
2024-08-05,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Baltimore,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2.0,budget for disrupted travel plans,False,"  I am writing this so that other travelers have the full information about what risks they might take on with Spirit and other lower priced airlines in the US. The tickets are indeed cheaper than other flights, but when the flight is cancelled, as happened on our return trip, the options are few. The flight was first delayed by an hour or more, before we had checked in. Seven hours ahead of that new departure time, the flight delay of three additional hours was announced again (arrival at the airport now being after midnight, necessitating use of rideshare instead of public transport). Then, three hours later, the flight cancellation was announced. The next rebooking options were two days later. We chose to get a refund knowing that booking another transport option at such short notice would in no way be compensated by our refund. Indeed, other airlines had routes that did not work for us for twice the price, and we ended up booking a bus and a train for a total of 10+ hours' travel (compared to 4.5 hours total, including travel to airport and airport security lines for the outbound flight), not including the travel to and from the station - these tickets were also much more than the flight refund, but on a more convenient timeline. Plus, I would be missing work, but I'm lucky enough to manage some tasks on the train as there is free WiFi on Amtrak. So, be prepared to always budget for disrupted travel plans. It's very possible to arrive at the destination when public transport is not available, indeed, many budget routes are at inconvenient times and require pre-planning and additional cost to airport. It's also very possible to incur additional expenses (hotel, alternate tickets) which these budget companies do not compensate.",-1
2024-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Burbank,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“airport agents were clueless”,False, I left SLC airport in 8-3-24 and I was scheduled to connect and depart out of Las Vegas on flight NK264. But they bumped 3 passengers off that oversold flight including my ticket but they left my minors ticket intact somehow. And the ticket agents blamed me saying since I arrived off the SLC flight on my connection which wasn't my fault I was let off gate A8 and I was given only 15 minutes to make from the arrival gate in Vegas to the departure gate A15. So essentially I was told although I am not a pilot that I arrived late. But the connection time to begin with was under 45 minutes and the SLC aircraft arrived 30 minutes late. And then I was booked on a later flight NK249 departing at 5:31 PM. But that didn't happen on time. We didn't depart until 6:46 PM since we didn't have a pilot arriving on time. All passengers had to sit on the plane and wait an hour and 15 minutes. Mind you my checked bag was supposedly sent to Burbank Airport on the flight I was bumped from NK264 because it was oversold. And Spirit told me since I did not pay a seat fee for that flight NK264 and although I had a minor traveling with me and even though I called the airline 3 times before departure to discuss seat assignments and I arrived 2 hours earlier that the takeoff time. I was advised to do that but again it seemed like I would only get help if I paid another $100 for seat assignments and the airline told me although assigned a seat in advance it was given away since I chose not to pay a fee for it. And then arriving at Burbank at 8:15 pm instead of 4:30pm and losing out on time with family that I won't see again for another year. Plus my baggage is missing. Because it was put onto flight NK264 the one I was bummed from. The airport agents were clueless upon my arrival and no one would help me get into the locked baggage claim office. Not even the supervisor whom at Burbank Airport I have been trying to reach since 830 pm yesterday 8-3-24. No phone calls back no I'm sorry for ruining your vacation for you and your minor 5 year old. Who started crying because her toys are in the bag that's still locked in the baggage claim office at the Burbank Airport.,-1
2024-07-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to New Orleans via Detroit,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,treat people like a herd of cattle,True,"  Spirit Airlines allows only one small carry-on bag and a personal item. I had a small carry-on bag, and was carrying a small fabric bag with a few items inside. It wasn't larger than any women's purse. When it was my turn to board, for some reason, the attendant told me I could not carry that with me. He was very truculent, demanding, bossy, even aggressive. Considering I had 3 other people with me, I decided to not delay the trip, and I paid extra for the bag: $79.00. Spirit Airlines do not know how to treat customers as customers, they treat people like a herd of cattle. I suggest you spend a little more and fly a regular airline.",-1
2024-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst service I have ever received,True,"  This is the worst service I have ever received in 50 years flying. 12 hours delay, with no explanation, but instead they knowingly lied to hundreds of passengers who were waiting on their feet for hours and hours. No redress offered. No vouchers for meals. Some Spirit staff on duty admitted that the company knew about these problems from the day before but still only 4 people were on duty to check luggage for almost 1000 passengers. They lied to us (I was travelling with a 10 year old), assuring that the flight would wait for us to board. The truth is the plane was gone before we even made it to security. Apparently they just wanted to clear the check in lobby as much as possible, as television cameras were present to record the repeat of the previous day clients' uproar. Zero information. Total disregard for elderly and children waiting for hours. No redress or support. Outright lying to clients. I had never seen anything like this. I will never fly again with Spirit. The lower prices are offset by the fact that they charge 130 for a single carry on piece of luggage on a domestic roundtrip. They don't even offer free water in the plane, $5 for a small nondescript bottle of water for a child who's been waiting for 11 hours. Plane seats are bare, no recharging of devices. The worst section in the terminals without electrical outlets or sufficient seating.  You end up paying extra for everything.",-1

Spirit’s systems for self check-in and self bagging are frequently down, in both Atlantic City and Orlando. When this happens staff gets over whelmed, rightfully so. They are not ready to accommodate the influx of ppl they need to check in. The self check in systems need to be updated and I need to feel comfortable that they are working before I feel comfortable flying Spirit again.",-1
2024-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,was delayed 8 times,True,  Flight from Detroit to LAX via Las Vegas was delayed 8 times! Their is no one to talk to. Their chatbox does not recognize their own reservation number and does not connect you to an actual agent that can help. It says estimated time is 45 minutes but you are still waiting 2 hours later.,-1
2024-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst experience ever,True,"  Spirit Airlines is the worst experience ever, and we fly a LOT. Flew my son from Phoenix to DFW, but the connecting flight to Orlando, delayed 3 times then cancelled outright. Offered to rebook him 3 days later, not a care for his survival in Dallas airport for those 3 days. Spirit tried to blame weather. Actually they specifically blamed ""weather."" BUT, the only airports experiencing weather are JFK, LGA, ERW, and CLT, and the maximum delay at any of them is 1 hr 19 min. (My daughter worked for SWA up until her baby was born recently). Guess Spirit doesn't count on people knowing the truth. To make them the  worst airline ever though? They refused my autistic son  a simple request for a cup of water.",-1

My family rescheduled our flights From Miami to Chicago to stay on vacation a few more days. Then when we get to the airport to fly out they told us we only changed my reservation, not my wife or sons despite us having a confirmation. Then they charged us a fee for my wife and son ""not showing up for their flights."" They refused to refund any of the original flights and even mine that day because they said I could board. Like I'm supposed to leave my wife and son halfway across the country. The customer service ladies were rude, Asking my wife, why are you crying, you're crazy. She was not making a scene not being loud just trying to figure out what was going on with our flights. Spirit airlines was supposed to investigate, we never heard anything back never got a penny back for all four flights. We've called customer service and every time we're on hold for 45 minutes it hangs up on us. They'll never get our money again. They can just mix up your reservations and never refund your money.",-1

We arrived for our flight 2 hours early to leave almost an hour late due to confusion from employees about what gate our flight would be boarding, there were 3 full flights standing at one gate with no communication and rude staff. We finally board take off the flight was pretty smooth and then the pilot announced for the crew to prepare for landing which they did, after crew was strapped in ready to land the pilot then announced we were going to do a few circles over the water due to a weather issue over the Orlando airport, we flew over the Gulf of Mexico for almost an hour and then the pilot finally announces that we only had 15 more minutes of fuel and we would have to go to a different airport to refuel and then we would would be able to fly to Orlando! Well we landed at the Fort Myers airport and were told to be patient because the airport was not expecting us and we would have to wait to get fuel, this is were it gets worse. They announced we would stay on the plane so we could do a fuel and go!! Yay right, nope not even 5 minutes later they announced sorry there has been a change that we were getting off the plane due to the pilot wouldn’t be able to fly without a crew because the crew were heading overtime and there was no other crew to fly with the pilot. The flight from Fort Myers airport to Orlando airport was only a 30 minute flight, but they opted out that they were not going to fly on it and we had to get off the plane and would figure everything out for us when we got off the plane off the plane on our flight leaving at 7:30 to head to Orlando arrive at 8:01. Our people are waiting for us in Orlando to pick us up. Let them know before we get off the phone, the screen says flight canceled. The spirit airlines said that the flight was canceled. There’s nothing that they could do that. We’d have to figure out a way to get where we needed to go with no help. They said it was issue was not a issue because there was a issue , they abandoned 250 people from that flight at a airport we were not supposed to be at with no help no flights out of the airport no restaurants open in the airport for us to eat drink anything no vouchers no suggestions.",-1

Original departure time 3:30pm, flight was delayed due to “poor weather” when both destinations had no signs of rain or alarming weather conditions. Waited 8 hours with 4 kids to be told unapologetically from the useless Supervisor that the flight was canceled when in fact a flight going to the same destination took off at the very moment.

This is ridiculous. During this time my phone is being used to occupy me therefore my battery is drained majority of the actual flight. And there are no charging outlets. The internet works only half the time and my money has been taken multiple times Without me receiving service. I’m extremely fed up, they have never offered any type of accommodation.  I don’t understand why they rush is on the plane to have us sitting for hours. We should be able to get off if we choose. I’m highly frustrated currently been sitting almost two hours.",-1
2024-06-20,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Antonio,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,"a horrible experience"" ",True,"  Traveled back from Orlando to San Antonio with family of 4 on June 15th, 2024. I sat on an emergency aisle seat and following safety instructions from crew, put my little camera bag containing my camera and accessories including zoom lens, reading glasses underneath the seat in front of me. On landing San Antonio, i forgot to take bag out of aircraft and realized immediately I was out of the aircraft. I approached a Spirit Airline airport staff who told me I cannot get back on plane to collect forgotten item due to protocol and directed me to the spirit website to file a lost report. I did that and even more. I made several calls to Spirit customer care number after and was directed to the same website to file a lost item report. Six days in I have heard no feedbacks from Spirit Airlines and online portal just responds with ""searching"" each time I check for an update on my report. How much more ridiculous can this be? I was incapacitated for a few days without my reading glasses because I certainly thought Spirit would re-unite me with my forgotten items sooner than later, especially since I made the report almost immediately I noticed I left the bag in the aircraft. Had to get an over the counter reading glasses which does not have all the screen protection for my eyes, but whcih atleast gets me by to read. Camera has memories from a family vacation I would never be able to replicate if not found. With timely notice as i provided, it is irresponsible service from a service provider to not follow up, communicate and remediate asap. It's been a horrible experience so far and hopefully Spirit Airlines can make this right and reach out to me and get my belongings returned. Item was left in a specific spot on the aircraft, not in the airport. Except it's not protocol to clean up the cabin before embarking new passengers, there's a lot of question hanging here to be answered.",-1

2024-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Nashville via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the flight ruined my trip,True,"  On June 15, after I checked out of my hotel in Punta Cana, I received an email that my first flight to Fort Lauderdale would be delayed. So instead of the flight being 4pm it changed to 8:30pm and I would arrive at 11pm. I sat in the airport from 2pm waiting for my flight with my family until 8:30pm which was when boarding started. However, my connecting flight did not delay to match my first flight so the second flight departed at 10:30pm. I stayed on the phone with Spirit Airlines customer service for more than an hour trying to figure out a solution to this problem. They told me all the flights were booked and were not able to provide a hotel for me and my family to stay at because it was a weather issue not maintenance which I understand but they did not help at all. They kept changing the gate number and there were no announcements which made not just me but a lot of other passengers confused. After we got to Florida, I received my newly purchased bags in terrible condition which I attached pictures of. I went to the customer service there and I told them everything and she said that they can’t do anything because of the weather and the closest flight available was Monday which was the 17th. When I asked her how much the refund would be if I cancelled it, she told me “give me a second” and I waited. I thought she was looking for another solution but then she said she cancelled it, which is not what I asked for. When I told her that, she was arguing with me and being very rude and said that I was the one who told her to cancel the flight. We asked her to get a manager to reverse the cancellation, the manager didn’t even show up. She did not care to fix our problem and that was a huge issue because some of us had work the next day that couldn’t be missed. After 10 hours in the airport, me, my husband and two kids were tired so we decided to book a room in a hotel nearby. We also booked a different flight leaving the 16th instead but it was a different airline. It cost me $800 for the flight. After a fun trip in Punta Cana, the flight ruined my trip and caused me a lot of frustration and cost me more money than I originally was going to pay.",-1
2024-06-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Atlanta,2.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,ordered wheelchair service,False,"   My mother flew Spirit airlines to the Atlanta airport. I always have to order her a wheelchair because she's almost to her 90th birthday. Her flight landed just before 7pm and Spirit had her sitting at the gate until 8:35 pm to be wheeled to the front door. I spoke to the Gate Agent Supervisor at 7:40 and all he was able to offer me is that he ordered wheelchair service. He didn't say when or why it was taking so long. Just that he ordered it. This is absolutely unacceptable! In my opinion it's not only a horrible experience, but a danger as well, because she is passed due on her medication time. I called Spirit Airline and their response to my issue is that 'wheelchair service has been ordered and they will be there soon.",-1

Since the delay happened, we were not able to reach FLL in time to catch a 10am flight to San Jose Costa Rica. We sat FLL airport for almost 13 hours. When we attempted to board the 11:30pm flight, the Spirit service rep indicated we had been “unbooked” in Dallas; meaning the seats that I had purchased were given to someone else. He indicated we would get a full refund, but he would to seat us somewhere else. The “somewhere else” seats were at the very back of the plane. When I reached out to customer after receiving a refund, I was told they couldn’t do anything about it because I had board the plane. Please, if possible, do not fly with this airline. I implore you!

In addition, the app didnt allow us to purchase a checked in bag 1.5 hrs to flight, just grayed it out. This was more than likely deliberately to collect more $$$.

2024-06-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Orlando,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,"left us stranded in Missouri"" ",True,"  Spirit Airlines left us stranded in Missouri. We kept receiving emails for flight delays once we arrived at the airport. Then the flight was canceled due to inclement weather but all other airlines didn’t cancel and flew to our destination. We tried booking with another airline as soon as we received the cancellation and where told we were 5 minutes too late! Then Spirit rebooked us on a flight leaving 2 days later since there was no available flight for the next day. When we arrived at the airport again we found out the rebooked flight was overbooked. No compensation, no hotel …. absolutely nothing. It took us 3 days to get home! We ended up booking another airline to get us home and had to pay. Had they told us we could have booked right away. Instead we received email confirmation for the rebooked flight. When we got to the airport after waiting 2 days the rebooked flight disappeared from my Spirit account. We never even received an email telling us we couldn’t get on the rebooked flight. How is this airline in business? I am from Germany and have probably done 300 flights in my life but never experienced anything like that. My advise: Contact the Department of Transportation. You can file a complaint online on their website. Don’t bother trying to contact anyone from Spirit. It’s a waste of time. If you do call Spirit ask the representative for their agent ID and write it down. You need it for your complaint since whatever they tell you will not be the truth. Book a different airline right away if your flight is cancelled. Don’t believe them. Oh and I also want to mention when we originally flew to Missouri that flight was delayed for 6 hours. 6 hour delay for a 2 hour flight. I was told and I quote ‘we are working on the engine’. Between hotel for 3 nights, food, washing clothes, new tickets, taxi etc. we lost $1000. So ask yourself if this is worth booking Spirit. It was our first and last time with that airline and we only booked because the departure times would’ve really worked for us. The irony! We had even paid for the big front seats so it wasn’t a cheap ticket.",-1

Agents act like robots. They cancel you over and over. Heck yesterday they cancelled my flight and then told me they couldn’t change my return flight because it was not disrupted. The trip is same day round trip! How can I get back if I never got there? No logic. No compassion for issue. Just the blind leading the blind. Don’t expect any answers on why your plane is delayed. They won’t tell you a thing.,-1

The confusion and lack of communication on how the process works was mind-boggling. We originally booked a flight round trip for two people $403.38 but after all the fees and seat charges we ended up paying more than double at around $1,100+. We were charged for an extra bag and we asked for that fee to be removed. They gave me a card to call when I got back home. We did all that to end up being told that they would not refund the bag amount. I also never paid for the seats to come back, I had thought that I only paid for seats to go to Orlando. Needless to say I never recommend anyone to fly on Spirit Airlines. I just booked a flight with American Airlines and there is absolutely no confusion and we only paid a little over $500.",-1

My wife and I were first off plane with assurance from Captain to be able to board connection flight to Los Angeles. Flight to LAX was still at the gate right next to where we were coming off the plane (Exited A18-LAX flight was GATE A19). We exited with 3 other passengers that were also going to LAX. All five of us were denied boarding the connection flight by the flight attendant who came from the plane 4 times to the counter and was told by us all that we are supposed to be on the outgoing flight. The 5 of us were told by the flight attendant that we would have to rebook the next morning to LAX even though the plane was still at the gate. I called Spirit and was told I had to go on their website for a partial refund and was denied on both. This was completely the airline's fault. My wife and I had to pay $1600 to United Airlines in order to get to LAX in time to get on our international flight to Manila. The worst experience I have ever had while traveling and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.,-1

When we arrived in New York our flight was canceled and they automatically scheduled us for tomorrow. They had no pilot. We had to spend more money to fly American Airline. Spirit knew this when we switched to an earlier flight and will not refund the price difference for American, will not refund the extra 600.00 and will not give any money as we have to wait and spend more money to eat and drink. We will land almost the same time as our original flight. No email from Spirit, text, call. I hope people read this review as they should not be in business.

Upon our arrival to New Orleans (our flight was late, and was a connection flight) a few of us gate checked our strollers. The strollers were lost. That's right they couldn't find them, after 30mins only a few strollers showed up (some guests never got their strollers) my stroller was found but upon receiving it was snapped on both sides at the bottom right and left joints.

We were told take off was 4pm ET but due to being re-routed we needed additional gas before taking off. This is completely unacceptable and I do not understand how the most basic part of flying is not addressed or checked PRIOR to boarding passengers. I want to understand what process could possibly cause a need for additional fuel and why the crew and captain were not prepared prior to allowing people to board. We were told not to leave our seats or open up any overhead bins while we sat in unadjustable seats for over an hour. Absolutely ridiculous and nothing was said to accommodate passenger requests.

2024-05-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,a horrible experience,True," On May 27th I tried to book our seats and check in luggage and when I went to pay, it would not accept my cards and I tried many times, I was able to get a hold of someone late at night and explained to the rep what was happening and she was able to book my seats and luggage information and then went to process my payment and emailed me 2x a link to pay and it did not work either so she processed my information and it went through for her. She said I could go online and book our seats and luggage for coming back on May 30th. On May 29th, I went online and again, the same process with paying online did it did not work, my friend and I tried various cards. I started calling the number they give us for contact at 7:30 a.m. in Las Vegas, NV. I tried consistently for 10+ hours and every time, I was put on hold for more than 30 - 45 minutes and then would hang up because of frustration. Finally at about 4:00 p.m., I opened up the Chat and then also called the number and after about 45+ minutes a guy named Chad answers my call. I explained what was happening about the payment and he tries to do the same thing and when I told him that I wanted the $4 seats for me and my friend and the baggage check in for $44, he told me that those are not available anymore and that he would have to put me in $18 seats each and charge me $79 for baggage because I was booking through him. I told him that he should not penalize me because of their system errors and he should provide better customer care as I work in the hospitality industry and I would never treat my guests that way. I told him to forget it and I hung up. I then went into my chat and spoke with a rep there and she helped me out as I explained to her what happened prior on May 27th and she looked through all my information, got my seats booked for $9 each and then I screenshotted her the error message and the $49 baggage fee and she got it all set up in my cart for me. She tried to process my credit card information and it still did not go through for her either. She was very polite and gave me the number for them to process my credit card info and I called that number and the rep helped me out and payment went through. I get that they may be a cheaper airline but they charge you for every little thing (bottled water $4.95), but when I saw my complete bill, I paid about $120 more than what I would have paid for on another airline. Just because they are cheaper doesn't always mean that you won't be paying for other things or get better customer service. I like knowing that I can call a customer service number on other airlines and not be put on hold for an extended amount of time and they will get their systems online taken care of and fixed to better help their customers. This was my first and last time I will ever fly with Spirit Airlines. It was a horrible experience and I will pay the extra money to book with other airlines.",-1

Are you serious? Will another flight be available if I miss my connecting flight? Nope!

And if you do schedule a trip so you don’t lose your credits if you can’t make that trip in 3 months you lose your credits anyway. My credits expired on May 29th, I was told I had through the 29th to use them so I was getting off work and going to schedule a flight somewhere anywhere cheap and just use my leave days because it was a chunk of money. They told me they expired at 2am on the 29th when I was told I had all of the 29th to use them. Then I saw that they have extended their flight credits so you now have 1 year to use them. The service rep said they literally changed the policy May 20th and they couldn’t help me. I was on the phone for a couple hours plus their messaging board and the last call they hung me up. Extremely disappointed with them. They are living up to their name. Why try caring about your customers if your flights are a little cheaper. So sad",-1

At 630am the pilot again apologizes, says we will be leaving shortly. At 7am we are all told to get off of the plane and go back into the airport. I go back in and try to get help from an agent, but they are angry and being bombarded by everyone. I attempt to speak with a woman who seems very irritated and tells me that right now there’s nothing she can do and that I need to have a seat and wait. After awhile I hear from another passenger that we will be boarding another plane shortly. I check my email and see we will in fact be boarding another plane, but I will arrive 10 minutes after my connecting flight’s doors shut. I land in Ft Lauderdale and see that my flight was automatically rescheduled to 9pm. I sit all day in the airport and as I sit here writing this it is almost midnight and my flight still is not boarding.

I paid $85 a bag and I had 2. 1 carry on that I thought was free. Plus $85 for the checked bag.,-1

We showed up in Las Vegas with nothing but the clothes on our backs. I have been dealing with Cindy in Houston Airport and she's the only one who has been good to us. I have been trying to contact baggage claims main line for over a week now. I couldn't get anyone on the phone and even leave the message with no return call. A few minutes ago I tried again and spoke to a woman. A not very friendly one at that. She informed me that we have thirty days from the date our luggage was lost to Separately enter every single item that was in the bag with the receipt of the item that was in the bag. You have got to be completely insane if you think people keep receipts For everything that ever bought especially their clothes. I am submitting replacement Items and hope that will be accepted. This is an absolute nightmare and the fact that we have to jump through hoops is absolutely insane. This is the final straw with Spirit Airlines and we will never fly with them again.,-1

They cancelled our flight at the last minute, with no warning, which left us stranded 3 hours from home, last flight of the day. We had to be in Boston the next day by 9am. Ended up having to pay over $1500 to book on another airline at the last minute. To make it worse, they wouldn’t cancel our return flight so we could book a round trip on another airline. To make it laughably worse, they charged me $79 for a personal bag that they said was 1” over the length. The gate agents were ridiculous and were yelling at people not to come to the desk, etc. Total nightmare, would never fly them again.",-1

Prior to doing so the customer uses the pre-check-in feature on the SPIRIT APP. Upon doing so the customer received confirmation of bag check and a QR CODE for boarding. Once in the terminal the customer used the kiosk to confirm boarding. After the kiosk the customer approached the check bag window. Once there the customer was asked to provide ID. At that point the customer discovered that the ID was not on his person. The customer had to retrieve ID from parked vehicle. The customer traveling partner remained at the check bag window. note that the attendant had placed tags on the bag prior to discovering the traveler did not have ID. The customer returns to the check bag window 3 minutes after the check bag window closes. The customer and the traveling partner were refused further services. The customer was told of the policies by more than one employee of this airline in an unfriendly manner. Sarcastic remarks were used such as ""You need to wear a watch, so you can get here on time."" The customer is a first time flier. He chose your airline and had a very poor and disappointing experience. As a result, the passengers missed a milestone event of a child graduating from High School today. We are seeking restitution for this experience. No other offers to accommodate were available. There was no suggestion of collaborating with other airlines to get the passengers to their destination.",-1

The rudest people you ever want to meet. The original flight was canceled, next we were booked for a late flight leaving at 10 pm the next day. The flight kept being delayed to almost midnight, tsa wasn’t aware of late flight because they weren’t notified by spirit , tsa closed at 10 pm. Spirit proceeded to check us in and take our bags anyway. Spirit lied to us and said they can’t get our bags off the plane ( that we couldn’t get on) and that they would send them to our house. As of right now my bags are headed back to New Orleans and I’m in a totally different state. These people refused to accommodate us in anyway , refused refunds, and the level of unprofessional is insane. Do Not waste your money!",-1

Allmost all my flights delayed. Terrible Customer Service. They always screw you up and the only thing they’ll do is give you a $50 voucher to fly with them but it’s absolutely worthless! I have a 100 of them that expired because it’s nearly impossible to utilize them. They're crooks and that’s why they don’t want the new airline bill to pass because they take no responsibility or have no accountability for their lack of quality service!,-1

I am stuck in Dallas now and have to return my car rental and have checked out of hotel. They refused to provide hotel accomodations or transportation. I read what was on the website and they still refused. I had to call 3 times and when I asked to speak with supervisor only background talking was present with laughing. I came to Dallas for a funeral. I'm am horrified. I told them I don't have a car or a place to stay, they still refused anything other than refunding the cost for flight, luggage, seat (which isn't enough to get same or next day flight home).

The airline has the most terrible staff among its staff. I was forced to sleep over at the airport for 2days, all my three tickets were messed up, they later re-route me. I boarded spirit NK1594 from Newark to New orleans this morning. Those guys at gate 46B claimed I have to pay $99 because my backpack has wheels that doesn't fit into box. I told him $99 is too much for the backpack. I told them that people before me are carrying bigger bag, and you didn't stop them. They said he will re-book me to another flight if I can't pay, and I agreed. He told me to wait so he can rebook me. The lady later came and said we have agreed to let you go, ""drop your bag here and go inside"" which I did, hoping that she will put my bag inside the plane, but when I reach my destination, I couldn't find my bag. I told spirit staff at New Orleans of my missing bag. She contacted them, and they lied that I trash my bag because I cannot pay claiming the cleaner has pack it. All efforts to find my bag proves abortive as no one is ready to listen to my own side of the story. I later gotten their number in Newark, they quickly hang up on me when they hear my voice and refuse to pick the call again. My backpack is not up to 5lbs. My US passport, driver's license, Samsung phone, car key, all debit and credit cards, Bluetooth, wallet, hospital ID card, and one uniform are inside. I was stranded at the airport for over 8 hours, going back and forth, no single spirit staff could render any useful help. I even ask if I can talk to any supervisor, they were just dribbling me. This is like mystery to me as I've never experience a situation where a staff will trick you to drop your bag and later go ahead to trash it without your consent.",-1

It's bad enough today to be connected to a helpful customer service agent. Spirit went above and beyond to offer me the worst customer service. I can't say it enough. I spent a total of almost 6 hrs to change my flight. They duped me when I paid extra to have a flex ticket which I thought that allows me to change or cancel a flight.

A week before we were scheduled to leave Spirit decided to completely change all of our flights, some left days later our flight now had a layover that was 5 hours. Spirit never contacted us and when I contacted them over this, they said Well there's nothing we can do we over booked the flight. It was complete bs and half our group had to cancel their flights. I will never fly this airline again. The people are rude and don't care if they completely ruin your trip and they offer nothing for all of this.

Finally we are on board, the plane taxied to prepare to take off , guess what? They said the plane is out of power, they then taxied back to the terminal, the flight was canceled, they rebooked the flight next day in the morning. I was just 2lbs extra, they charged me $79 extra for the overnight checked luggage, I asked if they can do a little courtesy because my flight was canceled last night, the employee don’t even care. The worst had ever happened, when I’m ready to fly back from Baltimore to Boston, they first posted another 2 hours delay, then they just straight cancelled the flight. I saw less than 15 passengers, I believe that’s the reason they canceled the flight! It cost me another hotel night and Uber travel to a hotel for rest.",-1

I didn’t get notify of the changes until 3 days before when I got an email to purchase a luggage and I noticed the time had changed. I contacted Spirit and spoke to a supervisor and she simply said there’s nothing she could do for me.

Their website is an absolute nightmare, a digital wasteland where functionality goes to die, leaving customers stranded and infuriated. In-person interactions are equally dreadful, as the incompetent staff at the front desk stumble through their tasks with all the grace of a blindfolded bull in a china shop. And don't even get me started on their so-called customer support – a band of inept liars who gleefully promise resolution while delivering nothing but frustration and disappointment. Flying Spirit is like willingly subjecting yourself to a special circle of hell reserved for those who enjoy torment and misery.",-1

One said to me to come but still had someone in front of her and threatened to send me to the back of the line and then I responded how can I come in front of you if you still have someone there. Got to Miami and noticed my designer suitcase was damaged but I had to leave because I had another flight. When I got home finally I sent a message and their staff said I had to have reported when I collected my bag. There was no staff to report to and I assumed a good airline would have cameras they could use to verify claims. The customer service staff said they keep their price down by not having to do anything about it and he closed the chat.,-1

First they changed my flight from evening 8 pm to morning 7 am with 6 hour lay over in Las Vegas. Original booking had 2 hour layover. Second we came to the airport at 4 am for our 7 am flight. All other airline agents were there at 4 am and helping their customers to check in bags. No body at Spirit counter. No body even at 4:30 am. Nobody even at 5 am. Finally they come at 5:10. We were standing in line for hour and 10 minutes. We did not choose our tickets. We never do. We let airlines automatically assign the seats. We are fine with random seats. But this time this lady tells us that since we did not choose our seats, we may not able to fly in this flight. She says we have 50:50 chance to fly in this plane. I said I already paid for the tickets two months ago, how can I not have a guaranteed seat. She says she is not responsible that I did not choose the seat. She was trying to sell me business class seats. I told her clearly that I am not paying for the seat and I can take a random seat. She still stays I have a 50:50 chance to get into the flight and I may not be guaranteed to fly in the 7 am flight. She is not even offering me a reward to go in the next flight in case it is overbooked. Finally the guy next to her (even he only intervened after 5 mins) says I am guaranteed to fly in the 7 am flight since I paid for the ticket but will be assigned random seat which is fine with me. Totally unprofessional behavior.  Horrible service. By the way, when I checked my bag at Kiosk, the charge for one bag was $89.",-1

Other airlines take their passengers 15 minutes before they board. This was my first and last time using Spirit. They guy didn't let us board and made us pay $99 each for a new boarding pass. We originally were supposed to go to LaGuardia and he said there is not flight till 9pm. I asked him if they fly to JFK he said no we don't fly to JFK. He was lying and being rude and said their is flight for Newark. Don't even bother calling customer service they aren't even helpful not even the supervisor so useless and waste of energy.

2024-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Massachusetts to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,“will never fly with this airline again”,False,"  Coming from a young adult, I had traveled this airline with my parents. My parents had booked this airline to give a try, but did not check the reviews. Researching online, I have found that this airline had been famous for cancellations & delays. This was indeed true. My family had booked two different flights & BOTH were delayed for 2-3 hours. When we got our ticket, it had told us our flight would be delayed till 2pm, but the boarding pass had said 10am. Next to us, I had overheard a family wondering why they were charged for a bag when they had ALREADY paid. As confused as we were, entering the gate was very annoying. The flight had changed twice and could not give us the time we had expected. My family booked the vacation for a short span of time and we have already wasted hours of our day at our destination sitting by the gate. We were bummed out because when I tried to ask the front desk about our departing time, there were already 3 people in line complaining about how this airline had constantly delayed on them. Entering the plane was the worst. The rating I could generously give for the, comfort, entertainment & staff service was a solid 1/10. Even kids could not enjoy the 3 hour flight. I do feel bad for the review, but the delays had struck me with a nerve. I will never fly with this airline again.",-1

The flight was delayed because some vip person had entered Vegas and the airport had not let them fly for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Once we got to Vegas another vip person got there and they had to go in circles in the sky until they could land. They won’t even offer you a glass of water and my carry on stayed behind in the airport because they said they would charge 100$ and I had paid for carry on through 3rd party. I asked them to take it to ticketing so my family member could pick it up. Cheap and delayed plus rude staff.,-1

The system changed her name to mine but kept her date of birth and information in the purchase. When I called to have the name changed they told me I was unable to. They said I need to cancel but it was going to cost me $200 to do so. They then tell me to rebook but the new flight would cost $485 dollars and I couldn’t use the $50 voucher they gave me because it’s in my name. Once it was all said it done and $700 dollars later, she had her flight. Gets to the airport at BWI and was told her flight is delayed 4 hours. And since it’s delayed so long that she won’t make her connecting flight. She would have to reschedule her connection and the only thing available is at 7pm on the 17th of April! They want my 18 year old daughter to stay in an airport for 19 hours. They said we can give you a meal voucher for $7 and hotel voucher. My daughter is 18 and alone which means she cannot check in to a hotel. So once again no solution. Only option I was told was fly out tomorrow night and get to New Orleans after midnight on the 18th. Which means she is missing reasons she is supposed to be here and making the rest of the time here that much more difficult. Not to mention the 2 hour drive to BWI them back home and then again to BWI the next day. Absolutely absurd how airlines are able to mess with people’s lives and money this way with no repercussions or care because they know they can do it.",-1

But each time I’m reminded- don’t do it, it’s a trap. You’re not actually saving money due to their nickel and dime policies. Their employees look unhappy at best and are generally rude.

2024-04-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to LaGuardia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,definitely never recommend Spirit,True,"  This has been the worst experience flying I have had in my past 10 years of flying. I booked 2 one way tickets from Fll to ROC, or so I thought. The first $250 was only a “reservation fee” and that I had to pay the difference of $230 to confirm and actually “buy” the ticket. Of course I’m upset about this, but I pay the fee because I was literally at an Airbnb from doing a 7 day cruise with carnival and needed to get back home. I then arrive the next morning at 6am (flight isn’t until 7:55am) and I run into an issue with my luggage. Apparently the previous $480 that I spent did not include my 2 checked bag . At this point I’m trying to go through the line and pay with Apple Pay at the desk and they inform me they don’t have Apple Pay. Now I’m frantically trying to get money out of the atm that has posted that it’s tap to pay and it doesn’t work. I then shove my clothes into 1 suitcase and had to call customer service to pay for the bag over the phone because the option was not available online. After another 25 minutes on the phone everything is finally done. I get into line to give my bag up and go upstairs and in told I can’t load the plain because my luggage was too late. I was also told that I would have to pay an additional $99 per person to rebook my flight. I had a complete break down and nobody cared to help me make something work until I lost my mind. Only until then did the boss make the change without the money . Everyone at the front counter were rude and had very disgusting attitudes. I would definitely never recommend Spirit to anyone.",-1
2024-04-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Louisville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the epitome of incompetence,True,"  I had the unfortunate displeasure of flying with Spirit Airlines, and it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. The moment I stepped onto the plane, I was greeted with a putrid odor that lingered throughout the entire flight. The seats were like sitting on concrete blocks, providing zero comfort for the duration of the journey. To add insult to injury, our flight was delayed without any explanation, causing us to miss our connecting flight despite the fact that the plane was still at the gate. The airline's lack of coordination and communication left us stranded, missing two reservations and only provided a measly $42 for meals, which barely covered a fraction of the cost. We were forced to fly out the next morning, adding more inconvenience and stress to our already disastrous travel experience. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, our return trip was plagued by yet another delay, this time because they were waiting on someone else to board the plane. Spirit Airlines is undoubtedly the epitome of incompetence and negligence. Save yourself the trouble and never fly with them. They are consistently behind schedule and fail to provide even a semblance of decent service. Avoid at all costs.",-1

I will never fly with them again. I won't go in to all the details other than to say that the first flight was over 3 hours late, but there were so many other bad issues with this airline including their gate employees yelling at customers when they caused the chaos that confused everyone. The couple next to me at the airport waiting for our plane said the same thing, ""this is our first and last time flying with Spirit.""",-1

Rather than making an announcement to all passengers what the options would be, two agents were available to talk to one customer at the time, basically telling us that we can be stuck in Orlando for two days, or take the refund. None of it came with a sincere apology and people were left to their own devices at 11pm on a Wednesday night during spring break week where rebooking anything reasonably priced was out of the question. We ended up having to drive to Detroit (18 hours) and lost two days of vacation time. We will never fly with Spirit again. If we could enter 0/10, we would.",-1

At 11 pm on the 27th Wednesday, I received an email that my flight was canceled. At 5 am, I received notice that I was rebooked on Spirit for FRIDAY 29th at 8:30 PM. There were no weather delays and no issues with either airports. They were either overbooked for my flight or it was mechanical. Customer service would not disclose the true reason. I asked if they would put me on a Southwest flight (seating available) for today (Thursday evening) to get me down to Fort Myers, but they refused. I am in a wedding and I will miss the event if I fly out on Friday evening. I asked if they could fly me into Miami and I'd drive over 2 hrs to Fort Myers. They said that it would be an extra fee to rebook me to another airport and all flights were sold out for today & Friday to Miami. The cost for me to arrange a round trip ticket with another airlines is over $650 which I can not afford. So, now I am now having to drive 10 hrs each way for no fault of my own. This company should have a class action lawsuit filed for their actions. Customer service was the worst. I spoke to a so-called supervisor and he was a joke.",-1
2024-03-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,"will never fly Spirit again"" ",False,"   It was a Horrible Experience I book a flight from San Juan to Orlando on March 26,2024. The flight was scheduled to depart at 329pm and arrive in Orlando at 647pm. We boarded fine, we left the gate at 330pm and we went about 200 feet and the plane stopped for an hour then Captain said that we had Landing gear computer issues and we needed to get back to the Gate. So we did. We waited 4 hours at the gate. Leaving at 830 pm. So as of 830 it’s been 5 hours since we first boarded. So my point is The least Spirit can do is offer us Soda and snacks cause the food and beverages at the airport are very pricey. Also the seats are so uncomfortable. We finally landed at MCO at 1109. I will never fly Spirit again. A very disappointed customer",-1
2024-03-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Chicago,4.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,"pretty satisfied overall"" ",True,"   This was my first time in almost 15 years flying Spirit. I had sworn them off due to their high baggage fees and tendency to attract many noisy children. This time, I carried with me only a backpack, though it was quite stuffed. I had been concerned that Spirit might charge me a carry-on fee, and I was relieved and overjoyed (almost in disbelief) when that didn't happen. Basically, as long as you only have one bag and it can fit snugly underneath the seat in front of you, you're fine. The aircraft was clean and looked quite modern. I was seated in the second-to-last row and had three seats all to myself, as did the young man who sat across from me. The entire row of six seats behind me were empty (except when a FA sat down to eat his takeout dinner). The downsides are no IFE or WiFi (you'll have to bring a book) and you don't get any type of snack or beverage without paying (not even water), but for me this is no problem. For the lower airfare, I'm perfectly fine with bringing my own lunch and an empty plastic bottle through TSA to fill at the water fountains. Due to aircraft repositioning, we left the gate 45 minutes late, so I'll have to ding the airline at least half a star for that. The first officer (who spoke faster than John Moschitta) told us he would try to keep our airspeed up to try and make up some of that time, and he kept that promise as our flight time was a fairly brisk 2:22 (wheels up to wheels down). Pretty impressive considering the headwinds as we approached Chicago. Oh, and the lines at check-in moved very slow. I'm not a fan of the way Spirit lets people purchase tickets last-minute at the check-in counter as it holds up the lines. One thing before I forget: on the A321N aircraft that Spirit uses, there are NO WINDOWS in the very last row of seats. Many airlines (including Spirit) now charge fees for advance seat selection, so bear this in mind if you select a ""window seat"" and you wind up with empty bulkhead next to you. Spirit needs to be transparent about this. Other than this, I'm pretty satisfied overall and I'll certainly consider flying with Spirit again if I'm going on a short domestic trip where I only need one or two changes of clothes that I can fit into a backpack.",1
2024-03-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,airline to avoid at all costs,True,"  I recently had the misfortune of flying with Spirit Airlines and I can confidently say it was one of the worst experiences of my life. From rude flight attendants to unethical behavior and complete disregard for customer satisfaction, Spirit Airlines has proven itself to be a disgrace to the airline industry. The nightmare began before we even boarded the plane. Despite checking in online prior to our flight, their website conveniently decided to malfunction when it came to checking in myself, citing the excuse of having an infant on my lap. While my husband and daughter were granted their boarding passes without issue, mine was labeled with the ominous message ""must speak to agent at gate."" Upon arrival at the airport and seeking assistance, we were met with further incompetence and disrespect. Despite having paid for our flight like any other responsible passenger, we were informed that I would not be allowed on the flight due to overbooking. This absurdity was compounded by the fact that Spirit's own faulty online check-in system had prevented me from obtaining a boarding pass earlier. Rather than rectifying their mistake, Spirit Airlines was fully prepared to inconvenience my entire family, including a toddler, by making us miss the flight we had rightfully paid for. It took the intervention of multiple individuals to finally secure seats on a later flight, which only added to our frustration and stress. When we finally boarded the plane, the ordeal was far from over. I found myself squished between two strangers, forced to balance an infant on my lap for the duration of the flight. The lack of consideration for our comfort and safety was appalling, and it was abundantly clear that Spirit Airlines prioritizes profit over the well-being of its passengers. In conclusion, I urge anyone considering flying with Spirit Airlines to think twice. The blatant disregard for customer service, coupled with the sheer incompetence and rudeness displayed by their staff, make Spirit Airlines an airline to avoid at all costs. Save yourself the headache and choose a reputable airline that values its customers.",-1

Our flight was cancelled then rescheduled, after the first Cancellation we had to cancel our connecting flight. We lost money after rescheduling with Spirit then rescheduling our flight again they cancelled our flight again. We were out 460 dollars for the two flights we missed then 200 for the taxi then 600 for the difference in going with another company which by the way  was worth it in comparison to the garbage Spirit had to offer. From there we spent close to 2000 dollars in additional cost and simply lost money in general. Do yourself the favor and don’t use Spirit.",-1

Boarding scheduled at 4:46. I went to gate A12 at 4:30. The board indicated 8:00 pm to Seattle. No explanation. Seating was horrific. No place to wait three hours. You could take a seat at a slot machine. Disgusting food choices! I wonder the filthy halls. I return to gate A12 to find the gate was changed to A14 and the board read 10:00.. No comment from Spirit personal. Finally on the plane. When the beverage cart came along I asked for a coke and a bag of chips. The attendant said the choices are on the card. I said I didn't have my readers and plain chips would be fine. She proceeded to open the card and hold it in front of my face. The gal behind me said Pringles. I said thank you and she handed me a coke, cup of ice and a small can of Pringles. I looked at miss attitude and said I hope when your 72, be delayed 10 hours. Inconvenienced your pick up to the middle of the night that she doesn't have to deal with a twit like you. I will never fly Spirit again. Not because of the delays, that happens. It will because of the condescending, rude, disrespectful troll of an attendant.",-1
2024-03-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Las Vegas,1.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,telling me that I missed my flight,False,"  I had a flight leaving ATL to Vegas on March 15th at 9:24pm. I was at the gate at 7pm. When I got the gate the screen said flight is delayed. So as I'm sitting there so a guy asked the gate agent what time will the flight be here because now it's 10:33 and the gate agent went to get someone and the guy comes out and say I'm the supervisor and your flight left at 7pm. And I was like what? I showed him my phone where it's also saying that the flight is delayed so he told me don't go by what the screen say or my phone and kept telling me that I missed my flight. As we were talking a plane was arriving at the gate D2 and he said that's not your plane to Vegas I am the supervisor and I know what time your flight left. And told me to go back out of security to the front counter and they will give me another ticket. Well it was about 15 peoples sitting there and he told all of us that we missed our flight So we all left and did all that what he told us to and the front counter was closed until 3am the next day. As I'm standing there at the front counter my phone said the flight boarded at 10:46 pm. That's the flight that he said was not my flight. So now I'm pissed like why would he tell us that wasn't our flight when in fact it was. So now we missed the flight. And at 3am when the front counter open they can only give us a flight for the 17th which is a 14hour flight. I called customer service and they told me I wasn't at the gate on time. Remind you the 17th is a Sunday so I will have to miss out on the trip because I thought the gate agent was telling the truth and whole time he was telling me a big ass lie! If can't go by what the screen say and the gate agent say then I don't know who trust or ask anything. Then they gave 2 people's flights out for free for the next day, they gave 2 ppls a refund and so helped 2 more peoples after I ask if they could help me first. And all the other people's was just stuck trying to figure it out. And the only option was stay stuck for 1 1/2 days at the airport and travel out sunday on a 14 hour flight. This is crazy. And I just don't understand why would he lie to me and everybody else like that. I would have been missed up if I wasn't from Atlanta and would have been stuck for 2 days in another state that's crazy",-1

2024-03-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Aruba via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"Save yourself the headache"" ",True,"  I was scheduled for a 5 am flight to Fort Lauderdale and then a connecting flight to Aruba. The gate assignment was A18. We sat at gate A18 for 1 1/2 hours before departure. At some point the departing gate was changed to A17. Due to the horrible audio we didn't hear the announcement for the change. Instead of the attendants calling the names of the 10 people that were missing, she went through the waiting area of gate A17 aging people of the wanted to depart sooner. When we noticed that gate A18 had not boarded by 6:30 am, we approached gate A17 and asked what was gong on. The rude supervisor advised that it was up to the flight attendants if they wanted call the passengers name during the boarding process. She avoided speaking to us directly. She walked around the lobby pretending to fix the line dividers, while yelling out her responses. I asked the gate attendant for his name and the supervisor name, he provided his name but asked her if he could provide her name. Her name badge was purposely flipped over. Once again she yelled across the lobby stating I could ask her for her name myself. She continued to walk around as if she was working. One agent told us that our luggage didn't make the flight because we didn't make the flight. That was incorrect information. Our bags made the flight on February 18th, here it is February 22nd and still no luggage. Honestly, the attitudes of the works align with the service and environment of SPIRIT. Calling the airline customer service was just as bad. They do not accept accountability for anything that weant on. While waiting on my flight I had the honor of observing 4 passengers encounter servers different rude gate attendants at gate A18. If you are traveling that is okay with paying for horrible service as long a you get to where your going, then you may be okay with spirit. On the other hand, if you expect decent service for your hard earned dollar, go with a different airline. Save yourself the headache.",-1
2024-03-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to New York LaGuardia,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,"$99 for a carry on"" ",True,"  Words cannot express how furious and frustrated I am with spirit right now. I am certainly never going to take Spirit again, even if I have to pay fifty dollars or so more for a flight, and I highly recommend any potential Spirit flyers do the same. Spirit's customer service is absolutely terrible - they are inflexible and unsympathetic and I'd even go so far as to say that they're taking advantage of the desperation of some of their customers. they don't even have being a budget airline as an excuse, because I've taken JetBlue before and have had much better experiences. A little bit more on my experience this time (yes, I've taken spirit before and overall never really had a great experience, but this time really takes the cake). They would not let me onto the flight with my backpack, citing that it was too big - and maybe it was, a little, but that's certainly never been an issue before, not with any of the airlines I've flown at, and I fly decently often, since my family's fond of traveling, not to mention having to travel between home and college every break. I acknowledge that maybe it was an inch or so past the recommended dimensions since I was trying to bring back some course books I no longer needed, and while I wouldn't have been happy about it, I would've paid for it to be a carry-on willingly enough, if the price was something like 30 or even 50 dollars. It is my mistake, after all, even if, again, it's never been an issue before, and I've always been able to comfortably fit it under the seat. But the price was $99 for a carry on to a 2-hour long flight, which is almost certainly taking advantage of customers' desperation. This, by the way, was more than the price of the flight itself. When I balked at the price, the Spirit flight worker just said, stone-faced, that he didn't have time for this, and was I going to pay or not? Otherwise he'd shut the door and I'd have to take the next flight tomorrow. When I hesitated, deciding to try to repack things maybe so that it took up less room, he proceeded to do exactly that. So they didn't give me the time to do even that. Maybe coerced is too strong a word for it, but that's certainly how I felt in that moment - coerced into paying. After getting up at seven to make this flight (granted, I arrived an hour and a half early) and four months of a long, stressful winter quarter finished with a brutal finals week -- I just wanted to go home. The kicker was that there was plenty of space on the flight, nevermind that the bag could've gone under the seat just fine - half the overhead bins were empty! And I wasn't the only one flagged - another passenger literally had to toss a third of her bag's contents (hopefully it's not too expensive to replace) and a second was only able to make it through because another passenger was kind enough to split the space in their bag with her. At any rate, I do have another flight with spirit because I booked this as a round trip, but after that, I will never choose spirit again. Ever. I should've paid more attention to the complaints lodged. Absolutely terrible experience with them, 0/10 would not recommend. If you want cheap flights, there are certainly much better budget options out there.",-1
2024-03-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,the service was poor,False,"  I was not expecting much from the get go, but the service was poor. No complimentary water or snacks and the food you buy is expensive. Seriously $4.30 for a can of coke. While waiting in line I had a rude gate attendant send me to the back of the line even though I was in zone 2 and zone 3 was boarding. When I finally got to the desk again i was pulled to the side to measure my personal item to repack (the back easily fit in the slot with no issue as i had done this on the flight from Orlando a week prior). The flight was delayed by an hour before taking off and whilst in the air we had found out it would be delayed a further 30 minutes meaning I'd have to run through 3 terminals to check in and go through TSA at breakneck speed. Thankfully Orlando TSA is pretty good at getting people through fast and with the connector flight being transatlantic there was a long queue still to board. However the flight itself was incredibly uncomfortable even by budget standards. It would be suitable for anyone under 5 foot 9 but if you're over 6ft (like me) your back and legs will be in for a rough ride. Seriously Spirit there is a baseline even for budget airlines and you aren't even meeting that. The only benefit is that the cabin crew were cheeky and friendly.",-1

After waiting hours in Philadelphia airport with 3 small children trying to locate our carseat we were told it was in ""Costa Rica ""?. They gave us a loaner car seat to put my 3 yr old in to drive home 2 hrs and said they would be in touch and we would get reimbursed if they couldn't locate car seat. During that time we received conflicting info and lies from ""they couldn't find our car seat"" to ""it's at an auction in Philadelphia? What? When submitting a claim we were told I had to submit a receipt for the car seat in order to get reimbursed! A car seat that was received as a gift from my old coworkers.

2024-02-17,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to New Orleans,1.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,great if you’re on a budget,False,"  Everyone knows that Spirit is cheap and uncomfortable and charges a lot for baggage, seating and food. The way you do it is you pay for your bags in advance as you buy the ticket, check-in online and then bite the bullet on seating or pay. You can get a pop from a vending machine to save on money in the air. So, expect to spend about $43-$50 in addition to your fare each way. Our flight was full, so the seating was very uncomfortable and tight. The tray table in the seat in front of you is just a little ledge to set your drink on. I fortunately had an aisle seat for a small amount of comfort, but it was still bad. We took off and arrived on time, which is a huge selling point for Spirit. Overall, the carrier is great if you’re on a budget and want to save money. We saved about $100 each by flying Spirit with one checked bag and were thus able to afford a nice hotel room. I’d gladly fly them again.",1

Less than five days after booking, they changed the flight from nonstop to a ridiculous amount of time on a plane with a stopover that ended up getting to Vegas at 11 PM at night instead of 11 AM - which pretty much screwed me out of a whole day of already planned activities with my nieces and nephews. I only had these four days to see my family, so that was completely unacceptable. What did they offer me? A credit. This airline has no other flights available that work in the timeframe of my trip. My itinerary was carefully selected to coincide with an already paid-for shuttle to and from the airport AND a rental car. This was nothing but a huge money grab by Spirit Airlines. Never again. Expensive lesson learned! (And yes, I realize it's only $124, but it cost me over $500 to book an equivalent flight for the same dates!)",-1

Worse than that when I clicked on the link in my email to follow check-in from my phone it led me to a payment portal asking for $50. It was never explained what this was for. In order to get to my flight on time I paid the $50 and the application took me back to check-in without ever providing by boarding pass. This continued in a circular loop. Eventually, I found the kiosk in the airport and used my confirmation code there to get my boarding pass. I later found out the $50 dollars was a fee for having an agent print the boarding pass at the counter. Obviously I hadn't done this as I was charged this fee during online check-in while trying to get my electronic boarding pass. I waited for 40 minutes on the phone to talk to customer service after which I was transferred and they refused to give me a refund for the fee.

We were flying from Miami to Atlanta, and our flight was delayed for over two hours. We did not want to be stuck in that airport for so long. there was nothing to do. When we finally boarded, the plane was so dirty like nobody cleaned the plane.  Also somebody at the gate yelled at us because our bag was a little bit over the maximum weight. She almost made us pay $85! The flight attendants weren’t nice, and the food and beverages were so expensive. Water was four dollars each. In my experience, spirit airlines is the worst airline ever.

I will admit though when you’re making a reservation with spirit airlines, take the time to read their policies, so you won’t be surprised about things concerning seats, luggage, and carry-ons, because there are fees for those things.

I just want to say this is the last time they will get money from me, and all my family members. I had flown with them many years with my same back pack never had this issue before.

Before de boarding the plane, the captain said it was an air traffic control issue, nothing about weather. After requesting the accommodations, I was told no accommodations would be given since the cancellation was in their systems as “due to weather”. Anyone can check a weather app and see that there was no weather issue at either city (DFW to FLL). I stood in line at DFW to get to the ticket counter for almost 2 hours to be told that nothing could be done. I was on hold with customer service for the same amount of time and they also told me they could do nothing and directed me to speak to the people at the counter. The people at the counter told me to call customer service! I was given the complete runaround for hours just to basically be told “oh well”. I flew spirit just 6 months ago out of ATL and my flight was also delayed almost an entire day then too. Outside of changing my flight for 14 hours later, I was not given anything to help with paying for food, the extra day of parking I had to pay at my return airport, Uber from the diverted airport, nothing. This is the last time they will ever get a dime from me. Spirit is a trash airline with trash customer service. As consumers, we vote with our dollars and my dollars will go elsewhere as long as I continue to use air travel. And with the way things are going with airlines as a whole — how they continue to nickel & dime us for every tiny thing while also taking away amenities and services.",-1

We had an important appointment. We reached the airport at 4.30am for a 6.57am flight on 27th Dec (Wednesday). The flight was canceled without notice and the next flight offered was 3 days later on 30th (Saturday). Please no not take this airline if you have an appointment or even if you are on vacation. Losing 3 days is horrible! We were stranded and finally we had to book from another airline. This was my first trip on Spirit. Will never ever take this in my life nor would recommend for anyone.,-1

Their customer service is all foreigners who hang up on you. The girl in Columbus told us it was still in fort Lauderdale and laughed. We have a couple thousand dollars of personal items on it.

Customer service is trash. I flew from LA to ATL for my brothers funeral then back from ATL to LA and i was over charged (almost $300 for 2 bags) one way and then when i asked questions on my way back, they said i was overcharged but proceeded to charge me $125 plus $99 for my luggage. I also paid for WIFI and flex pass and they didn't even have WIFI and wouldn't let me use my credit for food or drinks on the flight.

Just getting a customer service rep is near impossible. 2 hrs on hold. Still nothing. Website is useless. The last time I flew Spirit they had to do several attempts to land.

2023-12-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The worst travel experience,False,"  The worst travel experience of my life. First, our plane was delayed by 2 hours because they ""could not find the pilot"" (how do you lose a pilot, their words, not mine). Then, after our short 2 hour flight to the destination airport, as we are circling the airport to make a landing, the pilot announces that ""one of the airstrips where we were going to land is tore up so we can't land and we are running out of fuel so we have to make an emergency landing at another airport so we can refuel"". First, the airstrip is tore up??  Once we land, the crew finally decides to tell us that we will not be able to leave because the pilot is over his allowed flight miles for the day! They just straight up lied to us before saying we were only going here to refuel so we could fly back. No, we were grounded, stuck in a city 2 hours away from our destination at an airport that Spirit does not fly out of! So once they finally get us off this plane (took them about an hour to do so) we are pretty much left in the airport without anyone telling us what is going on (remember this is not a Spirit airline so there are not Spirit workers here and the airplane crew did not leave the plane with us! we found out later that they were shuttled to a nearby hotel while we cluelessly and aimlessly stumbled around an empty airport at midnight). After a couple hours of sitting in the airport wondering what was going to happen to us, one of the Spirit general managers showed up. He told us that they were going to get our luggage off the plane, and then told us that busses were coming to pick us up. After another couple hours (keep in mind this is all in the middle of the night, it's about 4am at this point) he finally tells us that there are no busses coming! Our two options are: 1) stay in this nightmare scenario and go to a hotel until they could get us a flight out at 10am or 2) do what I should have done when I first landed and buy an Uber to the other airport which is a two hour drive away.  I could have figured that out myself if you all would have just been honest from the start and not jerked us around for hours on end. So, a 2 hour Uber ride later ($130!) I am back at the airport where we were supposed to land and now can finally get my car to drive 3 hours back home at 6am with about 1 hour of sleep. After multiple phone calls and multiples emails, I just keep getting the same , bottled response. ""This flight was not delayed for over 2 hours so we cannot reimburse you but here is a $50 voucher for your next Spirit airlines flight. This voucher will expire in 2 months"".",-1
2023-12-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Minneapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Fly at your own risk,False,"  Fly at your own risk. Booking with Spirit would be leaving you to chance. You already have to contend with poor conditions. It is to be expected it is a cheap flight. However, to fly with a lay over flight and to be stranded without any recourse is ludicrous. My family and I fly frequently, and Spirit is by far the worst flight and getting worse. The final, amongst many unfortunate events is, we boarded our departing flight to be left on the tarmac for 3 hours. To finally arrive at our connecting flight with 10 mins to spare. They refused to board us. They told myself and the other passengers to wait for an email of a rescheduled flight. The email said that they would not fly us out until the next day in the afternoon. They also callously included they will not accommodate us with a hotel and this was our only choice. This trip was intended to be a turnaround trip with a return flight already secured. Getting there in the afternoon would be senseless. Spirit refused to remedy the situation. They refused to return us home and said we are responsible for the flight from departure to connecting flight and if we were to get reimbursed it would only be from a portion and is under review if any at all. Everyone of their representatives are cold hearted, as if they had a training on how to execute the worst customer service and to be inhuman.

This is by far the worse experience I ever had with Spirit out of all the years I have been flying. On the day of 11-21-23 my flight got delayed by 4 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight in Fl to return home to Cleveland. Therefore, I got stuck at the airport for 14 hours and had to book with another airline company to ensure that I would make it home in time to be with my family. On top of that, I had to call off of work so I missed out on money. This was truly horrible and I will never fly with them again. Please anyone save yourself the headache.

Try to get in touch with an agent to see if I can be on an earlier flight she said there was no earlier flight. Also my other flight from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando delayed till Monday morning.

2023-11-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Oakland via Orinda,2.0,,1.0,,2.0,1.0,2.0,“avoid this airline at all costs”,True," This is the third time my flight delay (caused by Spirit) has turned into an overnight stay for me or my mother as we headed back and forth to my uncle's passing, funeral and celebration of life service and every time a Spirit delay caused us to miss our connection, first from Atlanta to Orange County then to Oakland, then from Atlanta to Vegas to Oakland. In Orange County upwards of 20 people were left stranded when a Spirit pilot elected to taxi away from the gate rather than wait for a number of passengers heading to the Bay Area to board the plane. We literally had to beg the airline to provide us reservations since the missed connection left us stuck there for nearly 24 hours. I missed my connection because Spirit delay causing me and about a dozen others to miss the connection to Oakland. This time Spirit refused to provide us with hotel accommodations or even meal vouchers - we were on our own for the next 15 hours or so. Now tonight my 84-year old mother experienced the same thing. Her flight left five hours late from Atlanta. Rather than be considered a no-show she caught the flight and will arrive in Vegas at 1:30am in the morning and won't leave until 5:30pm tonight. Also no hotel, but this time they present a $20 food voucher (which at an airport buys not much). Mind you, bad weather has never been an issue in these case...this is about Spirit's inability to schedule correctly. So as I said - unless you have a lot of extra time to get where you're going and $$$ to pay for food and a hotel at unintentional stopovers - I would avoid this airline at all costs.",-1

2023-11-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Atlanta,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,low cost airline who hides the bigger cost,True," Spirit Airline, (S-pirate) low cost airline who hides the bigger cost. Be aware to read and check the information about the fee of this airline, I had a bad experience with them. I checked in online through their app and website, the fee for check in bag is $49 and all processes went through without charging my debit card so I wanted to make sure all was good, I went to the Kiosk to double check and they were going to charge me $89 which is double the price. One staff member came over and helped me do the payment through the App again but it did not go through, it said I already modified the ticket! So went to counter service, the staff were not friendly and only pointed out that you must pay $89 at the machine, I tried to describe what happened with their App! The supervisor came to me and pointed out “its up to you if you want to pay or not fly with them”, this is unacceptable they do not train staff to assist customers but force customers to pay through their unworkable system. I will not recommend any travel with Spirit Airlines as you cannot control your budget of traveling, their is a lot of fees and many tactics to suck your money, overall its not a low cost airline but lower profile in aviation industry.",-1
2023-11-15,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Tampa,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,have always had a good experience,False,"  I have flown Spirit Airlines on many occasions. I have always had a good experience. The flight attendants and pilots have always been very courteous. Yes, it is true, that they charge for almost everything, however, considering the low fare at certain times it is still a cheaper bargain than other airlines. Their planes are the newest fleet in the industry, they are well maintained and clean. I consider flying on Spirit Airlines to basically be a 2-3 hour bus ride. If people want to pay $450 for the same flight on another airline, just simply to get a little bag of peanuts, then that is their wasteful decision.",1
2023-11-15,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Los Angeles,,,,,,,3.0,Refused reimbursement for a cancelled flight,True,"  Refused reimbursement for a cancelled flight due to Covid-19 sickness. Three days before the departure of my scheduled Spirit flight, I was diagnosed with Covid-19. I communicated immediately the airline representatives of my decision to cancel my scheduled domestic flight on Sept 1st, by phone and by Chat. The received answer was that I will receive an initial refund, and later I will be contacted by email to provide further proof of my sickness, in order to receive the reimbursement for the cost difference of the cancelled flight. Soon I got an email from them with a support number, and because of their extenuating circumstances, the response by email will be longer than normal, but within 30 days. To be sure of letting them know of my condition at the cancelled flight I answered that email a few days after with the medication label image attached with my name. A few days after the 60 days passed from the cancelled flight, and not getting their email request for providing further proof of my sickness, at my own initiative I provided them my doctor’s certification of my condition at the time of the canceled departure. Their answer was that my request was denied because I didn’t answer their email sent to me a month later, containing the request for the documentation of my medical condition at the time of my canceled flight. In fact I didn’t receive that email at all. Even if it could have been lost in my Spam folder, which was highly unlikely, still the medication label I sent them very early was clearly confirmed by my doctor certification letter which I provided them later. After al these, despite of the fact that I proved my condition at the time of the flight by both documents, they still maintained their denial. I could easily board the flight in my sick condition without being noticed by the flight personnel. I suggest anyone to consider my experience when thinks about booking a Spirit airline flight. Still, even if I didn’t get the full reimbursement, I definitely do not regret cancelling that flight for the sake of the other passengers",-1

They don’t tell you about that until you get to the gate. The only other option the customer service agent gave me was to leave my bag at the airport where it would be disposed of.

Called it and they directed me back to the desk because they don't have access to booking flights and no one at the desk! Then directed me to some live chat thing and the result was..my issue will be resolved in 30-60 days!!l So in summary, I was left stranded in the airport with no flight home, no way to find lodging, not even an offer to cover food!

They changed the gate without sending message or an announcement when I landed in Vegas. I had only 10 minutes to get to the new gate and I lost my flight because gate 15 counter was busy and no any sign or person to let me know that the gate is changed. Their employees are not trained properly and nobody give you a clear solution.

All the passengers were boarded and then we just sat. Eventually we were told to exit the plane as there were some, “maintenance issues.” They had customers who had connecting flights with a one hour layover come to the front desk to discuss what they needed to do (rebook). They told me since I had a two hour delay at my connecting airport that I didn’t need to worry about it. An hour later, I finally went up to the front desk as they were not boarding the flight yet. They said, “we haven’t heard anything” over and over again. Finally we were all notified that the flight was cancelled. I was offered a rebook through them or a refund. This trip was extremely important to me. They just played it off like it meant nothing. In fact, they acted like they were doing me a favor by rebooking. They would only rebook through their airline, and will not put the customer first by looking for the best options. The fees for luggage are more expensive than most, the weight limit for a checked bag is only 40 lbs. You have to pay extra for a carry on. I could go on and on.

He was very patient and thorough. We really appreciate his efforts. The actual ride was fine, not much leg room and have to pay for drinks but Glen’s customer service was great.",1
2023-10-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Orlando,1.0,,4.0,,,3.0,1.0,What a mistake trying Spirit,False,  What a mistake trying Spirit. My 9am flight got moved to 7pm. How do you change a flight by 10 hrs. So I made it 6:30 am and they changed that to 6am. Flight home was all set for 10:40 am mobile checked in and then it got canceled while I was sleeping. No apparent reason given. Weather is fine all along east coast so it wasn't for weather. They are just terrible. Sorry I tried them. Oh and the 40lb bag stuff sucks too. Leg room sucked. The flight itself was surprisingly good. No turbulence good takeoff and landing.,-1
2023-10-20,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Cartagena to Phoenix via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never use this airline again,False,"  The only thing that is cheap with this airline is the service and the comfort inside the plane they are using. Traveling from Cartagena to Phoenix, via Fort Lauderdale I was charged twice - $90 and $75 respectively - for 10lbs overweight of my checked baggage (that I had to pay extra for when I bought the ticket), for a total of $180. I was also charged for a seat in the emergency exit row, where there is more leg room, but the seat does not recline.... They seats are thinly upholstered, so that my back hurt when I reached Phoenix after four hours. There is no net to keep a water bottle, snacks, or magazines, no entertainment, and no place to charge your phone. I expressed my frustration over the $180 charge for the overweight bag, to the attendant at the Fort Lauderdale airport, making it very clear that it was the company I was frustrated about, not the attendant. She just shrugged it off, and when I arrived in Phoenix, my bag mysteriously had hot left Fort Lauderdale even though I was two hours early for my flight. There is no lost-baggage desk for Spirit in Phoenix. I was directed to go upstairs to the main check-in, and there was a line of other, very unhappy passengers. One of them, an African American man was crying, saying that he was being laughed at by the attendant. This is where I learned that my bag would not make it to Phoenix until the next day, which meant that I had to change my flight to Page Arizona until later in the day, loosing half a day that I could have spent on my way to Grand Canyon. I will never use this airline again. I ended up paying more for my flight than on American Airlines, which I have used for the same route before. Their marketing is disingenuous, manipulative and their add-ons for overweight luggage are usurious, taking full advantage of the notion that it is very unlikely that a passenger will ditch contents of his/her luggage to avoid paying for overweight.",-1
2023-10-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boise to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines is the worst,True,"   Spirit Airlines is the worst. Cancelling flights last minute. Can’t get ahold of customer service in order to get flights rebooked. We could never get through to customer service, wait times given are the not ones that were promised to us by the apps or the phone lines or texting The group of us all tried to mad rush to rebook or try to rebook a flight that we were not planning on being cancelled. We all tried different methods and We ended up having to go through different airlines.",-1

2023-10-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“the worst airline to deal with”,False, Spirit decided that they had a schedule change so they change my flight meaning I miss my appointment and the whole reason I’m traveling. They refuse to refund the ticket. Absolutely the worst airline to deal with. Their customer service doesn’t care. This is the absolute worst airline I’ve ever done business with. Pay the extra money and fly on any other airline.,-1

2023-10-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Medellin to Kansas City,,,,,,1.0,1.0,the worst airline ever,False,  This is without a doubt the worst airline ever. First they charge you almost a full ticket for being 2 lbs over weight with your luggage then they charge you for seats they can’t even give you a complementary glass of water on the flight. Then they changed the gate I was supposed to leave out of didn’t even announce they changed the gate when I asked one of the workers about the flight he couldn’t tell me anything at all then when I finally found out they changed the gate I had to run all the way to the other side of the terminal and still missed the flight. Then they tried to say that it was my fault that I missed the flight and I had to spend the night at the airport because even though they changed the gate without notice they said it was my fault I missed the flight. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy. And I will never fly this airline again. I don’t know how the hell they are still in business as bad as they are.,-1
2023-10-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,,,,,,1.0,1.0,I was unable to use the credit,False,"  In August I booked a total of 12 one way flights from Orlando to Philadelphia for Sunday 8/20 at 3:15. Spirit.com timed out for the first purchase of 9 tickets, and I had to speak to customer service to continue with the booking. I told the gentleman that we only needed 5 checked bags total which was applied to the first traveler. The second booking was done online for 3 travelers and we added only 1 checked bag. Your system added one checked bag for the 8 other travelers on the first booking- so that’s 13 total and for 2 more on the second booking for a total of 3. I did not add those bags- the site did. Spirit overcharged us $645.01 and has cost countless hours on the phone & utilizing the “live chat” text feature. I was told I could only get a credit not a refund even though it was Spirit’s error. That blows my mind. The site is not user friendly; I’ve read many other comments and reviews that match my complaint identically regarding your weak technology. We were in Florida for an untimely death in the family and the last thing we should have been worried about was getting our family home. Spirit did not make it easy. The first time I was on the phone your supervisor who conveniently disconnected me. I tried to get her back on the phone but could only get a customer care representative- ironic because no one really cares. She said she’d call me back in 20 minutes. Never did I get an email or call from her. I tried to call your corporate office and could not get any person on the phone. This is disgusting. In our darkest hour Spirit Airlines took advantage of a grieving family. I tried calling again and was transferred and no one could help. Finally, I did see my credit was issued. This was the text conversation I had. “Hi! Thank you for contacting Spirit. My name is xxxxx and I will be more than happy to assist you further with your overcharged for checked luggage inquiry. Please allow me a few moments to look at your reservation, gather information, and start working on your request. I do apologize for the wait time. You’ve been issued a reservation credit which is valid for trips booked within 90 days of issuance on any flight dates available in the system. It can be used for multiple bookings until the full value is used and can be applied toward airfare, bags, seats, taxes, and fees. Any Guest linked to the original reservation can use it. Amount: $567.01 Expiration Date: 12 November 2023 I have sent your confirmation to the email you have provided. It may take up to an hour for you to receive this email. If you still are not seeing your confirmation after one hour, please reach back out to us.” It says any guest can use and the total amount is listed. It’s actually $650.00 because we booked 3 more flights separately- a total of 12 flights. Today, 10/1, I tried to use that credit. My husband and I paid for those 12 flights, yet the credits were issued individually. Even though it’s clear we paid, I was unable to use the credit to purchase my airfare. I first spoke with an agent who was unable to help me so transferred me to the loyalty department where I spoke with another staff who informed me the voucher credits could not be transferred to me, the person who paid. I think “loyalty department “ is ironic Imagine if this is happening to others the money spirit is making. I couldn’t reach corporate either. Our flight was no picnic either. Just awful service. Disgusting!",-1
2023-10-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Louisville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,they are the worst in every way,False,"  I usually support Spirit they are the only non stop flight to Kentucky so I put up with the small seats, no food, and up charge for literally everything but I tell myself you get what you pay for so it’s ok. This time was ridiculous! My bag was over by 2 pounds so I took out my purse which helped. Then I got stopped as boarding the plane because I had two items. My back pack and a purse. They said consolidate or pay. When I consolidated my purse into backpack it did not fit their size requirements so they then charged me $99.00 for my empty purse. I will never fly Spirit again, they are the worst in every way.",-1
2023-10-01,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Alexandria to Orlando,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,3.0,Nothing good or special about it,False,"  Spirit airlines is merely just a way to get from point a to B. Nothing good or special about it. Seats were terrible. And the tray tables,   I could barely fit my hand on it. Windows were dirty, very dirty. And the landing was not good. But they did provide food and snacks that were decent which is a upside. But I had to innovate to find something to prop my phone up on which I did (only use for the tray table basically). But at least I got to my destination.",-1
2023-09-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Kansas City,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,Poor customer service,False,"  I was charged 3 xs for the same bag as I could not get clarification on purchase or not for my bag. Their check-in process sucks online for baggage. Make sure your bags to do not exceed weight limit after you already purchased prior bag weight limit (to save cost on baggage as their website states)as they will not refund your money of prior purchase. Make sure you get a receipt as they charge you even though I did not get a receipt when they said I had. Poor customer service. You have to purchase food and drink on the plane. Seats small (and I am a small person). No one will call you back, they just blame on the next person you should have talked to at the airport, not when you leave! I have never had any problems with any other airlines! Please fly anyone other than this airline because they could not care less about their customers! I have reached out to my credit card company as well to dispute charges!",-1

The guy at the head of the entrance was abusive to everyone who walked passed him because, even though there was no sign saying that the beginning of the line was not actually the beginning of the line, everyone took the beginning of the line as such. When I called him out for being abusive towards a woman who did not speak English he threatened me. Look how there were several people just trying to check their bags (we all paid a lot of money to do so) and how only one person checking bags. It was horrible and abusive treatment not customer service.",-1
2023-09-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Atlanta via Baltimore,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,I would not recommend Spirit Airlines,True," The first half of my non-stop roundtrip flight was canceled due to alleged mechanical difficulties. Instead of my nonstop flight to ATL, Spirit automatically transferred me to their next available flight which was leaving at 9pm arriving the following day in Baltimore, Maryland and arriving in Atlanta that night, after a 6-hr layover, which was after the time that my daughter was supposed to pick me up from the airport and then we were going to drive to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. So, just so you know, I got to the airport 56 miles from where I live. Unfortunately, I did not get the email notification, which must have come a day or so earlier. I work full time and had reserved round trip airfare 2 weeks prior. I didn't receive the email. In any case, I got to the LAX parking for the week I had requested off and got on the shuttle to the airport where I went to confirm my flight and at that point noticed on the Spirit app that my flight was going to Baltimore Maryland. So I called customer service and they said oh that was a layover and that I would be arriving in Atlanta at some point I don't know 9:00 pm the following night and that was too late for me because we were driving to the Myrtle Beach from ATL for a presentation that was going to be happening midday. So customer service rescheduled me to the best they could do. It was going to already be a 6-hour drive to Myrtle Beach from Atlanta with non-stop roundtrip airfare. So now I am faced with a four hour delay to leave LAX, a 6-hour layover in Baltimore plus the 6-hour drive to help my daughter drive to Myrtle Beach for her presentation. I didn't really have any other options. I tried to get a fight to Myrtle Beach, but that was going to also arrive in Myrtle Beach after the presentation was over. I would not recommend Spirit Airlines. Spend an extra $100-$200 and fly with another airline. Many have all-inclusive fees anyway. I understand it may seem like more. But you want customer service if something goes wrong after the 24-hour grace period before your flight leaves. A text message would have sufficed.",-1
2023-09-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Jamaica,,,,,,1.0,1.0,"they changed our flight"" ",False," We had booked with Spirit to go to Mexico on 9/22-24/23, when I arrived at airport at 5:45am, I was told they changed our flight without contacting me!

Now my birthday trip was ruined!",-1
2023-09-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Pick another airline,True,"  Hands down the worst flying experience I have ever experienced. Flight was diverted due to a storm and because we were running low on fuel. We were told we needed to divert to refuel, but then all of a sudden the slight crew had reached the maximum amount of time that they could work for the day and we were told to deplane. From there, we experience a total of 6 flights delays and were stuck at the diverted airport for 7 hours. We did not take off from the diverted airport until 2 in the morning. We experienced another delay once they finally boarded us after 7 + hours of delay, only to sit on the runway for another hour. There was zero communication from the airline during the 7 + hour ordeal. This airline is inefficient, understaffed, and a hot mess. I would never book through Spirit again. Pick another airline.",-1

One second I'm boarding then the next I'm back in the lobby with a 3 hour delay which would make me miss my connecting flight. And the resolution i was told was there's nothing we can do but give you a refund or get you a flight the next day. Lost a day on hotel reservations and not to mention wedding plans got delayed. I Should have gone with my gut feeling and never bought from spirit. A complete wasn't of time. And the customer service help desk was incompetent.,-1
2023-09-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Refused to give us accommodation,True,"  To begin with originally booked a direct flight with Spirit from Orlando to Las Vegas for 19th September. Booked this months ago and was cancelled and altered 4 times up until the day of departure. In the end it was changed to a stopover flight in Houston with a 40 minute wait in Houston. Sounded OK. We boarded the flight at gate 86 and were seated for a 4.26pm departure, when at 4.15 the captain comes out and said they have an engineering problem and we all needed to leave the plane and they will find an alternative. Eventually we were told a new plane would fly us at 6.00 pm from terminal 91.This is what happened, leaving at 6.26.We arrive at Houston stranded, along with other passengers who were travelling to Las Vegas as well. No further flights to Las Vegas available when we arrived at 8pm. We go to the service desk who told us because the flight was delayed due to Weather, we have no recourse. Rang their customer service who implied we were lying about these events. Refused to give us accommodation. On their records it was a weather issue. Amazing this conclusion, as it’s not often you change planes because of weather! Quite unbelievable a company operates like this and couldn’t even tell on their computer that planes were replaced.",-1

I am so happy to fly Spirit because on top of no layover, the customer service is great.

Attendants were ok but still bossy, no free snacks, it's not like they are the cheapest, they are bad but not cheap and they charge $95 per bag. Seats are so uncomfortable, (but I'll give this, their leg space is much better that others airlines). Overall this is the worst airline out there and laws should regulate mire this aspect.",-1

Tried to add checked bag on line for days prior to flight. Continuously received ""Oops, something went wrong. Try again"". Note everything else on app was working fine. Had to check bag upon arrival to airport which was $20 higher than online ($60 online/$89 at airport). Couldn't get help reducing that cost even though issue was with Spirit's system. - Lower bag weight minimum than quality airlines which means they can add additional ""overweight"" baggage fees. Another $125. - We paid $214 to check one bag. Now the cost of the ""cheaper"" flight was more than a high quality airline! - You have to pay for in flight water, drinks, snacks. Again, would have been better and cheaper to book on a high quality airline where you don't have to pay for these. While waiting in line to check bags, all 3 Spirit clerks were tied up with travelers having issues. They did not move them aside while they got these worked out to keep line moving. One clerk allowed family to check bags and then waited for other family members to arrive at the airport and jump up front to check their bags. Then they all had to empty and rearrange bags to help with weight. No in-flight entertainment or free Wifi for entertainment on app like other airlines. Yep, you guessed it, you have to pay extra for that! Flight attendant spent nearly 20 minutes ""selling"" Spirit and a Spirit credit card. Passengers had to sit and listen to this person go on and on and on. - Seats were in terrible shape - ripped, faded, etc.",-1

I was due to arrive in DFW at 11.30pm central time but did not arrive till after 1.30am central. On my return flight the very next day back to FLL from DFW scheduled to leave at 2:38pm central did not actually leave until 3.45 central and again nothing for my trouble. When we arrived at FLL we had to wait on the plane for about 20 minutes until they could pull up to the terminal and again, nothing for my trouble.

But Spirit charged US$178 for the hand carry which was less than 7 kg; and now kiwi says I never request or paid for the baggage. I forwarded my receipts that was charged by Spirit to kiwi. Both kiwi and Spirit cheated us by proving us a cheaper ticket in one hand and charging us unreasonably very very high amount just to carry a small hand carry of less than 7 kg which supposed to absolutely free as per the kiwi at the time of booking. So, never buy air ticket from kiwi.com and never fly with Spirit Airlines. The same bag was allowed for free for the same tickets in connecting Westjet flight from Phonix to Calgary.",-1

And I repeated that I bought it with the measurements that spirit have on the website.

Then I went to your front desk and it said 56 lb like I only remove one pound of things and I had a whole huge bag in my hand. So I remove more. Then it weighed 47 lb I removed seven more pounds and weighed all the stuff that I removed and it was quite over the amount that it was told to me removed. But the scale said I was still 1 lb over but they let allowed back to pass. Which it's all nonsense to even have a 40 lb and then you have to pay $125 overage totally unacceptable policies.

After landing at Orlando to get on my connector flight, we sat on the tarmac for approximately 45 minutes waiting to off load. By the time I exited my flight, my connector flIght had taken off, I stood in line for an hour and an half waiting to talk to customer service. She informed me the next plane available to my destination wasn’t available for another 24 hours. I asked if I may have a voucher to get a hotel. She said the best they can do is give me a 10% off coupon for any hotel room in the area. That didn’t help me one bit so I went to retrieve my checked luggage to see that it wasn’t at the carousel. I walked over to Spirit lost baggage department and I was told that it should be waiting for me in Arizona. Next day I arrived in Arizona and no luggage!

Once we were boarded they told us the pilots for this plane were having difficulties with the plane they're flying in from. They gave us no other information. We ended up being held on the plane for 2.5 hours before taking off. The flight itself was only 2 hours. We were not only not offered any water or light snacks, they wouldn't even allow us to purchase. We couldn't get off and get them ourselves either because we had no idea when the plane would take off and could miss the flight if we got off the plane. Employees completely lacked empathy and did not care. They acted like they were being inconvenienced that passengers wanted water, all while the employees were drinking water and snacks they brought and laughing with each other. If this weren't being the only direct flight into Atlantic City near my family, would never use this airline.",-1

I canceled my flight 30 days before I was scheduled to leave and didn't realize I wouldn't get a full refund. They gave me a ticket voucher for 1/2 of the original cost and only 90 days to use it.

We have been giving vague reasons why we are here, the staff don't seem to care. I spent $76 on my ticket and another $64 to have a carry on bag to miss my event. This is just horrible, the delay is longer than the flight.",-1

My direct flight was cancelled and replaced with another flight through Fort Lauderdale with a 4 hour layover. The flight from Fort Lauderdale was delayed 3 times.  None of the spirit staff showed interest in my inconvenience and none of them were willing to help. As a result of all this my 2 hour flight turned into a 14 hour trip, impacting my arrival time which affected some business that I needed to take care of on Saturday. When I arrived it would be too late to conclude my business and I was not able to complete my business on Sunday since it is a day off for most people. This is my first and last time flying Spirit airlines.",-1
2023-08-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Minnesota,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,a miserable bunch of employees,True," Flew to Vegas via Delta. Trip was great! Customer service was excellent and the price was great. We had comfortable seats, check in bags only cost $30, seats were $28 each, on flight movie, complimentary beverages, everything went smoothly. Jump ahead to trying to get our flight back to Minnesota. Rude employees at the desk, we couldn't get the bag tags to print and the person whose job it was to help appeared to be busy doing something else, we had to pay an extra $79 per bag for 2 of the bags, and the rude employee behind the desk was so busy talking and being rude that by the time we went to check our bags at the self serve counter, we had missed our flight and was not allowed to board! I asked for the manager and a rude woman who stated she was the ""supervisor "" came out and acted like we were irrelevant! On top of that the next flight they had was for the next day at 2pm Saturday and stated we would also had to pay an additional $99 per person (3 of us) for them accommodating us?, the flight we missed was at 4.30pm Friday. We will never, ever, fly Spirit again and I suggest the same for anyone reading this. They are overpriced, rude, no empathy, unapologetic, and a miserable bunch of employees. Aren't these jobs customer centered? The customer's are the reason they have a job and can pay their bills and take care of their families. Spirits reviews are so horrible, I would be surprised if they lasted another 2 years. I really hope they don't. I think Delta and Sun Country have mastered what customer service is and do not price gouge.",-1

Horrible customer service, we booked a flight from LA to Orlando and had no problems until we were at the Orlando flight for spirit to go to Boston. The spirit workers are rude, especially one girl at the counter who kept stopping us because we couldn’t bring our shoulder bag along with our luggage. We even had bags that held food from airport near our gate and she STOPPED us and said we couldn’t board unless it’s stuffed in our luggage/backpacks. The rules are so inconsistent because we were able pass the first flight without issues. There were only 10 minutes for our flight and yet she was rude, yelled, harassed and even threatened to close the door gate just because we were trying to follow her rules by putting our bags into our luggage. After a good few minutes of that she then began to tell every single one of my family members to measure the luggage/bags to see if they fit while knowing we only had a few minutes to board. There was 8 of us and we managed to get in on time except for one because of the horrible customer service. No friendly staff. And we had to pay an extra 200 dollars for two luggage’s that “weren’t acceptable”, we are getting it refunded anyways because it’s stupid. All that just for the flight to be uncomfortable, no free beverages or snacks (better off buying it outside the plane), 20 dollar wifi, and some rude flight attendants. Never again will me and my family go to spirit.",-1

Our flight was cancelled three months before our departure. We were never notified. When we arrived for our return flight home from vacation they gave us the bad news. Spirit offered to book a flight out for us the next day for an additional $2000! The money we spent buying the original ticket could only be used as a credit on Spirit Airlines - no refund to use with a different airline. We lost our direct flight home and needed taxi for 8 people and two hotel rooms to spend the night. After putting up a good battle the supervisor waived the additional $2000 fee but would not compensate us for the taxi and hotel rooms - after all, they did us a favor by waiving the additional fee. Talk about gaslighting and making the airline look like the “victim”. We will never fly Spirit again no matter how good a deal it is.",-1
2023-08-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Washington,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,last time traveling with Spirit Airlines,False,  First of all they broke down my luggage lock in LAX while I even didn't lock my luggage. I didn't know I can file a claim about that. Then the flight was very poor and horrible from LAX to DC. The seats were very uncomfortable for such that long distance flight. For sure it was my last time traveling with Spirit Airlines.,-1
2023-08-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Miami,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,last time flying with this poor airline,False,"  Our flight form Cleveland got delayed 5 times. It was almost an hour away when they completely cancelled. Of course, by that time we had our bags checked and went through security. I have 4 little kids so imagine the whole experience. They lied and said that Miami airport is closed but in fact Miami airport was still open and many flights arrived there after our flights. Then we waited in line and got nothing but a refund without considering our hotel and car reservations. I called and chatted with their representatives, the worst ever. Very rude and hung up on us many times. The last time they offered us a credit as a compensation but then didn't process it. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Of course, our very last time flying with this poor airline. Cheap for a reason!",-1
2023-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Miami,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,very poor customer service,False," Terrible. Horrible. Supervisors and managers have very poor customer service. Believe all the bad reviews that were put here because this is the worst airline so far. First time booking with them and i regretted it. This airline will just take your money. Don’t even consider flying with them because of the cheap tickets because i swear you will end up paying more like triple once the flight will have a problem. No vouchers. They put me and my kids in so much stress. Please save yourself from any hassle and stress and just do not book any flights with them. Take note! They charge everything, from your baggage, seats, and even water. No complimentary services offered. Will surely never fly with them.",-1

I booked a flight a few weeks in advance that would arrive at my destination by 10:40pm. It seemed that I wouldn't have any issues even with a slight delay. However, on the day of the flight, 1.5 hours before the scheduled departure, I was notified of a 5 hour delay. I made every attempt to find another flight that would arrive before 2am (already an inconvenient time). However, all other scheduled flights to my destination had already departed. I contacted representatives at the airport and online to which I was informed I could be refunded but also cancel my flight. This was not an option as I needed to keep the flight to make an early morning interview. They would not offer anything to make it right. I will not be flying with Spirit at any point in the future due to this experience.",-1

Worst layover times and on top of that delays for a little drizzle. Worst flight I’ve ever been on. Seats were intolerable. Management has no answers about why there are delays after delays and no idea when we will take off. Wasted my first day in Florida. Cant wait to never fly Spirit again. Flight attendants were top tier. Thanks for your service. Did I mention there’s no free peanuts? Theyre just selling food and WATER.,-1
2023-08-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Antonio,,,,,,1.0,1.0,treatment of my sister is unconscionable,True,"  My special needs sister travels from her home in Las Vegas to visit me in San Antonio every year for about the last 15 years. For some reason, our mother chose Spirit this time instead of Southwest. It is our routine to escort her directly to the gate so she won't get lost in the airport, and have someone meet her on the other side at the gate. She is fully capable of traveling by herself with these provisos. We always make sure the airline knows that someone will be meeting her, just as you would do with a minor child. August 10th, 2023, I put her on a flight, and luckily, I stayed in the waiting area to make sure the plane took off OK. Next thing I know, they are bringing my sister back out. They had kicked her off the flight because ""they didn't want to take responsibility for her"". They said she'd done nothing wrong, but the captain didn't want her on the flight. I hate to think what would have happened had I left the airport! They would have just left her there at the gate, not knowing what to do. We then had to spend an extra $560 for a Southwest flight to get her home. This is not only deplorable, it is illegal. It is a breach of contract, especially when they admitted she was not being disruptive. This treatment of my sister is unconscionable of them!",-1

Ever single gate agent chose to harass me about the size of my bag and not being a personal item, despite it fitting in the bin 3x times for every agent that checked. Despite this, they have no system for marking a bag acceptable and because of this I had to tear my bag apart 3x times or pay $100? The stress and hassle from this experience, after 3x connecting flights (spanning 24hrs in the airport) was ridiculous. I will make it a point to never, ever fly Spirit again (even if my life depended on it).",-1

I followed all the proper advice I was given to file a claim, and now I'm getting the run-around and was told 3 different things from the customer service number (1-855-728-3555), the baggage claim number (16789732402) and the ticket agents at the Indianapolis airport. I am out hundreds of dollars and I got terrible customer service over the phone. I will never fly Spirit Airlines ever again, I hope someone who cares gets this and can rectify the situation.",-1

Before flying with them, I made certain my carry-on was within Spirit’s 18 x 14 x 3 size requirements. I took a bag this size. When I got to the gate, I was told pay $99 or I can't take it on. I had to pay. They made no attempt to measure or weight it. I objected immediately, but it was time to board, so I handed the agent my card. The charge was $99. Once on board, our in-flight the flight attendant said I just needed to send pictures to prove the bag size and they (Spirit) will take care of me. Once I arrived home, I took photos of the height, width and depth with rulers clearly in frame to prove the bag size. So far, I have contacted Spirit repeatedly, followed their directions to protest the charge. Frankly, I have found Spirit nearly impossible to deal with. I have tried everything with Spirit, followed their protocol in stating my situation (repeatedly), taken photos of the bag in question proving its size fits within their requirements. They had only responded with auto-generated letters, not addressing the issue other than to send the size requirements — over and over. This continued until today when I was told I had to go through chat. I stated my case, sent the photos, and Spirit responded by calling me a liar, (see attached) stating my bag is not 18 x 14 x 8. Spirit declined to refund of offer credit because of their policy of letting gate per4sonnel make the call. With no rulers or way to measure. They were wrong, they cheated me out of $99, but accepted no responsibility, even after I sent photographic proof the bag was the correct size.",-1

First of all, the flight was delayed more than an hour. The gate supposed to be closed at 7:30 pm and it opened around 8:30-9 pm. I had a small backpack and a small handbag. There were lots of people with backpacks larger than mine. They told me that I have to pay either for backpack or handbag. I asked them to put them together. They said the flight is delayed and they don't have time to wait for it. Even if I do, it should fit their standard size which mine will not do (how would they know when I haven't done it?) They were so rude and disrespectful. They charged me $100 for a handbag. When I was getting back from Orlando to Louisville, I put my handbag inside of my backpack and I had all same stuff compared to travelling there. The agent saw my backpack and checked it and it was fine! Therefore, it they would have given me time to put them together, there were nothing wrong with my personal item! When I got back, I sent email to Spirit and explained situation and their agents' rude behaviors. After several emails, they still claim that their agents did the right job!",-1

What about larger taller people on the plane? This is creating a hostile environment and people are showing it, just look at the news. We are being made to look like the bad guys when we complain of this injustice from their actions from greed. I paid for my seat and my daughter’s, the man next to her was taking up part of her seat because he didn’t fit in that space. That is not my fault or my problem but the airlines have made it my problem. It’s pretty sad when their pilots come on and ask people not to not fight because of the irritability it’s causing, explaining to people if you’re at the window you get the window and one armrest if you’re at the aisle, you get the aisle and one armrest if you’re in the middle, you get both armrests. Needless to say when my daughter was in the middle, she did not get both armrests. Then have even gone as far as placing a piece of platter over a piece of plastic that isn’t even the width of my finger nail and the seats do not recline.",-1

He just kept pointing at it rudely. When I tried to check in with my given confirmation number, my information, wasn't providing relevant flight data, so it printed up as me not having a flight/being at the wrong airport. I went back to the counter to speak to yet another rude representative. He said I was going to be charged $25 to use his services. He quickly found my flight information! I asked as to why I would be charged and he said ""Since you don't understand."" He took my bag and apologized for the ""miscommunication"", only after I told him not to speak to me like that. When I arrived in Orlando, my bag did not arrive. My bag never even left Charlotte. I spent the night and an entire day in Orlando on a work trip, with no clothes.

Unfortunately my wife caught Covid shortly before it was time to leave. We paid for flight insurance in the event something like this occurred. I looked up the qualifications for a full refund and Covid was one of the those reasons. When I called in to give the news and collect my refund, I was rerouted to Expedia where we booked the flight. I spoke to someone at Expedia and they told me no, Spirit is responsible for refunds. So I called back again. Same result. I went back and fourth 3 times before I got fed up and asked to speak to somebody hire up at Spirit. I explained to them that no one is accepting responsibility for who’s in charge of giving the refunds and finally the supervisor agreed that they were. Went through the whole process for getting a refund. And even had a confirmation email stating that we will be refunded within a certain period of time. A couple months went by and I asked my wife if she ever received the refund. She said no. So I called back. And the person I was speaking with said oh your refund was converted over to a credit instead. I asked why. And they said because Covid was not grounds for a refund. I double checked the websites refund policy again and sure enough I was right. Also I asked why wasn’t another email sent out to us informing us that they converted it to a credit? Now a year later I try to claim my credit for my wife’s birthday and they tell me it expired 90 days after. How does a credit of my money expire?.",-1

This time around I just needed a one way ticket since I was driving a U-haul up and flying back. I've done this many times with a round trip ticket, but this time I inadvertently click the flight in the wrong order so a ticket from MCO to Indy instead of the other way around. I got on their website and tried to see if there was a remedy of changing the flight. To my dismay they refunded the fare price of $49 as a credit for a future flight that has to be completed within 90 days but did not refund the upgraded seat that cost $100. I realize that if you read the fine print this is what your agree to however, they will sell that seat again and will be out nothing. This flight is 11 days away and it seems to be a very egregious way to treat customers, especially if you want repeat business. I booked a new flight with another carrier and hope to never cross paths with Spirit again.",-1

The flights are cheap but wait till you have to pay $200 to check in two bags one a carry on and the other a checked bag. Not only that but on other airlines such as Delta and American it’s only $30 per bag and you get free drinks and snacks unlike spirit where you have to pay $4 for water. In the end it’s worth paying the extra $40-50 for American or delta . Finally every single flight that I have had with Spirit has also been delayed by 45 minutes to and hour and a half.,-1

Money was not refundable, upon calling the airline to explain, I said at least I will have more space on my way back home (you know how uncomfortable this airline seats are). The lady from the airline told me that I had to move because this seat was taken by someone else, I ask who and she said my son name. I said I know but he is not coming, she reply that in that case the seat was going to be given to someone else. I ask for my money back in that case and she told me no. Never flying Spirit again.

After a 5 hour delay for “weather”, we all get rushed on the plane then told to get off because the aircraft was not able to fly due to damage from the last flight. Their airplane sat there for 3 hours and never once was checked by crew members. Then they proceeded to cancel our flight tonight! No reimbursement, no hotel offer, no rental car offer.

Missed my flight to Oakland due to delays, customer service was unable to refund any cost. Understandable, I booked another ticket from LAX and asked if any credit could be transferred. I was refused this request and had to pay an extra premium to take that flight with increased Uber costs as well. On my way back to SNA I did not receive any email/text notifications that my return flight for my round trip has been cancelled. Was told at the check-in desk that was simply ""standard procedure"". Almost missed my flight home but luckily scrambled to the gate. Was told that if I booked a check-in bag on my previous booking I was allowed to take my luggage onto the plane. As I was about to enter a lady walked by and refused to let me onto the plane as I did not check the bag. Did not offer to listen to my explanations at all and forced me to pay an extra 99 dollars and once again told me it's not her problem and it's ""standard procedure"". Told me if I had a problem then go get a refund request. I will never ride on any spirit airline flights for the rest of my life and neither should you.",-1

I was booked to fly from Charlotte, North Carolina to Sacramento, CA with a layover in Las Vegas. I was emailed that the flight to Las Vegas was cancelled at 5:45 am for a departure schedule for 8:52 am. Why an email? if Spirit is going cancel last minute, text the cancellation. So I arrive and learned when I tried to check my bags that my flight was cancelled and my only recourse was request a refund, well actually they did offer me the opportunity to book another if I choose that option they would have also give a $25 voucher. I wanted my money back. So I cancelled my reservation. Since it was a round trip flight I assumed that my cancelation for the flight there and back. However now I am getting emails asking me whether I want to check my bags and upgrade seat for the return trip. Spirit you never got to Sacramento, the return flight should have been cancelled when you didn't get me to Sacramento in the first place!

They kept delaying flight since 2:00pm till 9:00pm as they said they are waiting for Pilot to arrive and at last they said flight is canceled due to bad weather. Their reason was not at all valid. Didn’t give us any flight in 2 days as they didn’t have any seats available in any of the flights and they don’t give you other airline flights. Didn’t give us any hotel facility to spend the night had to be in airport for refund till 1:00am with kids. They just had one answer we can’t do anything. Outrageous customer service.,-1

You’d think you’re getting a deal with them because of how cheap the flights are but NO. You have to pay for almost every single bag you bring plus they have the most delays! I had a flight from Tn to Tx but I had to fly to Orlando first, my flight was delayed due to them having to clean the plane for over an hour! Then due to “needing to do paperwork”?!. Which caused me to miss my other flight back home to Texas! Then customer service was so rude! Saying “it was a miss communication” and putting us on a 10:35pm flight!

Later on I modified my flight they charged me $170 and they did not honor my purchase for the original booking. They charged me another $99 for my return flight, so be careful if you fly with this airline.",-1

The flight was delayed 9+ hours. Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. The gate agents provided very little information during the delay other than they were waiting on a pilot to come in off another flight. During the wait time, the pilot that did show up ""timed out"". Eventually the staff announced the flight would not leave until 5:15 am the next morning. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit's shenanigans. Vendors close early at Detroit Airport. For those of us that could not rebook a flight, no food vouchers were offered, no hotel vouchers offered and if you wanted to rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered (no other Airlines) forcing Spirt customers additional days of delays. When it came time fly out the following morning, a pilot was late causing a flight attendant to time out. In 9+ hours, Spirit couldn't get their stuff together even leave close to on time the next morning. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit's CEO, and Spirit's customer service agent was useless. Do not fly this airline! They do not deserve you! During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight and charged a $69 cancellation fee. I advised them to donate my credit to charity. I will not fly Spirit again. I advise you to reconsider Spirit in favour of an Airline that will treat you with respect. What a disgusting experience both with the flight and the very poor customer service.",-1

The staff was SO incredibly rude. From check in to boarding, the customer service was abysmal. Our reservation had a carry on and checked bag. At check in, the attendants were determined to make our lives hell. We spent $90 per bag to check in. The attendant told us we could have saved money if we vacuum sealed our clothes inside our bags, and she plans to make a TikTok of tips and tricks to save money on spirit.  Then the same attendants were at boarding. They made me zone 1 and my friend’s ticket zone 4, after we spent $180 to bring our bags with us, and checked in together on the same reservation. We didn’t realize this when we started to board. They allowed some people on one reservation board together, but not us! They pulled my friend out of the line then told her she would need to spend $100 more if she didn’t put her wristlet inside her carry on. While that happened, they told me I wasn’t allowed to wait for her. You think you’re getting a deal. Some info they don’t tell you- a checked bag is 40 lbs, not the usual 50. A carry on is $80 and a checked bag is $89. It is $20 minimum to secure a seat. Extra charge to use the Wi-Fi. No TV’s. No leg room (and I’m 5 feet tall). Never again. I’d rather walk.",-1

My flights was delayed due to the pilot been tired so we had to wait for 4 hours until another pilot can take the flight. I know that some airlines give you a voucher for meals when this happen the lady on the front told me to call the airline and ask for it and when I call they told me that they don't provide it if is because a weather delay but on the phone they said one thing and in the desk said because the pilot was tired but anyways they didn't give us anything. I have to much to say about the bad service when we were seat already at the airplane they make me change seats because they had to put a wheel chair in my seats I had to leave my three sons alone in the back but the way they ask me for it was very rude. So I will never used this airline anymore. I preferred pay more for a good service. Very bad and horrible service.,-1

2023-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Ft Lauderdale,,,,,,,1.0,"no flights, no service and no help",True,"  The booking date is 6/27/2023. We were thinking of changing the travel plan but we were not sure. So, on 7/12/2023, one of us used the spirit app to check the terms and payment deduction detail of cancellation because we want to decide whether to cancel or change or just keep it in order protect my benefits. In the app, she clicked the button ""modify my trip"", i.e., cancel or change my trip. It then led her to the cancel button. But she didn't expect after clicking this, the app switched to the website and after uploading a while it cancelled my flights directly and automatically without providing us with the terms and results and the payment detail. Then it led her back to my app, our trip information is all gone. And after the system cancelled our reservation without getting our permission, later the spirit sent an email to Jingyao Li who paid the tickets with a form of money deduction detail and a 10-dollar voucher. How dare they to do this without mentioning us about the fee detail and results in the app and when it switched to the cancellation processing on the website. We have spent 394.54 dollars, but in the end, we are forced to be given a 10-dollar voucher for future Spirit trip. If we were informed that we cannot get refund and the payment detail of cancellation when clicking the button in the app, we would have not used to app to click it. The Spirit company has the obligation to notice the customers about the fee detail and terms agreement option when they click cancel button to let them know the detail not just cancelling directly and automatically without customer's permission. Besides, there are three of us. The app didn't provide us with the chance to decide whether to keep it or more changes but directly switched to the website and cancelled all of our reservation. It was crazy and unbelievable. we tried hard immediately to contact with the staff, but they said the website showed flights were cancelled and they can do nothing for us. So, what's the point of asking the staff for help if everything the company relies on is the non-customer friendly website and tricky app. Due to their refusal of any help about our case, we have to rebook and reschedule our trip. Our request is that Spirit gives us full refunds of this payment fee $394.54. We were very disappointed because we got nothing, no flights, no service and no help. They used their system bug to try to pass the buck and got our money. We have nerve seen such an unreliable airline company.",-1
2023-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to St. Louis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit could not get me home,False,"  Spirit Airlines canceled my flight home from Las Vegas to STL 20 minutes before we were supposed to depart. After paying $303 for my luggage ($89 for a carry on, $89 + $178 for a checked bag over 40lbs.), I waited hours for my flight only to be canceled just a few minutes before. At the ticket counter, after waiting an hour, they could not get me a flight to St. Louis for two days! Also, I would not be accommodated for these two days meaning no hotel, food, or car reimbursement. The only thing they did for me was switch my flight to Chicago (not even close to my destination) and that flight was still the next day and, again, was not my destination. Spirit could not get me home even though that’s what I paid for. I spent almost 24 hours at the Vegas airport, had to go through security three times, and pay $550 total in baggage fees. I’ve never had such a horrible experience with any airline in my life. Please, do not fly with Spirit. It is simply not worth it. I am an inner city, tier-1, art teacher who works two jobs and barely makes enough to pay rent. These baggage costs and inconveniences are a huge expense for me. Not only was I disheartened, I felt like I was completely and utterly scammed. I also felt like there was absolutely no care taken in trying to get each passenger an alternative flight. I mean, I won’t even be making it back home to STL. I’ll be in Chicago. Then it’s on me to find a way home.",-1

Waited in a “self service” bag check in for 30 min. Get to counter, could not check minor bag here, told to go to ticket agent. Wait again 30 minutes, get to front and an agent yells out last call for Orlando, anyone going to Orlando? So I yell yep and step out of line with my family (again this is simply to check in one paid for bag for a minor). A new line evidently forms for Orlando and everyone from the back gets to the front of this line. I’m standing there, confused and annoyed because now the agent is telling me I have to go to the end of the new “Orlando” line. I said I’ve waited in two lines already and the agent said “You can’t just butt in front of everyone” and so humiliating! I said oh no, I waited in this line all the way up. As I stood there, a different agent letting other people go in front of us, and we are now bumping up against our boarding. I told the agent “we are going to miss our flight” and he said “all of these people are going to Orlando as well, you have to get in this line at the end.” My husband took over as I was about to pull a full blown scene.

But sometimes people want to make their own rules and that why is a lots of issues with this airline! No airline is perfect! All of them got meltdowns! The only different sometimes is the compensation! But can anybody expect a great compensation when paying sometimes as low as 25 dollars each way? As course not!

They were very rude throughout the whole process. A couple from our flight was not allowed to board the plane because the wife got frustrated and started yelling at the lady who was very rude to her. I will never fly Spirit airlines. Pls if you dont want to get scammed, dont fly with this airline. You are better off paying a little more for a ticket because in the end, when all their charges add up for every little thing they can think of, you will end up paying more and the customer service sucks.",-1
2023-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Ft Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,additional $90 because my bag was 45 lbs,False,"  This is a warning to anyone tempted by the low fairs Spirit Airlines offer.  You pay an initial low fare, but the additional fees for everything will make the flight much more expensive than taking another airline. If your bag is a couple pounds over 40 lbs, $90 extra. Do you want to make sure your family sits together? $15 additional per seat. We paid around $200 for our checked luggage, then had to pay an additional $90 because my bag was 45 lbs. Their max is 40. Lines took forever and we got stuck in security. We made it to the gate while the door was still opened, but they shut it with us standing there boarding passes in hand. They didn't care. ""Sorry, you'll have to rebook"". No more available flights to Ft. Lauderdale that day which means we were going to miss our cruise ship. Meanwhile, our luggage was on the plane without us on it's way to Ft. Lauderdale. Thanks to Southwest, we found a flight to make our ship, but we couldn't get anyone from Spirit on the phone in Ft. Lauderdale to see about getting our luggage which was only 30 minutes away from the port. No one answered, no one cared. We made our cruise, but without our luggage. I contacted Spirit Airlines when we got back and explained the situation.",-1
2023-07-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Most horrible airline ever,True,"  3 friends and I planned to fly from Boston to Santo Domingo on June 22nd via Orlando and had the most horrible experience. Flight NK2086 from Boston to Orlando was delayed by about 2 hours, and although we asked ground staff and stewards on the plane to communicate with the plane in Orlando so they could wait for us, they ignored our requests. When we landed in Orlando and got out of the plane (after it was delayed another 20 or so minutes because the gate was occupied), I heard an announcement that boarding would close for the SDQ flight in 1 minute. I sprinted to the next gate followed by at least 8 others trying to make our connection, only to find the ground staff at the gate to close the door as we arrived. We were then told to go to the counter to rebook our flight. It was at least a 1hr wait in line because there were so many stranded Spirit passengers from various flights, and by the time it was our turn, the alternative flight we had seen online was already full. The staff told the 4 of us we were already rebooked for the same flight the next day, meaning a 24 hour wait. Since we didn't have that time and didn't want to be stuck at the airport for 24 hours, we asked to be refunded for the missed flight and our bag fees. I asked if they would cover our hotel (and potentially meals) since we would have to stay overnight at the airport (especially if we would have gone with the offered alternative of waiting 24 hrs). They said no, I asked if we should sleep on the ground and they said yes. We ended up booking a flight with a different carrier that left early morning, still forcing us to spend the night at the airport and no sleep. Plus losing a night at the AirBnB that I paid for in Santo Domingo. Besides this horrible customer service and no compensation for the whole situation, on the way back it got worse. One of my 3 friends already planned to go back to Boston on Tuesday June 27 instead of Thursday June 29, but with the same flights. When he arrived at the airport, he found that the staff had canceled the entire rest of the reservation instead of just the one leg of flight we missed. Even though he had his flights in the Spirit app in his itinerary the entire time up to when he got to the airport. So he ended up being stuck at the airport for another night and having to book at his own expense another flight (very expensive last minute), and it took him a total of 2,5 days to make it back to Boston. The rest of us didn't want to be in this situation and ended up booking another flight since we didn't trust the app, because it had still shown the reservation for him as well. When confronting Spirit about all of this mess and the extra costs incurred, they took zero accountability for the lack of communication between flights. They refunded a small amount for the missed flight on the way there and gave some travel credit (why would I ever fly with them again), but not for bags ($100 each way!), or any of the expenses incurred with booking new flights, missed time and food/lodging. Most horrible airline ever.",-1

No issue. Bur after flight take off, no response from the air hostess. However the male crew was bringing ordered food. Then i told him which was after half an hour take off. Then he arranged cup of water through air hostess. By travelling in Spirit Airlines, even the basic need for water in a cup is denied. . Even after paying 30 dollars for checked in luggage, we were asked to carry the luggage despite our difficulty in carrying it. What is the purpose of collecting baggage charges. Does Spirit airlines has a motive to harass the customers. It is not the cheapest fare alone matters, a minimum travel comfort and courtesy is expected.",-1

No real time flight updates throughout the wait. I’m still not sure what the issue was, what I pieced together was we had to wait on another group of people that were late due to international travel then customs. But we should not have to wait. Accommodations should be provided to that group. On top of that since this airline don’t offer anything Free- we should have at least been offered a Free drink of water & snack at least. But nothing.

Flight info was changed about 5 times in the month before the actual trip which meant having to change my shuttle info from Augusta, GA to Atlanta airport. Atlanta flight was delayed so many hours that I almost missed my flight to San Jose, Costa Rica. I'm 64 yrs old running a full on sprint from Gate 4 to Gate 14, as I hear my name being called over the loud speaker. (And my gate info had been changed to Gate 13 which was incorrect. Flight home was delayed so late that I missed the shuttle from Atlanta to Augusta and lucky for me, the lady sitting next to me with her son, was supposed to be on the same shuttle to Augusta. She had already called her daughter to drive to Atlanta and pick her up. Atl airport is 2 1/2-3 hours from Augusta, she said I could tag along. I was so grateful, I would have had to spend the night in the Atlanta airport, it is after midnight at this time. Last shuttle pick up is 12:00 midnight. My daughter drove from Augusta to meet me about an hour away where they dropped me off. So the shuttle service doesn't give a refund, only a credit to be used within the year. Well, I rarely travel, this was the first flight I had taken in 20 yrs., so I am just out that $70.00. I will never fly Spirit again!",-1

The plane left over 21 minutes earlier than scheduled. She was given replacement tickets, but leaving from Atlantic City instead. She spent the entire night awake at Airport with cats. In a.m. she spent $168.03 on Uber to travel to Atlantic city Airport. When arriving in Phoenix (she had change in Orlando fla.), her 1 piece of luggage that she paid $110 for was lost. She lost the 2 hour ride from my friend because of schedule change. The shuttle doesn't allow cats. She paid another 2 hour Uber ride of $153.56 to get to my home. On her return date, 8 days later, she still hadn't received luggage even though they found it 3 days prior. She requested a refund or re-schedule for return flight (without cats) because she refused to travel without receiving her luggage first. It was refused unless she paid a fee costing MORE than the ticket. The luggage arrived 1 hour 50 minutes prior to departure and I live 2 hours away. They labeled her a ""no-show"", but it was her luggage that was the ""no-show"". She now lost her return ride and incurred a shuttle cost of $50. She had to purchase return ticket with Frontier plus baggage cost. There were many other unnecessary costs due to lost luggage, one example being that she had to pay out of pocket for virtual Dr. visit for emergency script of meds that she was becoming ill to be without. Her Spirit tickets cost $591.36, Uber $321.59, Shuttle $50 etc., etc., etc. Needless to say, she has been ill, overwhelmed, disoriented without clothing changes, meds, and many many other hurdles caused by Spirit. She was traveling to AZ to prep food, hor’dourves, transport necessities and set up at a location for my recently deceased son’s Memorial. I was too ill and was depending on her help. The day was ruined because of complications from this airline. I cannot ever retrieve this day and do-over.",-1

The general law requires that all airlines abide by the same rule which says that if you book a ticket and wish to cancel within 24 hours, you are permitted by law to do so without any cancellation fees or charges. They gave me a credit of $149 out of a $354 ticket that I bought and canceled in less than 4 hours.",-1

I had flight in June from BNA to Cancun and from there to another country. I didn't see my bag there and then I went to ask their agent and they filed a claim and told me that I will get my bag in my destination and they confirmed the bag was still in BNA. I went to my destination and spent my vacation and on my return I called them they told me that they don't know about the bag while I got email that they found the bag and they are transferring it to me, I called the agent again and she said the bag was transferred 2 days after my arrival to Cancun and she said I need to go to Cancun to claim my bag. Does this make any sense to anyone to go for your bag to a 3rd country to receive it? and they said they called me and sent my voice message. I didn't get any call from them.",-1

They advertise being affordable, and then you have to pay $90 for each check-in bag, and $90 for any carry-on. Absolutely ridiculous, and they are a total scam. I also saw someone in the airport be denied entry into the flight because the “personal luggage” that they had approved when he checked in was being deemed as too large. They weren’t letting him into the flight and said he needed to pay $90 to make it a “carry-on”. He went to speak to a manager, and after taking their time and delaying the flight for 45 mins, they expedited the process and quickly shut the doors, and left him behind. Then, after paying all that money, my bag is left behind. I’m livid. Additionally, I’ve never been on some uncomfortable seats in an airplane ever.  I really don’t know how this airline is still standing. They definitely should be shut down.",-1

I planned a round trip to Chicago Illinois, and my first flight was cancelled 20 min before boarding time. I had to get a refund and scramble to find a flight the same day.

They separate their flights by classes and majority of the flights are classes which are ineligible for my voucher. The voucher also only covers part of the flight. They breakdown the flight price by basic fare, taxes, and fees. The voucher only covers the basic fare which is only 70% of the price of the flight.

2023-06-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,"  I will never fly this airline again. I had a death in the family and I called customer service in order to credit my ticket to a future flight. I called first to move my flight and was told that they could not move the flight to the date to a future date and they did not fly to the destination where the Funeral was. They never issued a credit but was told they was a possibility to help because of the death of a family member and I could forgo the chat feature in the App. Yes, I was speaking with someone that told me to text someone else through the app. That’s what I call great customer service. So, I did. During the text chat I explained the death of my family member and they gave their condolences and ask me to send over either a link to the Obituary, the actual Obituary, a death certificate or a doctor’s note. The one I sent was the link to the obituary since the others would take time. It took all of 30 seconds to tell me that I did not meet the policy. I didn’t understand and I asked what did the mean? They said that I bought the ticket after he had died and I explained that I had not yet received word that my family member had died and I was out of the country when I made the reservation and got the word the following morning. Needless to say I didn’t have the patience to text back and forth and explain myself and I asked again can I just receive a credit, i’m not trying to get away with anything, I just want to go to a funeral. So, instead of wasting the dollars that I had spent to go to waste. I decided to fly through MCO and fly to my final destination, where the funeral was. I confirmed my flight and checked in and headed to the airport while reading what I can take onboard with me as a personal item. I have a over night carry on briefcase. On the website it strictly dictates backpack, briefcase, purses, etc; as I walk into the area at the FLL security checkpoint. I am stopped and asked to fit my bag in a make shift square which fit but the wheels prevented the bag going clean through meanwhile there were backpacks people were carrying twice the size of my briefcase. I really don’t get this policy if you cannot enforce all sizes of back fitting in that same square. I paid the $89 bag fee to fly onto my next connecting flight to my final destination to make it to the funeral which really is tomorrow but again because Spirit Airlines has no soul and a terrible policy in the event of a family members death.",-1

Waited 2:30 hours to get up to the terminal then we had to wait an additional 30 minutes to get off the plane. After departing went to check my bags only for them to be laid out on the floor and nobody informed us.

The flight was supposed to leave by 5:35 and we are still here, due to the plain needing gas, we board the plane at 4:40 and now is 7:30 and we still here.

Apparently not with Spirit Airlines Las Vegas. I was forced to put my beef jerky and gum into my flannel button pockets and stuff my thin bag into my backpack. On top of that the check-in people were bad. Hope it was worth it Spirit Airlines because you just lost a lifelong budget customer.",-1
2023-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Newark,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fly with this company again,True,"  I once enjoyed flying with Spirit a handful of years ago but more recently I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed in their service since giving them another shot. Yes the flights are less expensive than others listed but that doesn't include baggage fees and if you eat or drink on your flight. The amount paid for baggage on each flight (including our connection) is enough for another flight or 2, it's outrageous. They also damaged one of our bags and the whole handle to hold it and roll it along is broken off, who knows if they will actually provide a refund for that even though they claim to do so. We called to get that taken care of and were ignored. There were also no power outlets on any of our flights to charge any devices. I have never been more miserable flying than I have been with Spirit this time around. We will never fly with this company again and will encourage others to look elsewhere also.",-1

Almost 40 people in the Las Vegas airport missed their flights this morning and it’s crazy because they held us liable even though they have 2-3 people at the check in stations to service over 75-100 people that were in line.

This wait was 2 hours. Coming back, Friday 12am we leave on time at 6:45pm but couldn't get off the plane until there was an open gate.

2023-06-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to San Juan,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Next step is waiting for my full refund,False,"  This is a first for me writing a review as I’m very understanding of circumstances that are controllable and not controllable. I’ve worked in the Airline industry before actually as a Transportation manager for a catering company that actually serviced Spirit Airlines out of LAX. This was my 1st time actually flying on Spirit and I had my reservations about doing so, just based on the reputation but I placed my faith in believing my experience would be different. Yesterday I arrive at LAX for my flight to San Juan Puerto Rico about 2 hours prior to departure. I head to kiosk to print my boarding passes, and when I put in my confirmation #. I received a message that I’m checking in too early and my flight is scheduled to leave tomorrow - please see an agent. So then I must stand in this line to get to an agent for over an hour. I learned my connecting flight to Detroit was cancelled. When I finally got the counter the agent told me that my next flight out is in 2 days. My trip was from Monday to Friday now this issue has caused me to lose 3 days out of my trip and if I flew out Wednesday night I basically would turn right back around. I was looking forward to this 1st time trip to Puerto Rico but it looks like that has been delayed. The only options I had was to take the flight change or refund. Obviously I had to do the refund as I was losing on my reserved hotel room that I had for this 2 days, and honestly there was no way I was going to go through the nightmare of getting home. I cut my loses and then proceeded with a refund. As much as I had planned and anticipated the trip all the joy was lost. At the time I’m writing this I should have already landed and been taking in the island but since my vacation was canceled I returned back to work for a vacation I had planned for months. Next step is waiting for my full refund. When I initially purchased the tickets it wasn’t about the price of the ticket but the time of the flights that fit well with my schedule. Spirit mostly likely will not be that option for me in the future.",-1

My husband and I had the worst experience traveling back home to Orlando from Phoenix. The Spirit agents were very unprofessional in relaying to us and other passengers about our delayed flight. The team members all need frequent practical and developmental courses on how to deal with passengers whenever there is a situation involving delays and or flight cancelation. It was as if, passengers affected by these circumstances are not seen as important anymore. The agents and supervisors on schedule during that time were very pompous and inconsiderate towards the passengers being affected. I am greatly disappointed in the way we were treated by those agents working at that particular time and date. It is not my intention to travel with the Spirit Airlines anytime soon!",-1

I made check in, we passed TSA and 1 hour before boarding they cancel the flight. We have to comeback to terminal A, look for our luggage and try to get help, it took us 1 hour of standing in line for help. Then we got a fight to Atlantic City, we had to pay 300 dollars to get home. It was really bad, we have two kids and were very frustrated.

I have a flight at 12.30pm but delayed multiple times and finally to 6pm. After reaching Atlanta again delayed for 5 hours and then they cancelled the flight. When I went to them and talked. They said they are going give me the full refund. I waited in the airport until 5am and booked a new flight for 200$ on United Airlines. Reached IAD. I received mail from Spirit Airlines saying they are going to refund me only 45$. Initially for the full refund they sent me a receipt. Now they changed their mind and not given a single $ of a refund. I'm a student, I cannot afford more amount and i booked a ticket for 198$ for two way. Now my flight cancelled and i booked on more for 200$ . Total 400$ i paid. I haven't waited this many hours in airport in my life time. They wasted more than 12 hours of my time, my money, I don't even have a proper food and accomodation. The customer service is very worst. Their answers are rude, They are not even caring our pain and not even considering our words. I hate spirit airlines. Please people don't choose Spirit airlines.",-1

Waited (after checking in online) for hours in the line to drop our bags after going through the whole process of self checking our bags then had to wait the entire line anyway to drop the bags (felt like I was doing self checkout at Walmart only to have to wait in the line anyway). The people at the counter couldn’t have cared less how much of an inconvenience it was then about halfway through the line we were told to move aside to let a group through because they were in danger of missing their flight (no fault of ours but we got screwed again anyway). Finally got on the flight then while trying to leave Cabo we were told we were being delayed due to weather although all the other airlines were able to make their flights to the same airport go through. Now our flight that was supposed to leave at 3 now says it’s being delayed until after 9pm. It’s very obvious they’ve cancelled the flight and will be trying to cram us on the next one which at that point will be over crowded and they’ll be asking people to catch the next one as usual. And all the while I’m on hold with “Spirit airlines customer service” if there even really is such a thing. Still waiting for a human to answer the phone.,-1

This is what's happened. An assistant next to to the kiosk spent 20 minutes to charge me for the luggage with an assistant of another associate, then told me to see an agent because kiosk will not check-in me. I spent 20-30 minutes on line (I was the 2nd customer) to wait for.my turn, then an agent spent another 20-25 minutes to tell me at the end that I'm late. This was ridiculous and ripoff, unacceptable service. I asked for a full refund so I could fly with other airline. They said: call customer service. So I did. After staying on hold for 15 minutes, I was told that the best they can do is to give a credit for about half the price I paid total.

No compensation it was business as usual. I booked a flight to Puerto Rico in advance a (Direct flight). 3 months later I find in my (email) they cancelled my flight. So I had to rebook with only connecting flights (layovers) offered. They made it seem like they were doing me a favor by rebooking on a layover flight. Nothing worst than an airline cancelling your flight and then being treated like they're doing you a favor. Then the only way to make a complaint is to write an email to their terrible non-existent customer service. The only way to talk to a Spirit agent is to book flights (to take your money). If they cancel your flight or cause you an inconvenience, then it's email. One-way customer service is not customer service. Now I know one of the reasons why Spirit has a bad reputation.",-1

In short, we paid extra for reserved seats, paid extra for a bag that was over 40 lbs, then ended up missing our flight by maybe seconds. No other flights would get us to our cruise in time. We saved our vacation by finding a Southwest flight that was half the price of Spirit, no extra charges and no delays. I'm now sitting in JetBlue's terminal (same company) and our flight home has been delayed three times so far pushing it back 4 hours. We're also traveling with a 9 year old. I can't warn you this strongly enough. Do not under any circumstances book Spirit or JetBlue! If you already have, it will be worth it to eat the cancelation expenses.",-1

I'm extremely angry, as I thought I was getting a good deal to find out It was a bait and switch. $89 per bag for only 40lbs and $69 per carry-on is just ridiculous.

I have photos with proof. They make up ways to try to get you to pay the extra fee. I keep saying I will never fly with them again, they keep giving reasons why I should make good on it.

Leaving SAT airport to BWI we were delayed over 3hrs due to “weather” but other flights were fine. Then after staying in Maryland for 6days leaving BWI and going back to SAT we are delayed again over 3hrs so flight was suppose to take off at 9pm it’s pushed to 1:13am. We choose them due to nonstop and picking seats since we have a 8yr old. Should of just spent the little extra for southwest and paid extra to board first to grab seats. Asked around and this is the normal of Spirit flights. Should of done my research better. And Spirit doesn’t off anything for flights being so delayed they don’t care at all. Do not fly Spirit.,-1

Unfortunately my flight in Vegas was delayed which caused an absolute nightmare. I ended up missing my connecting flight and having to rebook for a flight going out to Nashville the next morning. I was basically stuck in FLL for 11 hours with no access to my baggage (which had my daily breast cancer medication), no discount or hotel voucher and with miscommunication an agent cancelled my AM flight. I had to pay for my hotel and a different ticket with Southwest Airlines. There was no urgency or help from any spirit employee. Over the course of 5 days after landing in Nashville, I still had no baggage and no medication. I talked to over 10 agents on the phone about how important my baggage was and no one seemed to think it was a big deal. I paid a total of $392 for my baggage to arrive in Nashville and it took 5 days. They will not refund me my baggage costs or what I spent on a new airline or hotel. They gave me a $50 voucher, because that will surely help fight breast cancer and I will surely fly spirit again…. NOT! I knew it was a mistake booking flights with spirit in the beginning, but I didn’t know they would fully dehumanize me and handle this situation beyond the absolute worst. I am not one to leave reviews and can remain calm in bad situations, but this was a whole other level of frustration, disappointment and wasted money. Not only over charging someone fighting cancer but getting them their medications with no sense of care/urgency is disgusting.",-1

They get you by making the tickets the cheapest and overcharging for everything else. They told me my bag was too big to be a carry on so they made me pay an extra $100 and instead of checking it in under the plan they had me bring it on the plane anyways.

Unfortunately, the rest of the industry is reducing service levels to try to compete. Spirit's relationship with their customers reflects that deceptive approach. If you prebuy something like wifi, you might find the plane doesn't have it. And then getting a refund will be, of course, not easy. These guys can be ok if you go in eyes open.

2023-06-05,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,"San Antonio, TX to Norfolk, VA",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the entire experience left much to be desired,False,"  Disappointing Experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com. I recently booked a flight for my sound engineer on Spirit Airlines through Expedia.com, and unfortunately, the entire experience left much to be desired. I had planned a trip from San Antonio, Texas to Norfolk over the weekend, which involved four flights due to layovers. However, my disappointment began when Spirit Airlines abruptly canceled the trip on the day of departure at 5:30 am, citing a lack of staff. This lack of preparedness and consideration for their customers time and plans was extremely frustrating. One would expect that in such circumstances, the airline would provide a refund or alternative arrangements for affected passengers. Unfortunately, this was not the case for my return trip. Despite the cancellation being caused by Spirit Airlines, they refused to issue a refund. This kind of inflexibility and lack of accountability is certainly disappointing, especially during these trying times where every penny counts. One of the reasons I had chosen Spirit Airlines was its reputation for affordable fares, but the overall experience has made me question whether the potential savings are worth the frustration and inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of customer support and understanding from the airline only exacerbates the negative experience. Additionally, I want to express my dissatisfaction with Expedia.com, the platform through which I made the booking. While I understand that they act as a middleman between customers and airlines, I expected better assistance and support in such a situation. It would have been helpful if they had intervened on my behalf to secure a refund or explore alternative options. In conclusion, my experience with Spirit Airlines and Expedia.com was highly disappointing. The last-minute cancellation by Spirit Airlines due to staff shortages, coupled with their refusal to provide a refund for the return trip, demonstrates a lack of responsibility and customer-centric approach. I would caution others against booking flights with Spirit Airlines, and I hope that Expedia.com can improve their customer support and advocacy for their users in such situations.",-1
2023-06-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will not be flying with them again,True," On my way from Las Vegas to Portland. Spirit last minute cancelled my flight at the gate. They had been having internal IT issues and couldn’t get a flight out Friday June 2nd. They were unable to accommodate my flight until after my return from Portland which would have been pointless. I ended up thankfully booking with Alaska Airlines instead for the next morning. Then when flying home from Portland because I’m seated zone 3 the attendant charged my rolling bag which which is the same size as a duffel bag and charged me 100$. I said well are you going to take my bag to luggage and he said no now you can place on top in the cabinets. He gave me a look like I was an idiot and said man this has been our policy for 15 years, I told him my bag fit and your the first airline to charge to now be able to place my bag on top in the cabinet. This airline is a joke and I will not be flying with them again.",-1
2023-06-04,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Charlotte,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,5.0,1.0,I wish I had read reviews,True,"  I wish I had read reviews before purchasing a flight from Spirit Airlines. I thought I was getting a bargain on bringing my bike for $75 round trip. Turns out that was only one way, so it was actually $150 round trip, but that was just the beginning. After multiple gate and time changes, my return flight was cancelled at 2a. I stood in line for 2 plus hours with other people from a total of four cancelled flights. By 430a, I was rebooked on the earliest flight available, the red eye that night. I spent money on a Lyft back to the area of the city that I was familiar with, and was lucky enough by 8a to connect with a friend who let me charge my phone and laptop at their office so I could book a place to shower and nap. If my time itself is not included, I lost $350 on an AirBnB, Lyft rides and meals. If you value my time spent on this endeavor, and I do, add on another $240. Altogether taking a chance on Spirit Airlines cost me an extra $437 (paid for non-existent wifi access on return flight, bike return, extra meals, place to stay and cab/Lyft rides) out of pocket and another minimum $240 in opportunity costs. So not only did I not save money, I spent way more on this Spirit Airlines trip than booking my trip on American Airlines would have cost me. On a positive note, I interacted with over a dozen polite, cheerful and helpful employees of the airline. Two were obnoxiously rude and antagonistic, one so much so that because of her alone I would hesitate to fly with Spirit Airlines again. However they were so many other friendly and helpful employees that deserve a positive review. I hope good things come their way.",-1

I had to pay $89 for the small checked in bag (this I knew beforehand) and to my surprise another $99 for my carry on that I was charged at the gate because it was half (1/2) inch to large. Supposedly because it had to fit underneath the seat (which of course went on the top bag compartment). I explained to the lady that this was outrageous (half an inch) and she couldn’t care less. I also told her that I was never going to use Spirit again for any of my employees and she also couldn’t care less. Companies succeed or fail because of their employees. This company will never get my money nor my company’s again and I am in shock that because of half an inch this airline doesn’t care to loose business. I am extremely disappointed.,-1

I had to find another flight, spent the night at the airport (nightmare). While we were waiting inside the plane, someone asked to purchase water or if he could have a cup for water. The flight attendant said no. Then 10 min later one of the luggage crew people came and ask for a bottle of water and the flight attendant gave it to him.

We were supposed to leave Austin by 5:50am and arrive to NYC by 2:30pm. We were stuck in Austin for 5 hours before our flight took off. And then we missed our layover. They rebooked us to a flight that wouldn’t get us to NYC until 1:30am almost 12 hours later than our original booking. Which means the hotel we paid for already, that we would not be able to use today, would be money wasted. I’m explaining how inconveniencing to our travel, time and finances their mistakes were today we were told that all they could do is give us two $50 vouchers that expire in August. Why after a day of being told that my time, money and travel didn’t matter to them would I want to fly with them again. I tried to at least get my money back for the flights to cover the hotel cost we lost out on and they refused. Then I get my boarding passes and our seats aren’t together. Mind you, the two people in front of me asked if they could be moved to sit together and they were accommodated immediately. When explaining, kindly, what sort of day we’ve had due to spirit and asking if I could please sit with my husband and they refused to do it. After explaining that they just did it for the people in front of me, I was rudely denied with attitude and threatened to get kicked off of the plane and put on the next flight. I am so exhausted with dealing with such an unaccommodating and rude airline. Because of Spirit Airlines our very much needed getaway has started out so poorly and I have not felt cared for at all. I will never fly Spirit again and am just so sad with how I have been treated today. I am trying so hard to not let it ruin our trip. I am so discouraged.",-1

I’ve flown to Vegas on Spirit twice, the 1st time wasn’t too bad, on time, seats a little cramped but it’s a short flight, baggage did take over an hour to arrive, mean while my driver outside waiting & driving around & around. Everyone laughs or says good luck when I said I was flying Spirit. Baggage weight is lowered to 40 lbs, not typical 50 of other airlines, & $14.00 more for initial bag than say like Delta. They charge you $70.00 for your carry on,  my purse was free, my make up bag around 12 X 9 X 5 inches it was an additional $99.00! It would’ve fit under the seat in front of me with my purse. My flight from SLC to Vegas was $208.89 for a grand total of $37789. I did upgrade my seat and purchased Wi-Fi for grand total of 429.88 (I booked round trip my flight home on Delta was $128.90). So here’s my 2 cents to try and make someone else’s flight better Spirit! Train your customer service with suggestions & pleasantries instead of condescending attitude. Not a single employee was willing to help or find a way to help facilitate any issues. Stop nickel & dimeing, & hidden fees. The baggage fees are ridiculous.",-1

Not to mention the overpriced snacks and beverages for purchase during the flight. This isn’t even the worst part - their customer service is horrendous. I planned a one day trip to golf with business partners of mine, Spirit never even bothered to load my golf bag onto the plane. I was not given a reason as to why my only checked bag was not loaded. When I expressed my anger with their rep, he called the police on me. I had to cancel my tee time and was not given a refund (had to prepay for the holiday). Upon arriving to the airport to retrieve my bag they had flown overnight, and to check in for my return flight, I was told there was an unknown error while checking me in. I was not given a reason for the error, and the only option they gave me was to refund my return flight and that I should check with other airlines about getting a flight home as there was nothing else they could or would do for me.

She did not allow me to proceed and forced me to do it. I had to get everything out from my backpack as my passport, driver license and the phone with the App with boarding pass was inside. That is the way you treat people? I assume because the lady though I was stupid or ignorant as she talking to me in Spanish. As soon as I started talking to her in English, she changed her demeanor and kept silence when I told her in English that I can afford to pay the carrion on fee. I will never use this lousy airline.

2023-05-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Richmond,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Avoid them at all costs,True,"  I am a vibrant 78 year old woman and I have travelled internationally for most of my life so I am not easily intimidated by the challenges that air travel can involve. That said, I have never experienced a worse airline anywhere in the world and I strongly recommend that you pay whatever the cost to travel by any other airline but Spirit. I chose them to travel to Virginia from Texas because the flight times were convenient and my outgoing flights worked just as planned. My return flight experience was a total nightmare. The hub for Spirit is Ft. Lauderdale Fl. When I checked my luggage in Richmond, My bag was one pound over the 40 lb. limit and the Spirit representative told me i would have to remove and carry items to reduce the weight or pay for a second bag. That was only the beginning but it was the least of my problems. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale for my connecting flight to Austin, and right up to departure time the monitor at the gate said the flight was on time. At the time the flight was supposed to be boarding I asked the representative at the gate if I had missed an announcement of a delay and she said the flight was cancelled. There was nothing on the monitor to indicate the flight was not leaving. She was rude and unhelpful when I asked if there were later flights. I found a customer service desk for Spirit and the two women reps were chatting and ignored me for several minutes. When one of them checked on flights to Austin, she said my best option was to fly to Baltimore and connect to Austin there, getting me home at midnight instead of 6 pm. So I waited for 5 hours to fly to Baltimore and when I got there I found that the flight to Austin was not the same day. I had to spend the night. In Baltimore i asked a Spirit rep if they could recommend a hotel and she was rude and said I should have arranged that in Ft. Lauderdale. By this time it was midnight since the plane was late leaving Ft. Lauderdale. A woman in baggage claim helped me identify a hotel and I spent $20 on a cab and $140 on a hotel. The next morning I flew to Austin and of course my luggage was lost. So by the time I got home, without my luggage I had been traveling for 26 hours for the flight that was supposed to take 5 hours with a layover. The Spirit employees main goal is to get you out of their face. I thought it was due to poor training, but I soon realized that they already know the system doesn't work to help their passengers so they don't even try. They just cop an attitude and tell you your out of luck. And if you call on the phone, the call center is somewhere where no-one speaks English. Not a coincidence. It is part of the system. This trip was the most expensive I have ever incurred flying to Richmond where my daughter lives. In the end for the cost of the tickets, the baggage fees, the seat fees and the hotel and cab fare, I spent more than $800. I could have flown 1st class on any other carrier for less. The stress and exhaustion of traveling for 26 hours and being treated horribly by every Spirit employee is something I can't describe other than as my worst nightmare. The Department of Transportation needs to do something to end the abusive practices of Spirit Airlines. They claim to be an economical airline but in fact they are a bait and switch business. Avoid them at all costs.",-1

Cheap, uncomfortable seats, ridiculously overpriced snacks and water bottles, additional charges for carry on bags and to choose your seat, and repeated delays with landing and taking off.

When we finally arrived to our destination, which was out of the country, my luggage was lost. I went my entire vacation without any of my luggage. I had to buy all new stuff and they still have not been able to find it to this day. I have called customer service over and over and they have no way to help me. they have no way to track the package and you cannot even get an update on the status of where your luggage is.

Then they had a time at 6.52pm for departure. I went to check in at 7:30 am day before check in… They had everyone boarded and doors closed. More then 10 people weren’t able to get on.

2023-05-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Nashville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst airline I've ever flown,False,"  Spirit is the worst airline I've ever flown on by far. They seem cheap but charge you a ton for both a carry on and checked bag, actually making it more expensive than a better airline. For a single flight from Nashville to Philadelphia we were delayed for 8 hours, got on the plane, were told by the crew that the flight was cancelled because they were late and couldn't get additional hours approved. Went to Spirit desk to get rebooked along with the rest of the plane and was told they wouldn't cover a hotel or any food (which is illegal) and then lied and said the reason they couldn't take off was weather related so they wouldn't be obligated to pay as that's ""an Act of God"" so we had to get our own food, Ubers and hotel which cost even more before going to our next flight they gave us (a worse flight too, no longer direct) with no reimbursement in any fashion. We even missed work because of this. That flight is also delayed in Orlando which resulted us not getting home until 3 in the morning with work the next day. There was even a fight at the gate which Spirit employees did nothing about! Don't even try to contact they're customer service either, they were all rude and unhelpful of they answered at all. When I told one of them Spirit's policy was breaking the law by not providing accommodations they said ""Yes, that is correct"". Which I promptly took a screenshot of. Not a single employee was willing to help or find a way to help escalate any of these issues to someone who could do something about it. The only recourse they give you is legal action. This is by far the worse experience I've ever had with not only a plane but a company in general.",-1

We had no choice but to accept the new conditions until we found a new, more suitable flight that was available. Next thing you know, it takes my friend 26 hours of chatting with an agent to change our flight to a more suitable one while getting told that it’s our fault for “accepting the new flight changes” when we had no other choice. Fast forward to our flight day, our departure was supposed to be at 8:45 pm with a layover of 44 minutes in Las Vegas. Our flight gets delayed to 9:17 pm but even with the new, delayed departure time, we don’t depart until almost 10:00 pm. Due to this delay, we miss our layover flight, getting rescheduled for 5 am the next morning and having to grab our luggage to check-in again. Take this from me please, no matter what trip you have, if you need to fly Spirit even once, you’re better off canceling the whole trip if you cannot find an alternative.",-1

Our flight was delayed 2 hours and we were told that our next flight would be delayed as well so we would still make it to our destination. When we made it to Orlando from Richmond, we were told our next flight to New Orleans had already left. None of the staff knew what they were talking about. They sent us on a wild goose chase to book our next flight. Not to mention our bags were lost as well. We waited 2 hours for our bags, we were given no hotel vouchers or anything and had to spend about 15 hours in the airport until our next flight took off. Absolutely ridiculous. Avoid using this airline at all costs. Spending the extra money for Delta is the way to go. At least you’ll know that you will be taken care of.",-1

My plane was due to depart at 9:40am that was pushed back til 1:30pm. My plane from Orlando to Baltimore left because I was still on the first flight. 8 hours later I'm still sitting in this airport.

The flight there was booked months in advance and then was cancelled 7 hours prior to the planes planned departure with no explanation, had to scramble to find a new flight last minute. Customer service wasn't helpful whatsoever. Finally got a plane down, on the way they lost our luggage. Then on our trip back, they held us in the airport for 8 hours, delayed the flight several times. We finally boarded the plane, waited another hour for them just to tell us the pilot couldn’t fly because she was over her 16 hour shift limit, and we had to de-board the plane. Gave us no hotel vouchers, no car rental vouchers, and left us stranded in the airport at midnight with no way home. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $150 and go Delta.",-1

Finally started taxiing at 1:20am, first because they were short staffed, and needed to wait for an attendant to show up, then no one to load luggage, and finally, no one to pull the plane to the runway. One passenger was escorted from the plane by police, and some other passengers left the flight on their own. Some of us have jobs, and families that we need to return to! And in compensation for the delay, all we were offered was a cup of water, a small pack of cookies, and dead cell phones? I've never dealt with an airline that was so poorly staffed and run.  I will say that it seemed it really wasn't the pilot, and the attendants crews fault at all. Hopefully they can find jobs at a real airline. If I could give the company a negative rating I would.",-1

When I arrived in Texas it was noticed that 2 of my wheels were missing off of my suitcase. Mind you, that this was only my 2nd time using the suitcase and because I couldn't provide proof of purchase , my claim was rejected. Their reasoning was that two wheels broken off was regular wear and tear!

2023-05-21,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Austin to Hartford via Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Horror story,True,"  I’ve flown spirit in the past and usually it’s an affordable easy way to fly which I have enjoyed up until my most recent flight on May 18th at 6:00pm MCO to BDL. We were sitting on the tarmac for 3 whole hours due to “Bad’ weather when it was perfect outside no clouds or anything. They made us deplane, so we had to go back to the gate. After this we are literally watching other flights take off the tarmac and we are very confused. There is no one at the front desks to help us. A flight attendant comes over and tells us there’s a mechanical failure and we will have to wait. Keep in mind all other airlines (DELTA,SW,ALLEGIANT,ETC.) have flights taking off from the Tarmac this entire time. Finally at 3am Is when the plane took off almost a 9-hour delay!  There were only 2 spirit agents helping 2 out of the 7 total spirit gates. Kids were starving as all places with food closed at 11pm. I missed a business deal worth 2k that same night due to this delay. 2 days later I received a voucher for $50. It is laughable. Next thing I did was give customer service a call to try and get a refund on the tickets. He says that the pilots, attendants, manager reported that it was only a “Brief weather delay”? This is far from the truth and simply a lie. You can ask anyone that was flying spirit that day at MCO after 6pm on May 18th. There was a weather delay for 2 hours. Next, we hear that there is a major mechanical issue with the plane from the spirit lady. 6 hours into the delay the pilots and attendants went home because they were over their hours. Next thing you know there are about 4-500 people communing around 6 spirit gates 7+ hours delayed for flights as there were no pilots or attendants to take us home. I want to like Spirit as I’ve flown with them in the past and it’s been good, but this makes me never want to fly or recommend to my friends/family ever again. I felt bad for the poor 2 ladies who had to endure the mess made by poor leadership and miscommunication. Horror story.",-1

2023-05-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Seriously the worst airline,True,"  Seriously the worst airline I've ever had to deal with. In November I had purchased tickets for my family to go on a vacation meeting up with other family. Spirit canceled our tickets without notification. We showed up to the airport looking like idiots when we weren't able to find our tickets using our confirmation number. Money was wasted on hotels, rental cars, and it was the last opportunity to see my family as I was very pregnant and usable to travel later. Then in February I decided to get one way tickets for my family as to give Spirit another chance however they were very rude at DTT airport and I was in a very long line. I arrived early and was instructed to go check in at the kiosks since we didn't have bags to check in, then they said i was unable to check in because I was ""late"" when I had been there with more than enough time to check in. I'm then instructed to go back in line to check in and by the time I make it to the front of the line I still had 30 minutes until my plane was due to depart. I was told the plane had already left but I was never notified that my plane was going to be leaving early. Then I was instructed to wait on the side to be rebooted. At this point it was 6am and I waited more than an hour to be helped, being told that they could rebook me for a 9:45 PM flight and pay $100 for each ticket. I then filed a claim with my bank to get my money back which I did until Spirit reversed the claim saying I never showed up and refused the use of their service. I then had to go directly through Spirit customer service. I got the run around and transferred to every department until someone finally told me to email them. It took then forever to respond. They asked for my flight details which I provided and it took them over a month to offer me a $50 voucher! The audacity. I will never fly or book or refer Spirit to anyone ever!",-1

We check in and the flight is delayed till 9:30. Nbd we will just get food and drinks then chill until boarding. An hour later it delays again, not we won't arrive in Florida till 11:30pm, & again it delays. We are now looking at arriving in Florida after 2am. Our short weekend trip got shorter than it already was. Finally, they cancelled it completely due to ""maintenance"". It took all that time to figure out that this flight wasn't going to leave to Florida at all? We are two single moms with two kids each and could not rebook due to already having made arrangements for our kids and our jobs. We were not able to do this again as it was already hard. We worked overtime at work to afford it and took a loss of 400$ due to no refunds for things we planned to do in Florida, rental card, other non refundable fees and deposits. Neither of us making over 1,700 a month so this was a big loss in our eyes and felt Spirit airlines was at fault and should accommodate for these things!",-1
2023-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft. Lauderdale to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the last time we fly with Spirit,True,  This is the last time we fly with Spirit and will ensure to let friends and family know not to fly with them as well. We arrived at the Denver airport over an hour before our flight was set to take off. We were told the gate was closed and were not allowed to check in our bags as they said they could no longer check us in. After telling us this the spirit employee at the ticket counter moved on to the next customer without even asking if they could help us get on to the next flight. We were left at the counter trying to find out next flight out without assistance from Spirit at all. We ended up taking a flight with United instead with zero reimbursement from Spirit even though they wouldn’t let us on. On our return trip we go the the ticket counter in Ft. Lauderdale to check our bag in and were informed that our bag weighed too much and needed to remove items otherwise would have to pay $99. After we took our bag off the scale was still showing there was weight on the scale when there was in fact nothing on it. We made sure there zeroed the scale before putting out bag back on and the guy rudely asked did you even take anything out of this bag you are still way over. I informed him yes we took a lot out and he said well there needs to be more taken out or it will be an additional $99. We again made him zero his scale and then we were allowed to check it in. Spirit airlines seems to try and get extra money from its passengers due to their scales being extremely far off and employees not really giving any concern about it. When we finally got to the gate there was a spirit employee who was rudely marking people with small bags check the size of their bags and if she didn’t like the way it fit she was charging them an additional $99 for a carrying on bag. She would make sure most women with purses were charged $99 for their purse if they couldn’t fit it in their personal item while allowing others to bring Fannie packs and other bags and not charging them. Once on board we were boarded late and then waited over an hour for the pilot to show up at all. Once he showed up they did not offer passengers any type of inflight beverage or snack for the inconvenience rather charged full price for these items. As some people missed a flight or had to book additional hotels because of the delay you would think spirit would have at least given complimentary beverage or snacks onboard to be considerate and compassionate to its customers,-1

We paid a premium to get her home at this time so that she can attend a doctor’s appointments on Monday, May 15th. She waited on the plane for 4 hours and nobody could give an explanation as to why they couldn’t take off. They finally exited the plane and we’re told that it’s “broken” and there’s a fuel issue. They said they would send a voucher for her to get something to eat. She never got it while waiting to see if the issue could get resolved. 5.5 hours later, finally stated that they’ll have to book her on a flight for tomorrow. They lost her luggage. She’s hysterically crying and now my wife is waiting for her at the airport for over an hour because they said that they’re “too busy” to look for it.

Not only my flight, but happened multiple other flights nearby my gate. My impression was, the worst flight I had in US.",-1
2023-05-13,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst airline experience,True,  Worst airline experience I've ever had. First flight broke down due to a broken fuel gauge. They made us drive 2 hours to the nearest airport to try to get on the next plane. We then sat in the next plane for over an hour after departure time. No communication from any staff in either experience. They denied passengers the chance to exit the delayed flight and refused to provide updates on any aspect of the flight. I would not wish this airline upon my worst enemy.,-1
2023-05-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst experience and disappointment,True,  Spirit Airlines is absolutely the worst airline. They switched my leaving times from Cancun 2 to 3 times then they delayed our flight 2-3 times when we had a 7 hour layover in Orlando. Then last minute switched our gate all the way over to the complete opposite side. I warn every person that is going to another state do not use Spirit airlines in anyway shape or form or you will be left with nothing but the worst experience and disappointment. Do not use This company. I paid for WiFi and they did not have WiFi available on either plane ride. Now I’m filling out forms to be reimbursed.,-1
2023-05-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,offered zero assistance,False," Our return flight got moved at least 4 times. Then we thought it was only delayed a couple hours but instead it was actually pushed up almost 24 hours so when we arrived at the airport we had missed our flight. We had to pay an extra $99 a person to get on the next flight (almost leaving the same time as or original flight so why was our flight changed?). I called the next day to complain and was told there was nothing they could do because we already paid the money - apparently they wanted us to be stuck in an airport instead and I couldn’t speak to a real person and needed to email customer support. Needless to say, customer support said too bad and offered zero assistance. Not to mention the plane on our flight home had ZERO room and sounded like it could fall out of the sky at any moment. Never flying Spirit again.",-1

There staff is untrained, unprofessional and it shows in their work. I've never had a problem with this airline until my last trip and they really ruined it for me. Not only do you have to put up with cramped seating, over priced snacks, they went above and beyond with completely ruining my luggage! Lied to me about there policy! Didn't care to help find or credit for a room after they were the reason we missed our connecting flight, and we paid for insurance!",-1
2023-05-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas via Reno,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Absolutely terrible,True," Absolutely terrible! Delayed our flight home by 2 hours. While arriving at baggage drop one hour and 45 min before departure, they refused to take our luggage and told us our flight was now leaving on time! We were told we could be switched to a flight that would be leaving in 2 days (ridiculous)! I in turn had to buy new tickets home that cost me $1,600! Now they are telling me that reimbursement is not an option because the flight was delayed due to weather conditions? We were never told of these weather conditions and the weather was beautiful!",-1
2023-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to San Juan,,,,,,,1.0,Do not fly Spirit,True,"  For almost 1 year I have been trying to obtain the cash refund as required by regulation for a cancelled flight. Never mind that after being delayed 5 hours due to weather and ultimately being on the aircraft only to be cancelled, the flight was still cancelled. The pilot apologized so many times - he was great. He said Spirit will try to tell us it is weather, but the weather had cleared hours earlier. The issue was no co-pilot, so at 2AM we drove 3 hours home and missed a wedding and had a bunch of unrefunable hotels. So why the issue with Spirit? A cancelled flight = refund. Not if you use a Visa Gift Card to pay. ""We can only refund to the form of payment used to purchase the ticket."" So, that's it? Because I paid ""wrong"" Spirit holds on to $574 and never has to return it? I have chatted, called, emailed and sent written letters. No response on the letters. Chat can't do anything. Email just says what the chat people say. The FAA has had this for almost 1 year. Lesson learned. Do not fly Spirit. They quite literally have stolen from me.",-1

After flying with this airline. I disagree on most things. First, the flight was great. The flight attendants were very nice, I felt well informed. Everything was on time. Now snack and drinks were expensive so on that side I agree with the reviews. The Wi-Fi was also rather expensive but those are minor things on a 4 hour flight. I brought my own snacks and had a movie downloaded. The seats are very small but I’m a big guy and was comfortable. So all in all I would totally fly Spirit again",1
2023-05-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Las Vegas,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,were the rudest people,False,"  Check in people for Spirit were the rudest people I have ever talked to. This was the worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with in my life. There were 2 agents and they both gave attitude when my friend asked for her plane ticket to be printed. I had printed my ticket at the kiosk so I thought, and when I got to security they told me it was just a receipt. I ran back upstairs and I asked if the kiosk even printed plane tickets and they said no. They let me leave knowing I didn’t have a plane ticket and told me I was going to miss my flight. They said it was my fault and I should have gone to them instead. The lady refused to print my ticket and folded her arms while she mocked me and proceeded to tell me she wasn’t going to print out my ticket and she was going to make me miss my flight. This entire time she kept rolling her eyes and laughing at me. I had to make it to Vegas for a funeral and I let her know I needed to make it and I could make it if she released the ticket and she refused until I had to literally beg, multiple times. While she was telling me I was for sure going to miss my flight, our flight wasn’t scheduled to take off for another hour. We sprinted through the airport and made it with 30 minutes to spare.",-1

2023-05-06,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Dallas,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,experience was a nightmare,True,"  Attendants are rude and unprofessional. They are also unable to communicate with passengers effectively. The airline also should be blamed for trying to cheat paying passengers by asking us to pay for carryon that won't fit into the crate. If it has a wheel of course it won't fit. When I turned it upside down it fitted but, our rude attendants stated it has to be side ways. If you don't want to pay take off the wheel or make it fit into the crate. I am just an employee following policy and the messenger. You can take your complaint to the corporate. The entire experience was a nightmare of paying additional $237 at the counter for carryon after only paying $80 for 2 big checked in bags.",-1

2023-05-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Seattle via Las Vegas,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never had an experience this bad,False,"  Flight ended up costing 5x what I originally paid due to my connecting flight being cancelled after a six hour delay. The plane was there but they didn't have a pilot to fly the plane. It was a Saturday night and Spirit informed me that my rescheduled flight would be on Wednesday (yes, 4 days later). My option was to be stranded in Las Vegas or find another flight. Spirit would not put me on another flight to Portland the next day (which was still a 3 hour drive from Seattle ending up costing me another $200), which meant another ticket. Total costs ended up being over $1,000 for what was originally about a $200 ticket. Spirit said they would refund me the fare from Las Vegas to Seattle which was less than $100, and they never did. I had to dispute that charge on my credit card. Never had an experience this bad in 30 years of traveling.",-1
2023-05-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Philadelphia via Ft. Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,3.0,a cheap airline in every sense of the word,False,"  Seats uncomfortable? Yes, definitely. Upgrading to exit row at least provided more leg room. Except flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Philadelphia, the exit seats have permanent armrests for each seat so you had to mold yourself into the seat which made it impossible to get comfortable. Only complaint about customer service is their definition of ""normal wear and tear"" on damaged luggage. One of the casters on my spinner suitcase (4 casters) was completely destroyed and broken off during the flight. Filed a claim through the website (which was very simple). However, response was that destroying the caster making the spinner suitcase totally useless was ""normal wear and tear"". The worst part is that there is no way to communicate back regarding the incident to ask for explanation or refute their conclusion. They are a cheap airline in every sense of the word.",-1

2023-05-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Cleveland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst travel experience I've ever had,True,"  My flight got ""diverted"" while I was in MID AIR due to a ""delay in weather"" coming from Fort Lauderdale, which I'm reading more and more now that it was due to not enough pilots to fly the plane. My flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta was originally scheduled at 1:35, which got pushed back to nearly 3:30. The return flight to Cleveland was 5:35. I was in the plane at 5:45 due to ""over head traffic"". Once I started growing concern about missing my flight, I then asked the flight attendants for help, her response was snarly and rudely stated "" you need to contact customer service or email them."" While still on the flight. Sprit then rebooked my flight for the following morning for free, thank you for that. I then stayed in the airport from 6pm-4am without being offered a hotel voucher. I wake up at 4:30 to check my bag only to be told I needed to pay an additional $89 for a bag that was already checked, twice for a total of $135. The first lady I encountered at the Atlanta airport Spirit help desk was extremely rude, and once I told her I already paid for the bag, she asked for aid from the supervisor with a nasty attitude. The manager walked over and simply said ""we don't see anything here, you need to pay $89 and then walked away."" After trying to show her that I paid TWICE for the bags from my bank accounts, she snapped and responded ""I don't care about that, it will be $89."" I asked to speak to her boss where she told me to contact customer service. As I walk out of the line on the phone, the other staff whispered under her voice ""get your ass out of here."" I got on the phone with the manager,  who then proceeded to tell me that since I booked through a 3rd party site and the ""weather"" there was nothing they could do. I stated that she was going to lose a customer and her response was ""we can not change the policy."" Unapologetic, nasty, and very unwelcoming was every single employee from that airline minus the gentlemen helping the kiosk area. The man was really nice and helpful with a great attitude. I will never fly this airline again, the employees are rude, demeaning and have no solutions to any of the questions that I had. This was the worst travel experience I've ever had, not because of the change in flights, but the customer service. Never again will Spirit Airlines receive another penny from a loyal customer who has been flying Spirit for years.",-1
2023-05-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,stranded in a connecting city,False, There were six canceled flights the same day mine was. I talked to one of the Spirit employees and they said that my cancellation was because flight attendants and pilots just weren’t showing up so they’re LYING and saying it’s weather so they don’t have to compensate people. I was rebooked and didn’t get the email until an hour after the flight left! They weren’t even going to rebook me because they said I missed my flight. I was then stranded in a connecting city with no food or hotel vouchers. I will NEVER fly with Spirit again.,-1
2023-05-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,now is a complete scam,False, First they said they’d be 1.5 hours delayed so my son got to the airport only to find out they left on time. He missed it and I had to buy another ticket through Delta so he wouldn’t miss out connecting flight to Cancun. On the way back his return flight was cancelled due to Spirit because they said if he misses the first flight the entire trip is void. Never heard that before. All in all this company used to be decent and now is a complete scam.,-1
2023-05-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ft Myers to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,never get another dollar from me,True,"  The worst. By the time I finished my flight it cost me almost $500 round trip. On my way home my bag was over weight. 44.5 lbs. That cost $80 additionally after I had already Paid $62 for that bag. Seats are like a wood bench no cushion. The women at the ticket counter who was very staunch about that extra 4lbs. Was also at the gate nailing everyone for extra money if their bag was 1 inch too big. Here is the sneaky thing about Spirit there carry on bag size is smaller then most other airlines. They are guaranteed that extra $100 for an oversized carry on. If you believe you are getting a good deal and want to keep the price point you were sold. Don't bring a bag. Sleazy, shady operation. Never again you lost a many customers today I watched all the people being penalized like me turn ghost white at the fees. I told all of them, (about a dozen or more) you must write a review. Again sleazy business practices. Spirit will never ever get another dollar from me. I will walk to Florida.",-1

I have had issues several times but the icing on Today was they called me notifying me that my baggage wouldn't arrive until 8 hours after me at my destination because I didn't re check it.

Flight delayed so long that my wife and I missed our connecting flight. Given the option of refund or flight 27 hours later. Treated rudely and with no compassion when asked for hotel or food vouchers. Staff at every point: in flight, at gate, at ticket counter, etc. Rude, bordering on abusive. Gouging everyone on luggage and carry on, even personal items. ""We're saying it was the weather"" was one response. Something needs to be done about this airline. I can only hope with all the complaints, Something will be done. They are simply horrible.",-1
2023-05-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,5.0,Spirit is a scam,True,"  I flew with Spirit 5 years ago but had no choice but to fly a few days ago. First I flew from DFW to Orlando, which the flight was extremely delayed (not due to weather.). I got to Orlando and the flight had departed already in mid-flight. I had to wait in the customer service line at the airport with 2 grumpy hungry kids one being an infant. I waited for almost 3 hours. When it was time to find a new flight they said they wouldn’t be able to book us until 2 days later because their flights were full. So the lady booked us with another airline (just as bad) I had to repay for my suitcases, which their suitcase charges are out of this world. Anyway long story short I called to get a refund and the lady on the phone was rude and didn’t know what her job was obviously. She told me that it was considered a no show so she can’t help me . I repeated myself numerous of times asking her to clarify how that was considered a no show because I didn’t fly from DFW to Florida on my own. She didn’t know what to say and just said this was part of our guidelines and policy. I told her to show me and she kept repeating the same thing over and over again. Yet going no where once again. I got extremely frustrated and I told her I wanted to speak to a manager she said there were almost 600 callers in queue so the wait was long. At this point I waited 4 hours to speak to someone so I thought what the heck another 4 hours. She hung up on me. Told me she couldn’t transfer me because I was speaking to my mom and telling her the case. Spirit is a scam and makes takes your money.",-1

Cheap is no good if they take you half way, cancel your return flight with no explanation, then offer your either and only half your cheap ticket price refund, or wait two days for a return flight.

To add to the horrible experience already. Flying home they charged us an extra 125 dollars for luggage that we already paid for. When flying out I asked the agent to check to see if my luggage was on the plane and she refused with a smile on her face. I have a feeling my luggage will never make it to my destination.

2023-04-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Columbus,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no security you will board your flight,True,"  I arrived 4 hours before my flight and all flights that were boarding were overbooked by Spirit so you had families and couples not able to get on the plane when they arrived 10 minutes before their flight took off as it was overbooked but spirit claimed the gates already closed to the customer. One passenger later on was upset and a spirit employee screamed back at him that if he doesn’t stop talking that she will cancel his flight and she then screamed cancelled, you don’t have a flight! Bye! For my flight - it was overbooked - and they only allowed 77 people who were booked for this flight to board (luckily I was one). Then in line to board we found out people have been stuck at Orlando airport since Wednesday and Friday trying to get home (it was Sunday now). Some said Spirit ran out of vouchers so they had to pay for transport, hotel and food out of pocket since Wednesday. One person said they wouldn’t reimburse all the upgrades she paid for on her previous flight (buying a big seat option and now she was out of luck and booked in a regular seat). These people were let on our flight to Columbus but the remaining people that were supposed to be flying to Columbus on Sunday who knows how long they were stuck at Orlando and how much extra money they spent on hotel and meals to return to the airport to find out they were still stuck in Orlando for another 2-3 days possibly? Seeing all of this really scared me to fly with Spirit again - tickets are the cheapest right now (probably because people don’t want to fly with them again) but to find out you won’t be going home for another 2-4 days and Spirit ran out of any vouchers and won’t compensate you being delayed. I got lucky this time but you’re rolling the dice every time you fly with spirit there is no security you will board your flight nor any idea when you’ll be able to get back home - booking a flight is not a reservation but an option bookmark that doesn’t guarantee you a flight at Spirit.",-1

My feeling was that they try to take as much money as they can from me It happens with me before, It is not the first time. It is the worst airline that I know.",-1

Our flight was canceled last minute, had to wait a full 24 hours to get to our destination and were not given a hotel or anything. Then we finally get to our destination and one of our checked bags was not put on the plane so now we're delayed even further trying to find our bag.

They change flights, don’t notify the customers while there sitting and just plan lazy and not dependable. I’ve flown from Newark to Dallas thinking the next time it will be better always the same , going to Newark from Dallas, Atlanta or Cleveland they are not dependable and your flight will be delayed at least twice.

In our case, they let us go at Seattle airport, then they force us to pay at Houston airport for the same size personal item! When we refused to pay, they cancel our flight. We refused to pay because it does not make any sense to us. Why they let us go from one gate and dont let us go at the other gate? We are now left in the airport waiting for next flight 2 days later if we want to fly together (6 of us). So frustrated and upset!",-1

We were supposed to leave Saturday and they said they didn’t have a flight until Monday. We had to cancel our flight then rebook with a different airline altogether. Paying an extra $400 per person. They blamed it on the department of transportation even though they were aware a month in advance of the projects that were being worked on. So there was “nothing they could do about it”.,-1

I should have known better with how ""cheap"" their flights are but this is ridiculous. Our flight just got canceled after 6 hours of it being delayed several times along with gate changes which were never announced. Now we have to get a hotel room for $250 just so we don't have to sleep on the airport floor. And Spirit's answer is ""We don't have to reimburse you or give you food vouchers because it's 'weather-related'. Our beachfront hotel in South Beach didn't cost that much. I could have spent that money and had a whole extra beach day and not spent all day in the airport! Amazing how the government has no rules and regulations to stop us from being treated this way. Not only am I out an entire day of vacation, I lost a day of work, along with all the extra baggage fees and overage fees (they only allow bags up to 40lbs and not 50). The customer service is appalling. I could go on and on but am too angry right now to relive this whole ordeal. Just don't fly with them. It's not worth it to save a few bucks. You're not really saving anyway once you pay for your seats and carry-on and checked in luggage. Worst airline ever along with Frontier.",-1

Lauderdale and Ft. Lauderdale to Houston. Not an issue but was rather upset I now had to buy an extra pair of seats. I purchased seats and bags for $311.20. Fast forward to last week, Ft. Lauderdale airport was closed due to recent flooding, so I changed back to my original flight. Apparently that flight was more expensive so I was not able to get a refund on my seats. Why in the world would spirit send me multiple emails to pre-purchase seats and bags? I spent an hour on hold for them to tell me that my original flight was more expensive. If this was the case, then why did they not reimburse me for the difference when they changed it to Ft. Lauderdale? I will never use Spirit and will never recommend it to anyone. Staff and attendants were extremely friendly and helpful. I will give credit where credit is due. I purchased the streaming wifi and it only worked for 1.5 hours of my trip. extremely frustrating.",-1

Our return flight home was OK, but the the flight there was put off by so many hours that we would have missed our connection flight in Fort Lauderdale. We had to buy very expensive tickets on another airline in order to get to our fully inclusive resort on time. Because of the travel delay we were given $200 (4 @ $50) vouchers for future travel with Spirit Airlines to be used by May 27. I have tried 4 times to use my vouchers. I changed dates, I changed times, but could not get the Spirit Web site to accept the vouchers. I read all the restrictions and set my dates accordingly, but no luck. I spent 5 hours today online with Spirit Chat only to be abruptly disconnected at the end. Three people actually chatted with me during this time and acted like they were going to help, but nothing happened. I now have vouchers that are useless. I wasted hours of my time, did not get help. They do not care at all about customers! I will not fly with Spirit again.",-1

I have flown my whole life and have never been robbed like this. I have carried on my bag every single flight all my life. On the flight there was gum stuck to the tray table. Adelay in Ft. Lauderdale kept us in the airport for 14 hours. Yes not in their control, but the ticket agent say too bad we can't help you get onto another flight. I had to demand a supervisor to get on standby. Why did I have to demand a supervisor from this agent to help me get on a flight the next morning? This airline is the worst experience I have ever had and I will never fly them again.",-1

It started with the excessive baggage fees of $70 per bag, and it only got worse after we checked in these bags and we went to board our connecting flight. Mind you we had no issue flying San Antonio Texas to Vegas but once we left Vegas to fly to Burbank, this horrible woman started pulling everyone out of the line literally talking to us like we were cattle and told us we had too many bags when we each that they allowed us to bring on the first flight but not the second they made us wait in line and literally pay 100 extra dollars per bag. It was horrendous so my friend and I ended up paying $400 extra dollars for bags when there was plenty of room on the aircraft, and it was only at the last minute when this woman started singling out people. The excessive fees were bad enough, but her attitude was unspeakable. We ordered coffee and a container of pretzels, and when they sat them down on the tray, they told us the fee for each person was $18 to which we said take it back. Horrible experience.",-1
2023-04-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I do not recommend flying Spirit Airlines!,True,"  My husband and I were traveling back home from MCO (Orlando) to DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth) on 04/01/23. We arrived early to the airport in Orlando. The Spirit Airline Gate was horrible. Lines out the door just to check-in your bags. By lines, I mean unorganized lines. Only one staff member ""guiding"" people. Why they don't have an automatic bag drop system here is beyond me. We arrived our at gate on time. Our flight was delayed 7 times (due to ""weather""), and our Gate Number also changed several times. Is like Spirit Airlines did not know what they were doing. The plane was there. We were told we were going to board, got in line to board, and nothing happened for 30 minutes,. My husband and I decided to go back to our seats. After another 30 minutes other people were wondering what was going on. First they said there were weather delays, then we see several staff members waiting at the gate (The Captain, Flight Attendants, etc.). No information is provided. Only one person at the gate counter who was useless. People had to go up and ask her what was going on. Apparently, now there was an issue with staff being able to fly that day. We wait more, and more. Then the flight is cancelled. We are told to head back to the ticket counter to get another flight, which means we had to pass the TSA gate, we would need to grab our checked bags. By the time we get there it is packed with other passengers. The next flight out is booked. The next available flight has connections. We decided to go with American Airlines to get out of Orlando. We ""slept"" in the Airport Food Court (the whole place full of other passengers sleeping in the benches). Spirit Airlines only offered $100.00 travel voucher/per person. Oh, and one $14.00 Food Voucher (LOL). It is not worth flying with this airline. They are not dependable. Their flights are usually delayed or cancelled. Their system is not organized either, they are not able to keep up with their flights, or even baggage. I will not be surprised if this airline is bought out by another company with better customer services. I do not recommend ever flying Spirit Airlines!",-1

Here are my takeaways: -The gentleman supposedly helping me was in fact occupied with many other things and was not really available to me until 1 hour into the text. He simply kept putting me off with responses like, ""I am working on it."" ""Thank you for your patience."" -I had to repeat my clearly articulated request to change my flight to a specific other flight at least 5 times. He kept asking me what I wanted to do and offering me solutions that were not related to my request. -The representative confused me with other customers multiple times offering me flights to places unrelated to my request. -The representative gave me false information multiple times, at one point telling me I couldn't make the change unless the passenger died. -Spirit Airlines offers the worst experience in flying (an opinion that is shared with anyone I speak with about your service). -I am done using your airline regardless of price difference.

To be more precise for a particular staff. Disrespectful, unprofessional and turning her back to the customers. I would never in my life want to meet or see her again. I was flying from Las Vegas to Milwaukee. First of all, nobody announces any information about the flight delay, because the pilot is simply missing. Second of all, the cabin crew is being unbelievably disrespectful once I ask her to be more quiet while having a random conversation with other cabin crew person. I was polite asking to do so in a very respectful way. I was told this: ‘we are talking so we don’t fall asleep’ I asked her once again to not make so much noise and just let me and my family rest. She tried to make fun of my wish and simply turned her back to me. I have never experienced that kind of a service worker behavior and I would never except or tolerate again. My only wish is, that this lady stops this behavior with the customers or learns how to communicate in a proper way.",-1

Layover #1 for 2 hours with no explanation. I had a connecting flight in Las Vegas, Nevada. Spirit airlines left me stranded in Las Vegas. Numerous delays, with no explanation! Then at the end of the day, The flight was cancelled! I followed all of the stranded people from that flight down to the ticketing area, which after a very long day already, was a very long walk for a Senior Citizen! They had all of us stand in a cattle line, with only 1 person at the counter, then added one more person to either get a partial refund , or schedule another flight with Spirit airlines, but not until Tuesday or Wednesday! I have never experienced this type of rudeness from Customer service for an airline. Given the choice, I would never fly with this airline again, and advise anyone not to take your life and chances with Spirit airlines! Not to mention that there were other people trying to catch their flights, so to find a place to sit down in the airport was impossible.",-1

Always used the same small bag size of a back pack. Rude agent came to me and yelled at me and another girl bc we also had a very small purse 4x6 and pulled us asking us to $99 for our extra bag. I said I’ll put my purse in my bag and she then made me measure my bag. It fit just has a long strap that poked out and wouldn’t let me on the plane unless I paid $99. She did the same to the other girl and even though our bags fit she made us pay. Mind you we already checked a carry on bag $89 and then they made me pay $99 at the gate for my bag that I never had a problem with before and it fit. She was rude and she was yelling. The other agents apologized while they were scanning our passes. Worst experience and will never fly with spirit again.,-1

We boarded the plane and then we were told the flight was cancelled, with little to no information on next steps. The next available flight to our original destination was not until 3 days afterwards. We waited several hours to reclaim our baggage, and the staff was unable to provide any updates on the situation during this time. Staff members, including the supervisor, were very rude and dismissive of customer concerns. Response time for complaints filed through their website are 30 days and they have done nothing to rectify the situation. I will never be flying on Spirit Airlines again and would not recommend that anyone else does. They display “cheaper” rates on their website, but have hidden charges such as seat selection, carry-ons, and even tried to charge us additional fees to tag our bags, despite their kiosks not working.",-1

My day was great until I got to the airport and decided to volunteer my seat. I was flying back to New Jersey. I just want to say to the public DO NOT volunteer your seat like I did. Because it will only be a nightmare for you. Spirit Airlines will offer you a Voucher to get you to give up your seat and the Voucher can not be used for more than one trip. I got a voucher for a $1000 sounds good, Also they said they will give me a hotel and food for the night and they will get me home the next day. Ok sounds good. Unfortunately, this is the kicker the ticket agent is not telling you the public, The one $1000 Voucher can not be used for more than one flight. I brought a ticket out of the $1000 dollars for $205.00 remaining $795 this balance can not be used to book remining flight because Spirit Airlines is saying this was only a one time use. So my remaining balance of $795 went down the drain. Also the flight they book for me to go home was with United. This is how the flight went I would leave MCO-IAD then get off the plane and go find the public train to go to the other airport which is DCA-EWR. After finding that out and complained they change it at the airport and send me from MCO-DENVER-NEWARK.",-1

They charged us twice for the CARRY ON and charged us to upgrade seats and stills gave us the wrong seats. In Cancun, Mexico they the manager on the fly april/15 at 12:20pm was rude and unprofessional. She shouldn’t be dealing with any customers service job related. Over all the worse experience ever when it comes to flying. They charge you even if you call customer service over the phone - ridiculous.

2023-04-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Orlando,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,One dysfunctional crew at Orlando airport,True," One dysfunctional crew at Orlando airport. I would give them 0 out of 10 if allowed. We get to the airport early from a cruise and check our bags at the kiosk. Go back outside to get in line because it was extremely long. Get all the way to the counter in about an hour just to be told they would not take our bags because we were too early, even though the kiosk allowed us to tag them. Then we need to come back and go through the line again once we are 4 hours away from flight time. So my simple question to the very unprofessional desk team was why did the kiosk not print our luggage tags and save us the time from the BS of waiting in line? Of which the supervisors most intelligent response was “we are not responsible for your bags!” After refusing to move we were finally allowed to not have to wait in line and sit on the side. Attention Spirit employees, if you want to make a difference at your god awful company please suggest for the kiosk to be only allow baggage tags to print 4 hours prior to flight, then your passages may not be so irate after your whole unorganized transaction occurs.",-1
2023-04-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denver,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no possible way to contact a person,True,"  Spirit Airlines is great as long as you like dealing with robots. There is no possible way to contact a person in customer service if you have a problem. The on-line chat is not staffed by a person, but rather just FAQ's, the phone #s go nowhere, and hang-up on you. Their web-site is a joke, where after paying for your flights, you be required to then pay for a seat when you check-in and try to get a seat assignment. You will need to now pay anywhere from $13 to $50 for a  seat, and then pay for a carry-on or checked bag. These items will likely cost more than your initial flight. Here's a breakdown of what I was charged: 2 one-way tickets $552.02 Purchased 1 month in advance 2 checked bags & one Carry on $282.00 Minimum cost of an actual (middle) seat $26 Tax $67.76 Total $927.78  I tried to check in 24 hrs prior to the flight, and was charged for seats, bags & carryon, but the website locked up and didn't give me a seat assignment, forcing me to start-over. I saw that it did charge my debit card, so knowing I would likely have trouble disputing it on a debit card, so now I started over using my Capital One Credit Card, so I could dispute it should it come to pass. Well guess what, I had to dispute it because in the end, Spirit Airlines refused to refund my 1st payment and didn't even acknowledge the charge, I have proof on my bank statements, but you can't speak to a person. If you love fighting with nameless people and robots, You should definitely fly Spirit Airlines.",-1

2023-04-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Absolutely dreadful experience,True,"  Worst airline in America. Avoid at all costs. I’ve flown Spirit 5 times in the last 5 months. Multiple late flights, multiple missed lay overs. It always takes 1-2 hours to get baggage: They try to make it seem like their mistakes are your fault. Try to make it seem positive when they’re only 3 hours late. Absolutely dreadful experience",-1
2023-04-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Myers,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,This airline is terrible,False,"  Was scheduled to fly out of Boston on Wednesday, April 12th at 820 pm, 1 announcement at 7.30 pm that the gate was changed. Thankfully, we heard it as we were walking to the gate and changed directions to the newly assigned gate. When preparing to board(late) many passengers were running to the gate bc they didn’t hear the original announcement change of gate and were at the original gate which was unattended and still had the flight listed and “on time” message on the board. Then, when finally boarding at new gate, another announcement saying the flight has been cancelled. We luckily got to the counter to rebook ahead of most (about 5th in line), waited for 45 mins to speak to 1 of only 2 people working the desk to service about 200 people. Long story, basically got no flights going out until Sunday! 4 days later!! We ended up booking another flight departing 2 hours from Boston. This airline is terrible. As we were leaving the airport I couldn’t help but notice the over 150 still in line trying to rebook. With 2 people working, no doubt they would have been in line for at least 3 or 4 hours just to be told, “sorry, we can get you out in 4 days (for more $$$) or issue a refund, waste of time. First and last time booking with this horrible airline. Never mind the added fees and 40 lb bag limit (not the 50 lb norm), $89 bag check in, $9 Wi-Fi charge and $14 to choose your seat. Total rip off! Avoid at all cost.",-1
2023-04-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Charleston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Will never fly Spirit again,False," Will never fly Spirit again. They cancelled my flight, which happens. But, when I asked them to refund the cancelled flight so I could buy a new ticket elsewhere, they cancelled BOTH MY FLIGHTS SCHEDULED WITH THEM! I did not ask them to do this, and when I noticed they had cancelled my return flight also, I called customer service and they basically told me that I was out of luck. I ended up spending almost double what I had initially spent to get new flights. I think it was a blessing in disguise, so I never had to deal with Spirit again. Good riddance.",-1
2023-04-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,terrible business,True, Flight delayed with out any communications whatsoever according to the issue.

2023-04-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,disrespects passengers,False," Warning!! Do not buy ticket with Spirit Airlines. This is an airline that disrespects passengers. We booked a flight that was delayed for 4 hours without any advance notice. They didn't let us change the flight date and demanded more money. We were told that it was because we were waiting for another flight, but actually there was no pilot. When I tried to contact them, I received an email reply in a language I don't know. Shame on an airline. Be careful not to order tickets from them.",-1
2023-04-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Phoenix,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no Spirit in their customer service,False,"  The customer service is awful. I booked my flight online, received my confirmation email which stated the flight was cancelled. The flight was rebooked with a confirmation of departure. However I was still charged for the cancelled flight. When speaking with customer service I was told I had cancelled the flight so no refund would be issued. This was not the case at all. I would not suggest this airline. There is no Spirit in their customer service.",-1
2023-04-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Reno to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,don’t care about service,True," Do Not Fly This Airline. Customer service does not know what they are doing let alone airline. Then when I go to check in This must be the worst scary airline around. They changed my reservation then changed reservation then cancelled part of reservation. They do not know what they are doing. Revised my flight booked two months ago from Reno to Las Vegas at 7:30 arrive at 9 then 10:30 flight to Ft Lauderdale. Had 1 1/2-hour layover in Las Vegas. Then they send revised Reno flight To Las Vegas leaves at 9 get in at 10:30 and connection to Ft Lauderdale leaves at 10. When I called, they said nothing they could do but said I should book another flight to Las Vegas on another carrier and take Spirit from Las Vegas to Ft Lauderdale. Needing to get to Ft Lauderdale I spent $150 on Southwest to get to Las Vegas. Only to learn when I did not receive confirmation on Spirit flight after spending 1 hour with customer service setting up flight I called and learn she cancelled my booking. Customer service lied to me. Spent another hour with another customer service rep rebooking. I would not fly this airline unless you don’t care if flight changes happen regularly, they lie, don’t care about service, flights might no be able to connect and are willing to pay more because they have limited flights that change last minute.",-1
2023-04-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas  to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I’ll never fly Spirit again,True,  First of all I flew Spirit to Dallas from Atlanta. Dallas was suppose to be a vacation I had no problem bringing my bag from Atlanta same bag no more no less I get ready to come home and they wait until I get to the gate to tell me I have to check my bag it’s too big! What well I brought the bag from Atlanta so why can’t I take it back without paying $99? When I asked to speak to the manager she pretended as if he wasn’t the manager and he would have to talk to someone else then he wouldn’t even be reasonable about it.  His reasoning was if he let me go by he’d have to let everybody else.  I’ll never fly Spirit again if I can help it.,-1
2023-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,a horrible experience,True,  I will never be flying Spirit again. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE LOW PRICES. They will screw you with heavy baggage fees of 400+ for baggage over 40lbs. Once you pay these ridiculous fees you can rest easy knowing there is a large chance your baggage will be lost for the entirety of your vacation. During this period you can also expect Spirit's customer service to be comparable to that of the DMV. The only decent thing about the flight was the built in lumbar support that came from the person behind me pressing their knees into the lower back portion of my seat. I do not blame this on the pour soul traveling behind me. The seats are so close together that their was a conga line of knees the whole way down the aisle. Overall it's a horrible experience and would only recommend flying this airline if you have a strong hatred for yourself and your family.,-1
2023-04-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,"  Worst experience ever. Started off with getting charged almost 400 extra dollars for luggage. Got upstairs to check in only to find out it was going to be a six hour delay. I do not recommend flying through them. Also the only compensation was a 14 dollar food voucher.  Their customer service was no help either. Overall experience, Terrible.",-1
2023-04-10,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Orange County to Sacramento via Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,customer service didn’t help at all,True," My flight was canceled and I called customer service who didn’t help me at all, asked to speak to a manager and he was no help either. I got on chat support and was able to solve my issue through there. If it wasn’t for him/her I would’ve been really upset and would not want to fly with this airline again!",-1

We flew Spirit 3-31-2023 and was supposed to come home from Los Angeles to Chicago on 4-4-2023. We were 6 mins past their 45 min cutoff because of their own employees not knowing what the hell they were doing and charged us an extra $400 to get home. Customer service told me the rules are you need to be at the airport 3 hours before your flight, but the email suggested 2 hours.  When I asked the lady for $400 she laughed at me over the phone. They wouldn’t help at all, not caring that my 13 year old son and 17 year old daughter had to sleep in the airport on seats with no security, no food or drinks, no nothing. I will never fly spirit again. If I could give them negative stars I would.  The prices for their luggage check are outrageous, the prices on the plane for drinks and snacks are outrageous ($9 for a can of soda and a bag of chips) $100 for 4 people round trip for Wi-Fi that didn’t even work. Other airlines either don’t charge for flight changes or they are minimum. We looked up other airlines and some are as low as $25. I have emailed them 3-4 times asking and showing proof we were at the airport on time and that our boarding passes show we were on time and an email about the Wi-Fi.",-1
2023-04-09,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to New York,2.0,,5.0,,2.0,5.0,1.0,a horrible experience with Spirit,True,  I had such a horrible experience with Spirit while traveling with small children. I was on hold for over 6 hours. Rude customer service over the phone was told they would honor my original luggage price to then transferring me to someone else and then he telling me that I needed to make a payment not the honored price plus an additional fee of 86.00 which is unheard of. I told him I had the proof as I screen shot the error message the spirit website was giving me and it is not my fault. He said “you either pay this amount or you don’t fly with your luggage”. Thank the heavens I met an amazing lady Anna at the MYR airport who assisted me and was able to honor the price that I was originally supposed to pay. She was my angel through this entire traumatizing experience. Thank you so much Anna!,-1
2023-04-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Orlando via Houston,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,The customer service sucks,False,"  I regret and will never fly this airline again. The customer service sucks. By the way the phone number in Orlando Florida lost baggage claim won't ring, you have to call the Atlanta phone number and then the person in Orlando will just hung up on you.",-1
2023-04-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Do not bother use this airline,True,"  I had a flight before they made a big scene about the luggage fee I paid over online which was round trip $112. They told me either pay it or leave the bag, or I am free to not to take flight. No manager presence. The airplane was like box. Do not bother use this airline. I paid $352 total. I cancelled 48 hrs prior my flight. No refund even though I had insurance. I decided to dispute no insurance paperwork online.",-1
2023-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Dallas Ft Worth,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst service ever encountered,False,"  We have used this lower tier ""low cost"" travesty before but can usually manage a satisfactory trip by paying double the cost for larger and actually comfortable seats upfront. On this trip, the problems began before we even got to the airport. While trying to add our bag the website would not advance to a point where could select our bag size let alone attempt to pay for it. Screw it! We'll pay the higher cost at the airport. We'll upgrade our seats. Two attempts at trying to pay for that online was met with further frustration and inability to pay their ridiculous price for the upgrades. We'll fix this at the airport too. Because of the failed attempts to pay for the upgraded seats, our bank locked our debit card for potential fraud.  The help at the ticketing counter could care or less. Nobody else is having a problem they said. The seats had secured but we still had to pay for them still. We don't want them give us back our original seats. They already gave them away. We can pay for the upgrades and our carry-on or just pay for the carry-on and be seated, probably separately, at the gate. To those of you wanting to gamble on getting the worst service ever encountered in the history of airline travel, good luck to you but I think we have your airline.",-1
2023-04-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Portland via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience I have ever had,False,"  This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with flying. I will never fly on Spirit again. Their customer service people are horrible and the bag charge is a rip off. I was trying to book an affordable trip, but after the bag fees, which I admit I didn't know about because I didn't read the fine print, I could have flown on one of the better airlines for less money. I had to pay $100 to put my bag in the overhead bin on the way to Portland and another $88 to check my bag coming back. Then on my return trip, Spirit lost my bag and made it out to be my fault. I am still trying to work out how to get my bag. I do not recommend this airline.",-1
2023-04-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cleveland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no help whatsoever,False," Flight for 5pm on 4/5 delayed 2.5 hrs (no biggie) and then we sit for another hour or so before being told the flight was canceled. Now sitting in said airport since about 945pm and it is now 141am it’s honestly terrible how poorly their “customer service” line is. “I have been waiting for an email this whole time”. Absolutely no help whatsoever and quite frankly doesn’t seem to know how to do their jobs properly. Absolute last time I fly with Spirit. If I could give it lower than a 1 star rating for this experience, I would.",-1

My luggage was never delivered to the address that I provided in Orlando. And I wasn't able to take my medicines for four days since they were in my luggage. I asked to be refunded for my luggage fees but the reply I got was, I should read the fine print. How would reading the fine print have done me any good? When my luggage left Las Vegas & I did not see it again until I returned to Las Vegas. So I wound up paying to check my luggage that went to Orlando, then back to Las Vegas without me never having the use of my belongings. The very least Spirit Airlines should do is at least refund my luggage fees.",-1
2023-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Newark,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline I have ever flown,False,  By far the worst airline I have ever flown. Waited on hold for customer service to tell us that we had the 50+lbs and when we checked our bags in they told us we did not. We were told over 5 times that we had 50 lbs for our checked bags. Spirit Airlines was unable to do anything for us and I will never be flying with Spirit Airline again.,-1
2023-04-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,people need to stop using them,True,"  This company shouldn’t be in business. Don’t think that you are getting a good deal on a tickets. After you pay for your seat and baggage and even a water in the plane 4$ to be exactly you are paying more for a ticket. And for a company that you can’t trust that don’t care about the clients. Yesterday all the gates for spirit in Orlando was delayed flights and they all saying the same waiting for a flight crew. My flight was supposed to leave Orlando at 4:30 they kept changing gates and waiting for crew at 11:30 at night they cancel the flight mean while was 3 older ladies on the wheelchair waiting all day - I ask the front desk people if they could get a water and some food for the ladies, they told me that was not they problem. It is a bad company and people need to stop using them.",-1
2023-04-02,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Nashville to Pensacola,,,,,,2.0,2.0,completely misled and lied to,False,  Timely customer service but I was completely misled and lied to. I had to cancel my flight for medical reasons. I was told I needed to pay $150 fee to cancel but would receive a flight credit for the rest. I specifically ask what the amount of my flight credit would be before I agreed. I was told $400 plus so I agreed. Two days later when I received my flight credit I was shocked to see that I was charged for two other miscellaneous fees with no explanation adding up to over $300. What a complete rip off.,-1
2023-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Aguadilla,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,How is this company in business?,False,"  How is this company in business? They “canceled” our entire trips flights a week after booking due to “Covid” a month before we were scheduled to leave April of 2023. We spent 8 hours trying to amend this issue to find out from one rep those flights were still available - they may be able to get us on but we’d be paying almost 1000 more, he would call back in 20-30 mins. Never a call back. Went on hold again 3 more times to reps who are in a foreign country with service cutting out so they had to repeat everything 15 times to make out what they said. Put on hold and disconnected. No calls back. They just wanted us to book for more money! And every 5 mins the flights you just looked at aren’t available and then maybe they are for more money 5 mins later as if they do this on purpose. Called for a refund and say we will get confirmation in one hour and no problem refunding - no email no refund. Will never fly with them.",-1
2023-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Terrible customer service,False,"  The worst airline to exist. Terrible customer service. The rudest people, horrible service, absolute trash. Completely wasted our time since we could’ve easily made it to our flight but they delayed us even more for a tiny mistake on our boarding which they could have fixed but didn’t because they are insincere. Never fly this airline unless you want to get cheated or trust the people to help you out.",-1
2023-04-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Absolutely pathetic customer service,False,"  Booked my flight on spirit.com for a flight and hotel. Something came up and 2 days later I tried to cancel which is still over half a month from the flight date. Flight cost was suppose to be $93 each which is great but apparently they have a 24 hour cancellation policy, anything above that is $99 each so I had my trip booked for 2 days and it’s going to cost me $200 to cancel it with almost 3 weeks remaining till the flight. Absolutely pathetic customer service, even worse policies and all in all a huge rip off. I will never book with this horrible company again. Charging more to cancel than it would be to go. This company needs to be shut down. Would rate a 0 if possible.",-1
2023-04-02,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,Never flying Spirit again,True,  Delays. Long lines outside when arriving just to check bag or in. Only airline doing that all others had no lines outside. Rude staff at gate desk when asked simple questions. On this flight waited 20 minutes on runway for a gate. Waited longer on our flight in on the runway. Never flying Spirit again. Customer service other than flight attendants is terrible.,-1
2023-03-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,Will never use them again,False,"  This was the worst airline I have ever been on. The staff was great under a bad circumstance. We arrived almost three hours early, thinking we only needed to use the kiosk for tags, but they were out of order. Went into the line, only to find that the entire system was down. The employees were great by explaining to the large crowd what was happening. After a while, they started calling people by times of departure. Not bad employees, bad company organization. When I got to the airplane I realized they had hand written boarding passes and luggage tags. After we found our seats, some people had duplicate seats and needed to get ticket counter involved. We had a late take off. On our way back, we had a different airline, but when we passed by Spirit in the Orlando, all their kiosks were out and they had a long line at the ticket counter six days later, just like in Chicago. Shows it was the company and their irresponsibility. Will never use them again.",-1

2023-03-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Portland via Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Skip Spirit at all cost,True,"  My 100 dollar trip turned into 400. Spirit is literally a joke. I had to make a last minute, one way trip from SAN to PDX. Didn’t need luggage. Easy flight. Delayed by three hours for weather. Poor communication. Four hour wait for customer service. Unbelievably rude gate agents in San Diego and Vegas, offering no assistance. Ended up being a 12 hour delay total with an overnight stay. I understand weather delays. No problem. But there was no way to adjust connecting flights until the window of time had closed. What would have been a quick jaunt from SAN to Vegas, a few slots in the terminal and then to PDX turned into a gigantic headache and the silliest, zero frills, hassle filled experience. Had I just paid the 300 bucks to travel direct on Alaska, I would have saved a hundred bucks. Expensive lesson learned. I had low expectations. That was too high. Please have no expectations. Skip Spirit at all cost.",-1
2023-03-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Need better customer service,True,"  Need better customer service. We were delayed more than 6hrs no one bothered to keep us updated. After paying for our tickets, had to pay for carry ons, seat etc. If we wanted a drink had to cough up more money, not even a small bag of peanuts. Spirit Airlines you have to do better. This was our first and last time flying with Spirit.",-1

I do not recommend. Won’t ever fly Spirit again!",-1
2023-03-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Miami,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Highly disappointed,True, I have never been more dissatisfied and disappointed in an airline experience in my life. My flight was delayed by over six hours and no one even apologised. We were all given a measly $7 food voucher for the airport which doesn’t even begin to make up for the inconvenience and disruption. Not to mention cost. I missed a Mimi Heat game that cost $300 because we got in six hours after we were supposed to. No weather issues just an issue with the plane itself. Highly disappointed. The airplane itself was uncomfortable and nasty and loud. I will never ever fly this airline again and guess I should have believed the memes and reviews online. This airline is trash don’t use them!,-1

Yes cheaper than other airlines but way more headache! They charge unrealistic fees! My husband by a mistake paid for check in bag $50, but I wanted to carry it on, online that fee would be $70, but on premises fee is $100! How is that even possible? The flight was delayed for 3 hrs without even notifying passengers ahead of time, on top of that after getting everyone on board they announced technical issues with the aircraft letting us go back to the terminal and then getting everyone back on board! 4.5 hrs wasted! On tops of that they did not even offer any meals/snacks or for gods sake water for free! A cup of water is $4! It’s inhumane! We will never ever fly with Spirit ever again nor will recommend to anyone! Very mad passenger!",-1

Mobile kiosk for airline did not work. Gate attendant was unhelpful. Aircraft was as uncomfortable as humanly possible. I have a return flight booked but will not ever fly Spirit again so will forfeit the ticket and have booked on a reputable airline.,-1
2023-03-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Puerto Rico,4.0,,4.0,,,3.0,3.0,Very disappointed and outraged,False,"  Very disappointed and outraged. When companies go this low, trying to get and catch every penny you have anyway they can, its just embarrassing. Just something you don't do. Let me explain: When a client pays in full for a service, unless this client asks for more services a company cannot impose any additional fees. I have traveled for the past 5 years and this incident never happened before. After paying my fare and taxes for the entire flights, when entering my 2nd flight this young lady tells me to stop to check the size of the hand bag. I said this is my second flight today and I paid for everything. Also, I have been traveling with the same bag for the past 2 years and never had a problem. I was actually forced to check the size of my bag and if not, I wouldn't be allowed to board the flight, I had already paid for! I can understand if purchasing or entering my first flight you would require this compliance, but not on the 2nd flight and when everything was paid up front in full. When I tried to accommodate my bag in the frame, It was about 1 inch over the limit. I couldn't shrink the bag because I had a small laptop and other small electronics. So Spirit forced me to pay another $100. You can imagine if I didn't have the money? How many elderly or people in need have this airline ripped off with this scam?? Spirit is not worth it. I rather pay $100 more for American Airlines or Delta, United, than this horrible experience. Please avoid these headaches and do not travel through Spirit.",-1

If you do, do not check a car seat or stroller at the gate. My car seat was completely damaged and Spirit refused to pay for the damages. My car seat was 8 months old and said that is not covered under the allowance in their agreement. The wait times to pick up your stroller and car seat after your flight is ridiculous. Their flight attendants said that spirit would cover the damages and I was denied instantly. I just flew in last night. I will never use them again. Ever.",-1

They charged me 200 dollars for personal bags! At the gate not suitcases! Personal bags!

I see why there are so many negative reviews now. Our flight was cancelled and they couldn't even send me an email/text, nothing, that it was cancelled. I was told by the people at the airport when I arrived with my 3 small children. Spirit first said it was cancelled due to weather conditions, and then she turned around 2 sentences later when speaking with my husband and said it was cancelled due to maintenance. We ended up having to spend another $700 to get a rental car and making the 10 hour drive with 3 kids! Now I’m waiting for a refund from Spirit and have been receiving nothing but a headache and a go around with them. They tried to say they couldn’t give me a refund due to me paying with a Mastercard! What? I have never heard anything like this! This was my very first experience with Spirit and I promise it will be my last! Run while you can!",-1

The flight was cancelled and they couldn't even send me an alert that it was cancelled. I was told by people at the airport Spirit doesn't like flying in the rain so if its raining its going to get cancelled. Now I have to wait 90+ days for a refund because they have so many refund requests. This was my first and last experience with Spirit.,-1

I was to fly out on a Wednesday at 9am, they cancelled the flight for no reason, I changed airport to New York then cancelled that one so back to NJ airport for 11pm flight then they delayed that one! Coming home was the same thing delayed, delayed. Seats are so tiny felt like I was in a sardine can, flight attendants have no personality, awful experience! I should have just used United or American Airlines! Do yourself a favor and never fly this airline!",-1

They messed up our flight from Oakland to Dallas Fort Worth since they delayed our connecting flight to Las Vegas for some “odd” reason and we didn’t know that until we checked our bags in at Oakland that following morning. The next flight out was the next two days and one of the spirit employees at the ticket desk almost messed up our flights again due to him not understanding what we were wanting to do like you don’t understand that we are trying to get a flight back to DFW since they messed up our flight in the beginning. It’s funny how they can’t fully refund our flights, but they give us a $50 voucher to use for the next flight like that’s not gonna cover anything since the flights are around $100-1,000 per person so it’s pointless. I just don’t like this airline since they have a terrible system and especially the credit card they use for “points” that goes towards your flights when in reality the points that they’re wanting is a lot and you have to spend quite a bit on the credit card to even get a flight for only using points and it doesn’t even cover the bags?  Don’t book flights with them unless you want to deal with a lot of cancellations.",-1

I had a second row seat (for an extra $350 bringing the total RT ticket price including 1 checked bag to $1,100) so I was a couple of yards from their party. Yes, party. All they did was drink something from a plastic cup and howl hysterically over each others jokes - for 4 hours. If service was requested, they simply scowled at you. I did manage to acquire a single glass of wine. I brought the empty cup and mini bottle to the front on my way to the restroom and an attendant became unhinged yelling at me for breaking protocol as all garbage needed to be handled with gloves. OK, but just let me know politely, I have not read the manual. Never again. Joke of an airline. Hidden fees, always late, rude staff. No thanks.",-1

Not only do they nickel and dime you in every way possible, but their customer service essentially laughs in your face when you need their help. I cannot stress enough how awful this airline is and would urge everyone to pay a little extra to go with one of the more professional airlines.

I booked a flight for my daughter. The flight was delayed from Las Vegas. She had a connecting flight from Detroit which also got delayed. However she got an email that she was now booked on a flight the next day. Despite all her efforts and pleas they refused to put her back on the same day connecting flight and refused to issue a refund. They were also very arrogant and misbehaved with her. We will never travel with Spirit again even if it is the last airline in the world.,-1

This required a 24-hour layover instead of the scheduled 90- minute layover. So instead of arriving on a Saturday at 1pm, l would arrive on a Sunday at 7pm. Customer service was awful and only offered me a refund. They refused to provide me with any assistance whatsoever. I had to book a flight with a different airline last-minute at a big cost.",-1

My flight to Cancun was canceled, I remained stuck in Orlando with them proposing me either to go to Texas and sleep in Houston airport to take the 7:45 flight to Cancun the day after, or to sleep in the Orlando airport to take the 4pm flight the day after! I am shocked by the fact that their lateness seems systematic somehow, the times indicated will never be the ones really applied. I am French, and if I had known beforehand the reputation of spirit amongst the American airlines, I would have definitely invested a hundred more bucks to get a more reliable company.",-1

On the way home we were delayed due to the “plane being too hot”. It was 14 degrees outside. Finally when we boarded, one of the staff members got sick so we needed to wait another 30 minutes. When we finally arrived back to Orlando on this flight we went to claim our bags and it took over 2 hours for our bags to appear. Not only did it take forever to get out bags, but the staff had no idea where the bags were going to come out from. They had us running around from section to section to check. This 2 hour delay after our previous delay made us get stuck in rush hour going home and overall caused a 6 hour difference.",-1

I don't know how people run business like that. How do people even enjoy spirit airlines with their inefficiency,-1
2023-03-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,creating hassles for passengers,True," I had a flight today with Spirit Airlines (03/17/2023) at 11 AM in the morning. At 8 AM, I receive an email from Spirit Airlines saying that my flight has been cancelled. I texted their customer support and a person joined the chat after half an hour and I told her my situation. She said let me check for a while and moments before I realized, the staff member had already disconnected my chat. I realized that after I messaged the chat once again saying if they were still on line or not. Then, I called the customer service and tried explaining my situation to them. I am a student and I needed to go to Dallas from Tampa because I could not afford another day of stay. So they offered me other options like connecting me to Houston or Austin, both of which are far away from where I live. Not having a car, it would had become really difficult for me to travel from those areas. Spirit agents told me that the next available flight was on Monday which was a hassle for me. I requested them to book a plane for me to Philadelphia, if anything is available because my family members live there and I would had have a place to stay. They did not even grant me this request and I had to cancel my flight in the end. I had came to Tampa on a vacation that turned into a disaster due to the Spirit flight cancellation. I would never ever board this plane ever again in my life. Amongst all American flights I have ever boarded, Spirit airlines tops my list of creating hassles for passengers. I had a really important meeting today, but I had to cancel it because of my flight. Now I am spending $500 for a Delta and American Airlines connection to go to Dallas, and that too I have to spend my night at Atlanta airport. Whoever is reading this, kindly judge your options before booking a Spirit Airlines flight again. Thank You",-1

I had bad experience with spirit airlines right from the boarding gate it started, they are trying to cause inconvenience to all passengers and stopping them for bag size check, they want to make sure they take some money out of your pocket. I was not even carrying a “back pack” I had a small bag with wheels and they considered it as carry on and charged extra 99$. I tried requesting the supervisor and gate staff telling them that I don’t even have any back pack and this bag is tiny and small and equivalent to back pack but they were not helpful and on top one of the staff was laughing on my situation and was not considerate helpful as well. I explained them that only wheels of the bag doesn’t fit in that bag testing thing at the airport boarding gates and they still made me paid 99$ .

Horrible customer service and I kept getting transferred to different people who have no sense of knowledge! The plane is awful, the seats are beyond uncomfortable, and the flight attendants are so careless. Don’t expect a refund or any sort of flight credit if you have to change your itinerary, they take more than half of that for “supposed fees”. This whole airline is a complete joke.",-1
2023-03-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan PR to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I am never flying Spirit again,False,"  Approximately 1 hour before the flight, I was told by Spirit's ticket representative that I did not have to pay $99 baggage fee. When my 7 yr old daughter, wife and I were boarding I was told that I had to pay the $99 fee. We were one of the last persons to board and told my wife and daughter to go their respective seats. I grieved and then when I told the Spirit boarding rep that I wanted to take items off my bag in order to condense the bag like I saw one of the passengers who boarded 15 minute before me do, I was told it was too late to take items out of my bag. Therefore Spirit's unilateral assessed a $99 fee. It is unilateral because if I did not pay the $99 I either had to continue to complain and miss my flight and my 7 yr daughter and wife were on the airplane so that was not viable. Or I would have to leave my bag that was the subject of the fee at the San Juan Airport - also a horrible option. Once inside the plane I noted the cheap, cramped seating and the tray which was not working properly. I am never flying Spirit again.",-1

I had a flight from San Diego to Albuquerque with a layover in Las Vegas. My first flight was an hour delayed. Before we took off for the first flight I received a notice that my second flight was delayed an hour, then 2, then 3, then 4. Email after email announcing delays. Finally, after sitting in the Vegas airport for hours, I got a notice that my flight was cancelled. They rebooked me on a flight the next morning and all they offered was a $7 meal voucher. No hotel. Nothing. I was on hold over an hour to be told this, and told by in person staff (who couldn't care less) that I needed to go talk to someone in ticketing, which is on the opposite side of security. Worst customer service. Worst flight. Worst company.",-1

We’re told this was round trip. When we checked in no bags were showing as paid for. Total spent on bags was over 1500 dollars round trip. Customer service says that these charges are all correct. The bags cost one third of what we paid for the entire trip! This is robbery and false information was told to use. I will never use this airline ever again.,-1
2023-03-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Guatemala,,,,,,2.0,1.0,$71 to take on a carry-on bag,False,"  This has been one of the worst experiences of my life. Everything about this Airline is a lie. They advertise cheap tickets, but what they don't tell you is they charge you for every single thing including your seats, extra for your luggage. anything you do costs money. They cut you 10 lb short on each checked bag so you're only allowed 40 pounds for each piece of luggage, and if you go one pound over they charge you an extra $79 on top of the $61 it already costed to check the bag. It cost $71 to take on a carry-on bag. The people are unwilling to help, you can't understand anyone when you call. I will never fly with this Airline again. I thought Delta was high and I was going to save money and in reality it ended up costing more that had I just flown Delta I will never make that mistake again. You can call and sit on hold for an hour and when you reach someone they are of no help, number one you can't understand them and number two they don't know what they're doing. If I had this to do over I would fly any Airline but spirit and I haven't even boarded the plane yet.",-1

I would recommend walking before booking with this airline. Not only was my flight repeatedly delayed making me miss two days of my vacation. The customer service was horrible. Trying to talk to agent is next to impossible. They have cancelled my flight home stating it was overbooked and want me to pay an additional 440$ for a flight I already paid for.

What is unacceptable is that I Paid for the big front seats and I was told that on my rebooked flight that the big seats were already filled and there is no refund for the seats. All they could provide is a 90 day credit. This is not acceptable solution as I don’t have any travel plans for the next 90 days. So in short Spirit stole 104.00 from me.,-1

Days later the pending charge posted to my account. I called them and they advised that nothing showed on their End asking that the flight be cancelled.

I have never been so outraged by a company! My fiancé and I booked a nice vacation to Nicaragua in hopes to escape the hustle and bustle of our everyday lives. As our vacation came to an end, it was time we packed our bags and headed to the airport for our flight home. We unfortunately made the mistake of booking all our flights with Spirit airlines. We were soon informed that our 1:45am flight from Managua to Fort Lauderdale, Florida was delayed until 3am. Due to the delay we missed our flight from Fort Lauderdale to Newark. So with that being said, my fiancé and I were upset due to the inconvenience. But we kept calm and asked when the next flight from Florida to Newark would be, and we were told there were no available flights until the following day. So we proceeded to ask if there were any flights to other airports in the area such as New York or Philadelphia. Same answer nothing until the following day. So we also asked who was going to pay for our hotel in Florida since the fault was on Spirit for the delay. We were told Spirit doesn't cover any accommodations. Needless to say my fiancé and I will be stranded in Florida for one whole day through no fault of our own. I will never ever ever fly Spirit again and I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy. They are horrible! I warn anyone and everyone to think twice before booking any flights with this ignorant company!!",-1

Never made announcements until its actually time to board. Time online and on TV still said “ON TIME” for some reason. Why do they offer so many “commodities” you pay for nonsense fees like a seat after I already purchased the ticket ? And cant ever get a simple flight without any inconvenience. They've had us waiting for 2-3 hours, people have lives and if I paid to arrive at a certain time is because I need to make it by then! They don't even offer any snacks for the inconvenience and thank us for our patience. But do we have a choice !? Highly do not recommend if you have any sense of purpose and travel regularly.

The flight attendants were congregated at the front of the plane discussing a pregnancy and how horrible their jobs were, we could hear every word! Our flight home was scheduled to depart from Vegas just past 11PM, I received an email at 5PM, on the same day, with a flight cancelation notification and was booked on a flight 3 days later to fly back home. I called Spirit and asked for hotel vouchers and was told no because the flight was canceled due to weather. I asked for an earlier flight as we had to return for work, I was offered a flight 2 days later with a connecting flight from Florida to Detroit. I accepted after she said they would compensate me for a hotel. I called the number they gave me for the hotel and it was a hotel reservation company and they had no relations with Spirit and wanted $300/night for the only hotel available. I called Spirit back and while on the phone was looking at the departure board at the airport and noticed a Delta flight leaving Vegas to Detroit at the same time as what the original Spirit flight was scheduled for, I mention this to the Spirit airline manager and he tells me that it's because the airlines go to different areas which have different weather!

Seats are fine - better than expected. But not good for flights > 3 hours tops.  Plane was clean. Flight departed on time. I did notice poor/low policing of carry-ons and personal items. People clearly play the system as flight departed very early (4am) and staff was tired and wanted the plane to return to FLL asap.",1
2023-03-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Salt Lake City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,set up to give you the run around,True,"  Their customer support is set up to give you the run around, claims are difficult to file if you can at all.

2023-03-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando via Dallas,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit with a layover again,False,"  I've flown Spirit a few times, but the flights have always been non-stop prior to the trip I took this weekend. I only used spirit for our return flights home. We were traveling from Dallas to Ohio through Orlando. Our flight took off at 6 a.m. just a little after scheduled time. However, when we landed in Orlando, the jet bridge was broken and we sat on the plane for approximately 30 minutes while maintenance was called to fix it. However, our layover was only 60 minutes long. The flight attendants on this trip were extremely rude and only said that our connecting flights would ""hopefully"" wait. This was not encouraging and by the time we were able to get off the plane, the gate was closed and no one was at our gate. It was exactly the time that the flight was scheduled to depart. This was extremely frustrating considering we were in Orlando on the planebut couldn't deboard the plane. There were numerous people who were in our shoes as well. It seems as if Spirit purposely overbooks and hopes that these things happen so that they have an excuse to leave and not wait. When I got to the service desk to rebook my flight (don't bother calling customer service, they can't help you) the only flight out was at 8 p.m. This was 10:30 in the morning. They did not offer vouchers or anything for food since it ""was not within their control""- but if you ask me the maintenance of the flight deck should be well within their control. I asked to speak to a manager, knowing that they lady could only do so much. I really felt bad for her since the whole line of 20 + people were all there for the same reason. I let her know that it was nothing against her, but I wanted to speak with a manager since this was such a poor business practice. Again, no issues with the lady trying to help me except that she refused to call a manager for me to speak with. I had paid for a bundle to chose my seats since I was traveling alone with my 9 year old daughter. I purposely chose flights at the front of the plane. When rebooked, but boarding pass didn't have my carry on listed and we were booked all the way in the back row, without a window seat that I paid for. Since I had a 10 hour layover, I ended up returning to the service desk and speaking with someone else to talk about with this about. This person called a manager, Tony, who was the only  helpful person in the airport. He ended up giving us two 7 dollar meal vouchers, which together covered one dinner entrée in the airport, but it was at least something. He did switch us to a window and middle seat as well, but it was still in the last row, so we had 1/2 a window. My bags had already gotten taken to Columbus, so it was a nightmare trying to get them once I got into CMH at nearly midnight. Overall, the experience was chaotic and unenjoyable. I will avoid flying spirit at all costs from now on, even thought I am a spirit credit card member. We might still use them for direct flights, but I will never fly Spirit with a layover again. 10 hours on the floor of the Orlando airport was not something I ever want to relive. The only thankful part is that I was heading home and not TO my destination. I used Frontier to get to Dallas. The flight attendants in the back of my flight home were also very kind. I was thankful for them as well. Tony and the last two flight attendants would get 5 stars from me, but overall, Spirit showed me the meaning of ""you get what you pay for"" and I'll be much more careful in the fu",-1
2023-03-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Minneapolis,2.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,not be booking with Spirit ever again,False,"  Awful experience with spirit. Showed up 2 and a half hours before our flight, forced to check bags. Stood in line to check our bags for over an hour and a half only to be told it was too late to check a bag and got sent to another line. Stood in second line for 20 minutes before they shut the line down and sent us to the back of a third line. By the time we got through the line our flight left, many frustrated people behind us as we all had missed our flight. Spirit told us we needed to pay an additional $100 each and they would get us on a flight the following day. Three lines and four attendants just to miss our flight. Frustrating. We ended up getting a flight with Delta who were excellent to deal with and very empathetic with our situation. Will not be booking with Spirit ever again.",-1
2023-03-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Vegas,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,We will never fly Spirit again,False,"  Upon our return back to Indy, we arrived at Vegas airport with plenty of time to spare. While checking in we were told our flight take off time had changed for boarding which was an hour earlier. We were not notified of that. With proper assistance we could have made flight but Attendants did not know how to maneuver the situation and were sending us from one attendant to another. During the process there was still time for us to get to gate as we had arrived with plenty of time to spare. One employee said she needed to take a break and left us standing there. A passenger in front of us got into an argument with an attendant because she told him she could not help him. Since spirit bumped us we were told we’d have to pay $100.00 each for a new ticket. Our only choice was a flight home 12 hours later. We ended up buying one way tickets with Southwest whose attendants were more professional, more trained, and knew how to maneuver the problem to get us home 5 hours later. The moral of this mess for us and an extra $1,000 spent to get home. We initially flew Spirit to save money. Spirit costs us money and for that along with all the reasons of this story. We will never fly Spirit again. No matter how cheap their flights are. The prices are really too good to be true because they also charge you for your luggage, a juice, and tiny bag of a snack. Everything costs and seats are the worse.",-1

My issue is with the seats. I am 6 foot 2 and the seats are made for people 5 foot 2 or less. I did purchase seats with extra leg room for the trip home, but was asked to switch with a person who was too big to fit in a regular seat that should have paid extra as I did, I was nice and switched but shouldn't have been asked to. The regular seat I got on the way to Florida was by far the most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat in. There was absolutely no way to get comfortable for the 4.5 hour flight. It felt like torture. That being said...I had no other issues with the airline. The staff were friendly and everything ran smooth.",-1

2023-03-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,We will never fly Spirit again,False,"  There was nothing wrong with the plane. There was nothing wrong with the staff. The thing that was wrong was company ethics and lack of anything close to customer service. Our flight out was 2 hours late no big deal, we can flex getting into an unknown city at midnight. But, when we were headed home, up at 3am to get to the airport to catch an 8am flight and get a notification that the flight is cancelled, that definitely put us into a tailspin. Conversation with personnel via phone netted us nothing. We kept receiving updates that indicated that the flights were still a go after we received cancellation notices (a second flight was offered an hour later then cancelled). More talking on the phone and we were told our Monday morning flight could be completed on Wednesday evening. Then we were told we would get a refund for the ""unused portion"" if we chose not to go with them. So let's start adding it up: Two more nights in a hotel, seeing if our Turo owner could even continue to lend us a car for another more than 48 hours; making sure our car in a long-term parking lot in another city, in another state, could stay longer because we could do nothing about it; two lost work days and another flight on another carrier supposed to happen Wednesday morning which held a cancellation fee, and no help from Spirit Airlines whatsoever in finding an alternate flight. In the end we chose not to wait on an airline that could up and cancel again on Wednesday so we found ourselves having to choose to spend another $600 to fly home on a different carrier that same day. We will never fly Spirit again, what seemed like a savings ended up costing us another $800 or so and Spirit's total disregard for the chaos they caused will forever be etched in our psyche.",-1
2023-03-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Phoenix,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,never ever fly Spirit again,True,"  I bought a ticket and as many of you know you have to buy a seat which I did and I payed for my luggage. I didn’t take it onboard because I had lower Lumbar surgery 3 weeks before flying and I couldn’t lift the luggage. I payed about 79.00 for my luggage which had my laptop and my medication. I’m a disabled adult and I have blood pressure medication, cholesterol medication and pain medication. When I arrived in Phoenix I went to pickup my luggage. It never arrived. I told the Spirit airlines luggage agent and he went to check. He came back and told me it was still in Florida but stated that it would arrive the next day. I told him that my medication was in my luggage and to please make sure it was in Phoenix airport the next day. It never arrived. I started emailing Spirit and explained my situation. Nothing ever happened. My luggage finally came after 5 days of being without my medication and clothes and on the night before I was flying back. Just so you know I did not fly on Spirit on my return flight. Even Spirit did not reply to my request for reimbursement of my charge for my luggage. Spirit emailed me while my luggage was lost but when I contacted them for some reimbursement of my luggage fare and maybe more for the cloths I had to buy and such and they stopped any correspondence. I’ll never ever fly Spirit again.  They may have cheap fare but when you add the luggage and seating and the fact that you could loose your belongings it’s just not worth it BTW: I wasn’t the only ones who did not get their luggage on my flight. It seems Spirit might have some real issues that need to be addressed. They didn’t even reimburse me for my charge for my luggage.",-1

First the price - it seems at first glance that this airline is less expensive than some of the other airlines, However, after paying for you seats and carry on luggage, it turns out a lot more expensive. They do not provide any food, you even have to pay $4 for a small bottle of water, the seats are uncomfortable and don’t recline and are so narrow, even an average size person has to squeeze in there. Secondly, I had purchased insurance for my flight and ended up having to postpone my return trip due to illness. I was charged $290 (the round trip was $506) to change the flight as well as an additional charge for the second time for my seat. When I filed a claim through my insurance policy, I was denied, after receiving 10 emails with additional requests for more information. It seems futile to take out an insurance policy.",-1

They will abandon you. There is 2 inches of snow in Boston and because it’s weather related they canceled the flight and simply offered a refund. They did not offer to help with booking a flight on another airline, they will not pay for a hotel, they will not pay for rental car, they will not help at all. They will leave you stranded in another country fending for yourself and paying extra money to get home the $50 saved has now turned into $250 more on another plane ticket, a rental car, and 12 hours till I am home.

2023-02-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Cleveland via Las Vegas,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,nonsense of this experience,True," Terrible experience trying to make a MINOR change to a flight I have booked for March. Instead of flying from SLC to CLE, I needed to fly into CMH. This trip would be on the same day and with the same first-flight out of SLC into LAS. The only difference is flying on a different connecting flight out of LAS to CMH instead of to CLE. They refused to make this minor change and just let me pay the fare difference (the new flight path is actually a little MORE expensive), saying that I had no option but to pay this + $160 change fee (which is $60 more than the original flight). It would be cheaper for me overall to eat the cost of the original ticket and buy an entirely new one than to pay the change fee + fare difference. It would also be cheaper to eat the full cost of the original ticket and buy a separate one-way ticket from LAS to CMH to take that route after my first flight gets in from SLC. I understand that there are policies, but this was a MINOR adjustment that should be so simple to make, especially since the ONLY thing that would change is that my connecting flight to my final destination (departure city is the same, flight date is the same and the connecting flight departure time is only slightly different). Pretty unlikely to go with Spirit in the future given the nonsense of this experience. Cheap isn't always good. Very frustrating.",-1

Checked bag is $65, most other airlines charge $30. second checked bag +$77. On top of that weight limit is 40lbs. Most airlines are $50lbs. If you are 1 lb over its $99.

The problems I have with this airline (and this is the 3rd time now) is in its support staff. I am not sure whether it is a training issue or a hiring issue but this airline has some of the worst customer service people in the airline industry. On a this past flight, my bag came out missing a wheel. I went to bag claim services and the woman told me I could only file a claim online and handed me a card with a QR Code. When I attempted to file the claim online, I got a prompt that they were unable to do so. When I get through to a Customer Service person, she tells me they can only handle baggage claims at the airport, about an hour drive from my house!

The odds of winning has limits. On the first leg I was fortunate enough to be seated in row 1. Snagging row 1&2 is your best bet with Spirit. The early morning flight was on time. Upon arrival in Houston we went from a 9 to a zero. Multiple unexplained delays and ultimately a trip of 12 hours + my net takeaway is I won’t be back. The two flights were my first and last.

My boarding pass says gate 9A. They changed it to Gate 3 no announcement, no update on the original gate screen, no one to tell us. When I went to the front Spirit airlines counter they said they said it in the gate 3 loudspeaker. How does that help people 7 gates away ?

So we prepared to leave for LAX at 7pm which would have given us plenty of time to park and get through security.

2023-02-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Boston,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience I have ever had,True,"  This was the worst experience I have ever had. I understood that they would not provide any movies to watch and need to purchase any beverage and alcohol.  But what is problem is that there is lack of communication and lies. I did not get seats assigned due to the downsizing of aircrafts and so 40-50 passengers were misplaced. The attendants on counters at the airport, blamed some passengers like me on not picking seats beforehand and told a lie that they sent a notification email about the downsizing of aircraft. But I want to add to say that customer services did a better job: at least they seemed to be trained to listen to complaints and show some level of sympathy. They charged $79 for each check-in luggage, which is a lot but understandable since this is a cheap airline. But blaming passengers for not picking seats beforehand is unacceptable. In addition to that, when we landed at a destination after midnight, probably due to numerous reasons, we had to wait for 2 hours to get our luggage. Spirit office adjacent to a carousel was closed. No one was around to inform the passengers of what was going on. Zilch. I saw a few families leave for home, coming back a following day to pick up luggage. This is not acceptable.",-1

I will never fly with them again. First off, when checking in for the flight, they charge you for a carry on 55.00. Our flight was supposed to be at 6pm, the flight was delayed 4 times. We did not leave until 1030. Then to comp you they email you a QR code for 14 bucks to use on the airplane, you can’t use it. All drinks and snacks you have to purchase in the flight. The plane says free Wi-Fi on the outside of the plane, no Wi-Fi at all and the stewardess laughs about and says get your money back on the website.

2023-02-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never had such a negative experience,True,"  I have never had such a negative experience with an airline than I have had with Spirit Airlines. If you’re going to enforce a policy so strict as their personal bag policy, then at least be consistent with it from beginning to end. I brought a personal backpack with me and was completely fine flying out of my home airport, but coming back the Spirit Airline crew was so nasty, rude, bullies and selective about who they would bully into paying extra money for a backpack to go underneath a seat. As soon as I got into the TSA line I was told I needed to try and measure my bag. I added nothing extra from my trip and they even tried to lie and say I couldn’t bring another bag that only consisted of food and snacks. The Spirit airline attendant was so rude, that I couldn’t believe she was even allowed to interact with customers on a daily basis in the manner that she did with me. She told me for the convenience of checking my bag with her, it would be $99 because I didn’t check it in the app before TSA, but a friend of mine checked a nearly 40 pound bag downstairs and paid only $59. No consistency there whatsoever. And not only was I forced to measure my bag before TSA, but they continued to pick on me before boarding by having me measure the same bag right before boarding. It is completely ludicrous at how they choose to be randomly selective on who they’re going to traumatize before their flight. Only to get onto the flight and see all types of bags not checked and being placed into overhead bins, when my bag fit under my seat perfectly fine. I am so frustrated, angry and confused with this airline. I understand having a job to do, but there was no patience or any type of kindness while I was panicking and trying to figure out another way to get my backpack through without a ridiculous additional $99. This airline company is so inconsiderate, inconsistent and grimy with how they choose to operate their business with certain customers (most likely the ones on a budget). I said it once and I’ll say it again — if you’re going to have a strict personal bag policy such as Spirit airlines does, then it should at least be carried out in the exact same manner for every airport. This company desperately needs to reconstruct their entire system. I will never for as long as I travel, ever give my money or business to such a tragic company as Spirit airlines.",-1

Wanted to save some money so Spirit looked like the best option. We were told our flights got cancelled and they put us on a different flight, but it didn’t work with our schedule. We wanted to see if we could change our flight to Philly and take a train down to Baltimore as that would have worked better for our set aside vacation time. Person helping us on the phone said we couldn’t do that and LITERALLY called us DUMB. Maybe they call it Spirit because you got to pray to get some decent service.",-1
2023-02-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Milwaukee to Fort Myers,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,from lousy to extremely terrible,True," I have flown Spirit many, many times. For years I stopped because their service was so terrible, that it wasn't even worth using them if the flights were free. Then COVID came along, and service on American Airlines and United suffered, so I tried Spirit again. Their service went from lousy to extremely terrible! Other than the seats being uncomfortable, the planes not kept very clean, and chronically late, they keep changing flight schedules after you have been confirmed! Most recently they changed my flight 2 times. Very inconvenient. Then on the second time they forgot to assign my seat, even though I paid the extra for the ""Big Seat"" reservation at the very beginning. I noticed the seat was gone when I checked-in the night before. I called customer service and after a long wait the rep said ""Oh, we never move your seat assignment when we change schedules."" What? That was simply not true because they kept my seat assignments on the first change, and even on one of the legs after they made the second change. I hung up, called back, waited a long time, then got a different agent who said they somehow gave my seat away be mistake, it was probably just a glitch when they changed the flight, I should re-book the seat and pay the $206 charge, and then they would refund that to me. So I did that and got my seat back. Guess what? No refund! So I filed a complaint with Spirit and got a written reply that there would be no refund! What a bunch of IDIOTS, LIARS and CROOKS! I'll have to dispute this with the credit card company.",-1

A week later the flights were 100 dollars a piece cheaper. They want $100 per ticket to change the tickets to the same flights on the same day. If I cancel the reservation altogether I have 90 days to rebook but yet they charge me $100 per ticket to bank my tickets. I want to congratulate spirit airlines on being the number one airline in 2022 with the most complaints. Usually you get a discount for booking ahead of time.

I cannot express enough what an amazing supervisor you have in Akeem - we waited on a flight for 16 hours and eventually it was cancelled. Akeem went above and beyond to get us on to the next available flight and hotel accommodations all whilst other passengers were speaking aggressively and irately at him. Akeem stayed peaceful kept his composure and delivered the best possible resolution to help my family and myself out.,1
2023-02-22,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Orlando via Salt Lake City,3.0,,5.0,,,3.0,3.0,So many hidden fees,True," So many hidden fees! You think you are getting a good deal and everything you do is an add on fee. No refunds on luggage that we didn't have but paid for. No screens, no complimentary drinks or snacks. Every carry on and luggage is a huge fee, even if I didn't have a carry on but paid for in advance. I probably will never fly Spirit again. Very cheap! I could say I guess you get what you pay for but the flight ended up costing me more because of all the add ons.",-1
2023-02-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Pittsburgh,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst airline experience ever,False," Worst airline experience ever. I would highly recommend not going for cheap due to the experience we had with Spirit and their customer service in Orlando yesterday 2/20/23. We arrived at the Orlando (MCO) airport at 11am and went to gate 9 were we were to board our Spirit plane and depart for Pittsburgh at 1:25pm. The made an announcement that ask for volunteers to book another flight because they over booked the flight. I assume no one volunteered so they redirected us to gate 25. We get to gate 25 and they announce that there is mechanical issues with our plane and a plane 1/5 the size of the original plane that they already overbooked was going to Pittsburgh, but if your sequence # was 155 or higher you needed to go to luggage claim and pick up any checked bags and report to Spirit customer service desk to rebook a flight. Well needless to say there were about 80+ people that had sequence numbers higher than 155 and we were a party of 4 out of that group. So we decided to divide and conquer. My husband and our friend went to pick up luggage (which took them 2.5 hours to pick up) and our other friend and I went to customer service desk (we were one of the first ones there). We walk up to the desk and the lady #1 was very rude #2 had no idea what she was doing. She booked the 4 of us on another flight with 1 layover landing in Pittsburgh at 12am (that was after they tried to book us on a flight at 2:48pm that was currently boarding and then laughed at us when we asked if they could get us through security). The lady said I don’t know how to use this app. So I asked her to get someone over there that did. The manager comes over and they both stare at the screen for awhile push some buttons then the manager walks away and the lady looks at me and says those flights are no longer available. I was like what?? 15 people (is the least that I counted) that was behind us in line all very irate got flights to Pittsburgh that night. We used our phones and found 4 flights to Pittsburgh that night for $4,000 through Delta and I offered to buy but I wanted reimbursed by Spirit. The manager said let me make a note (15 minutes later) she looks at me and says did you make a decision yet? I was one click away from purchasing the Delta flights when I said I’m waiting on you to confirm the reimbursement. The manager says to me I can’t do that. Then another manager comes along and starts yelling at all the customers who are already tired, frustrated, and some scared. She told me to shut up and wait until it was my turn to talk. She yelled at a poor lady and teenaged daughter who was trying to get home to care for her mom who was on hospice (had this woman who was not yelling and was very calm the entire time in tears and shaking to the point it was scaring her teenage daughter). We ended up getting a flight home today with one stop in NJ (7.5 hours). Happy to report we made it home finally, but will never fly Spirit again. Do better Spirit especially the Orlando crew that day. They need disciplined or fired for the way they treated their customers and should never be in a management position. However, a supervisor for Spirit that we spoke to on the phone after we left the airport did a great job in fixing the issue (the managers at the Orlando airport only gave us 3 tickets and we had 4 people in our group). Spirit MCO rude and incompetent. Never again! Thank you United Airline for getting us home safely and the great customer service!",-1
2023-02-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,worst customer service,True,"  Although I presented my air ticket, both printed and the e-version in my phone, as well as proof of payment, I was not allowed to check in because the Spirit Airlines representatives could not find me in their computer system. I ask to see their supervisor and was told they could not reach him by cell phone. Apparently, they had no other means of reaching him? Although I offered to buy another ticket (I had a connecting flight from Fort Lauderdale I wanted to catch), neither of the two representatives were interested in helping me with that, either. This is THE worst customer service I've encountered in my several decades of flying! Never again!",-1

We sat on the plane for an additional 2hrs before our new pilots/crew boarded, we were supposed to land at LAX at 5.40pm originally, we didn’t get to San Pedro until midnight. The flight coming home to SLC from LAX was at 8.40pm and at 10am that morning the delays had already begun, we ended up flying out at 10pm and our brand new luggage was damaged upon arrival kinked handle on one and the others casing was broken in multiple spots also being unable to file a claim for damage because they had no representative available and you only have four hrs after landing to file a claim unless you want to try and prove it a day later going back to the airport. That was our flights. Side note, leaving LAX Spirit had to call security on a guy because he was upset that he had missed both of his connecting flights to get home through Spirit Airlines because both of his incoming flights had been delayed. I don’t understand how this airline is in business.",-1
2023-02-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a joke of an airline,False,  I wish there was a way to give them a worse review. This is a joke of an airline. I hate Spirit Airlines. Absolutely not worth the money in any way whatsoever. Seats are the most uncomfortable. I paid $66 to upgrade because my flight to Dallas was extremely uncomfortable. The first flight they let some short person upgrade for free for no apparent reason and didn't offer upgraded seats to people that actually were uncomfortable. The guy who was upgraded for free claimed he worked for some place and they didn't verify it just gave it to him. This airline will nickel and dime you and then add a fee onto that. Negative 10 is my review. Avoid Spirit at all costs. It's worth it to spend the extra money. This place shouldn't be in business.,-1

When speaking to a representative over the phone, I was told that Spirit would provide overnight accommodations during my overnight layover and I would catch the next available flight. When arriving to the layover destination, I was informed that Spirit Airlines would NOT provide hotel or transportation accommodations. I was stuck for 12 hours between flights and did not receive accommodations after I was told that I would.

2023-02-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Hartford via Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1.0,the worst experience ever,True,  We had the worst experience ever. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure and still missed our flight due to incompetent employees. First we were directed incorrectly to the wrong line so we waited in line twice with 2 kids under the age of 2. Then the employee checking us in didn’t know what she was doing and was chit chatting to her co workers. Then when I tried to speak to a supervisor I was told tell customer service we can’t do anything. We got to the airport at 4am and now we can’t take off until 1pm This is my worst nightmare thanks spirit airlines for making our trip a nightmare.,-1
2023-02-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Seattle via Las Vegas,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,Don't waste your money,False," I had a credit with Spirit Airlines and used it to go to a funeral in Seattle. I had to call to use my credit and told the customer service representative the flight I wanted by the flight number. I went to check in and noticed the flight was booked incorrectly. Instead of arriving at 5:30 pm, the flight was booked to arrive at 11:55 pm. I called to get it corrected and they charged me $100 and said there was nothing they could do. I then filed a complaint which was denied. I then explained it was their customer service person who booked it wrong. They opened an investigation and after 2 weeks found in my favor, but would only refund $50 in a credit for a future flight. I know that $50 will cost me a lot more. I will NEVER book a ticket with them again. Don't waste your money! Horrible Customer Service! Horrible experience!",-1

Airline switched planes, now the seats I paid for became big front seats (not my fault) they left us without seats. Called airline customer service was on hold for over an hour, online chat never returned to Chat after original connection, I finally was put through to a very hard to understand person but she was finial able to help me fix the problem they created, but never finalized in computer. Called back, seats not available they said service person was not authorized to make those changes. When I complained to a ""supervisor"" she said would have to listen to recoded line. But conveniently can't not be heard until the day of return flight. Changed seats to further back in plane and separated from person I was traveling with, They would not refund seat fees or even offer free luggage, only thing I got was one seat upgrade(again separated from other traveler) and a ""we are sorry this happened"" No help truly offered for a problem they created. I am also a travel agent and will never encourage my clients to use this airline as I once did. Zero customer service.",-1

They cancelled my flight home and told me they couldn’t get me home for 3 days. I would have to sleep in the airport. They said because it was due to weather they wouldn’t refund me.

I am a mom and I traveled with a baby who is almost 6 months now, they gave me hard time waiting on my stroller in the airport and I had heavy stuff in my hand plus holding a baby, they did send my bag and when I arrived at Newark they told me my bag coming in a different flight. I had to wait 1 and half hours, and the employee came to me say sorry your bag didn’t arrive. Two days now they telling my bag out for delivery and I never receive.

2023-02-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,False,  Scam airline with deceptive pricing and practices. Purchased 4 seats for two adults and two children. Flew from Orlando to Kansas City with no problem. When we arrived at the airport in Kansas City to fly home the lady at the counter was very rude because apparently they close the counter an hour before the flight leaves and we were unaware. She then proceeded to tell us we had to pay for the two child car seats that are supposed to be free as outlined on their site. She proceeded to tell us that we could pay $158 or miss our flight and said we had 2 min before the computers switched to the next flight. I can only assume they get paid a commission for adding costs to already paid for flights. I will never fly Spirit again. Never.,-1
2023-02-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Boise,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,deceptive in its pricing,True,  Spirit is deceptive in its pricing. Flew first leg via Alaska airlines and it was the expected $30.00 to check a bag with free carryon. Bag limit was 50 pounds. Coming home on Spirit they charge$ 75 per checked bag and $75 for a carry on. Our checked bag was 4 pounds over so yhey charged an additional $69 for the additional 4 pounds. Total of an additional $279 for bags one way. More than the total airline ticket. Very deceptive practice. Never flying spirit again. Beware of the false advertising of low fares.,-1
2023-02-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Puerto Rico,1.0,,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,dissatisfied with this airline,False,"  Flew out to Puerto Rico and everything was fine. On the other hand the flight back I ran into some issues. I purchased a check on bag when processing my flight back. The check on bag did not go through so I had to stand in line for customer service. Once I did that I had to go back to check on bag to get it scanned. After that I stood back in line to check my bag onto the airline. With the amount of time it took they said I can no longer book my flight even though there were 45 minutes left for me to board. They said I did not have time to get on my flight when there was not a single person standing in the customs line. Also, my flight was the first gate after going through customs. After all the issues I had to pay an additional $100 for me to board the next flight which did not leave for another 2 days and I had to stay in Puerto Rico. I have emailed customer service to get some assistance with this and they first responded back in September and I keep reaching out and no one has said anything back with my concerns. At this point I will never book another flight with Spirit Airlines. The response rate and the attentiveness to customers with issues has not been addressed. I have heard multiple people complain about spirit airlines and previously I have not had any issues until now. I am dissatisfied with this airline and I would not recommend it to anyone.",-1
2023-02-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Bogota via Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,experience was an absolute nightmare,False,"  I needed help from spirit airlines customer service. After waiting 10 minutes for a live person to take my call, I explained I needed help paying, before my flight, for one checked bag through the entire outbound flight as well as for the return. Oh boy, the lady at customer service started to read a script, in very poor English, to sell me all kind of stuff that I was not interested in at all, instead of helping me out as a customer to resolve my specific issue. I got no resolution whatsoever. My customer experience was an absolute nightmare. This is my first time flying with spirit airlines and it will certainly be the last. Spirit, never again.",-1
2023-02-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Dallas,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never will I fly with Spirit again,False,  We sat in the plane for 3 1/2 hours at the gate trying to get the engines started. Only once during the ordeal did they come through the cabin to give travelers one small cup of water. Everything else was offered at full price. Finally they announced for everyone to get off the plane and take their belongings. The gate was chaos with no communication about what was going on and the passengers were going all over the terminal not knowing what was going on. Complete confusion and the employees at the gate were saying nothing. We eventually found another airline to get us to our final destination but it cost us 3 x the original price charged by Spirit. We got to our destination 10 hours late. I tried to get ahold of customer service to get a ticket refund but only got an email stating they would not refund us the original ticket price nor reimburse us for the secondary airline who actually flew us. We got coupons for $100 per person for our next Spirit flight. They refused to call and the emails were very slow in coming and ended up giving us nothing. Never will I fly with Spirit again!,-1

That is until they charge you all the additional fees. My flight out was delayed by 8 hours and am currently being delayed on my flight back with a minimum 2 hour delay so far.

Get to the airport and have to pay another $99 for a carry on. $170 for a carry on that is stored above the seats is ridiculous. Spirit is by far more expensive than other airlines. Do your homework. Second time flying with spirit and will be the last. First time the flight attendants were very rude the whole trip yelling at people with a 4 year old. My fault for trying Spirit again. Lesson learned. Tickets may be slightly cheaper but in the end you could get 2 tickets from another airline for less than 1 flight with Spirit.,-1

Spirit called our plane 30 minutes late. We departed roughly 120 minutes late. ""They are loading bags at the moment, e will be ready to leave soon"" What? Crazy.

I was in between airports from 3pm feb 1st till 11am feb 2nd and the airline refused to give me a hotel or food voucher because it was a cancelation and delay due to weather. Instead I got a travel voucher of 50 dollars for my next booking. I refuse to fly spirit again after they failed to resolve my problem which was the sleep deprivation and hunger. Seriously not even a complimentary snack on the flight. I refuse to give that airline any more of my money. Its not the airlines fault there was bad weather its also not my fault that they cancelled my flight when I was already at the airport, they rebooked me on a flight that got delayed, and the connection flight of that rebooking was over 6 hours later. Give me at least a food voucher for my troubles. The customer support is horrible, 2h waiting queues, the customer support number sends you in circles, the automated chat is frustrating and the customer representatives at the gate just kept saying: in an hour, in an hour, in an hour well we left 6 hours later so I guess they were right by the 5th time. Most stressful, infuriating and just straight up unnecessary experience I have ever had the displeasure of having with an airline. Also there is no entertainment unless you pay extra for internet, at least Delta and AAA have TV. Also don't bother complaining to anyone, no one will help you. I give them 1 star because its the lowest you can give but they deserve a category in the negatives.",-1

So far it has added an additional 48 hours to this trip and we have completely missed our conference. There were five of us waiting outside the gate waiting for our boarding zone to be called - it never was.

You get a cheap flight with no leg room, no food or water, ridiculous baggage fees, you probably won't leave on time or arrive on time, the flight attendants will forget the flight number (actually happened), and you will be made to cram your carry on into a metal bin in while 1/3rd of planes passengers grumpily stare at you to prove you don't have to pay $80 to store it in the overhead bin. If you checked a car seat, golf clubs, or skis, then the oversized bagged handler won't be present and you will be required to wait an hour and a half to find a confused employee who has never done the job to pass out people's belongings. This is all expected because when you arrive at your tropical destination you will have an extra $30 to $50 for a massage to forget it all. I am sad to say Spirit will break this deal. If you miss a connecting flight for any reason other than ""mechanical"" they will rebook you for the following day but not provide a hotel, transport, food, or anything else. We missed the last leg of our flight due to a combination of the plane leaving late because they thought everyone boarded and realized a bus of people were still waiting outside, the plane being stuck on the runway because the gate was taken, then Spirit deemed my duffel bag as oversized so it came out 15 mins after all other bags. We were rebooked for 8 hours later left to fend for ourselves with a 10 month old baby at 9pm in the Ft. Lauderdale airport. The only good part of our flight is I can now happily say I will never be on a Spirit plane again.",-1

My flight there was refunded but because the flight home wasn’t I was never refunded. How was I supposed to get there during a Hurricane to even use the flight home? They sent me a credit for a future flight but I have to use it by Feb 6? I’m not a frequent flyer, so I can’t use this. But because their policy states they don’t do refunds in order to keep flights cheap for others they won’t do the right thing and refund me.

When I tried to get on my connecting flight to Salt Lake City, they told me there was an outstanding balance and they would not let me on the plane until it was paid. They said they couldn't remove the $100 fee because a different city applied it, even though my bag fit in the personal size bin. (I have pictures of my item in the bin). Then, on my return flight, I got double charged $80 when checking my bag. I paid $260 for my carry on sized bag and my ticket for me to fly was only $250. This airline stinks!",-1
2023-01-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Middletown via Hartford,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst Airline Service Ever,False," On January 24 I received an email from Spirit Airlines that I need to add bags to save on your flight to Hartford. I did this the same day which cost me $57 dollars. When I arrived to the airport I was told that my bags weighed 46 pounds, (6 pounds over the limit) I asked why did I pay for my bags on line and then have to pay an additional fee. I asked for a $57.00 refund which they did not want to give back to me. I paid the $69 dollars for the 6 pounds over but was not happy. I was a little early for my flight so the woman that was taking care of me told me to have a seat and she would be able to check my bags in 25 minutes. So I took a seat. Coming back after 25 minutes I was ready to have my bags checked. Upon doing so I saw another associate say to a customer that their bag is over two pounds so you might want to take some things out! I questioned the woman that was checking by bags and asked her why I was not offered this and she said the fee was already paid! I asked for a supervisor to help with this situation. I asked the same thing and she said that there was nothing that she could do but give me the card to customer service. Worst Airline Service Ever!",-1

I have never been disgusted by the service, specifically with the staff at the counter in Indianapolis. Rather than being helpful and answer my questions she looked away and after I was insisting on having an explanation why I need to pay additional 99 dollars she looked away and said “you have to pay and if not you are not going in”. I still don’t know what I payed, but on the top of that she humiliated me by not allowing me in until she said so because she thought I was rude to a girl at the counter (not the girl). She was lecturing me on my behavior? I’m not allowed to receive an answer about what and why I’m paying additional 99 dollars? If that was the last airline left on earth I would never use them again.",-1
2023-01-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Ft Lauderdale,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,pay extra for a back pack to carry on,True,"  I understand delays, but was delayed multiple times, approx 7 hours on departing Nashville. Did not realize I needed to pay extra for a back pack to carry on the flight, after paying for checked luggage and a penalty fee for being 3 pounds over at 43 pounds (my bad as I assumed it was 50 pound limit like all other airlines). Paying for my 2 bags and fee for being over was over $175. On return flight from Ft Lauderdale on January 1, 2023, flight was cancelled and no other flight out until noon on January 2nd. I booked on another airline to get home so I could get to work and was told to just submit information on web site for refund. Have been told twice that would have an answer on refund in 5-7 days and now Spirit is saying will have an answer in 30 days. Return flight fare and checked baggage is what I would like refunded. Flight number 0228 from Nashville to Ft Lauderdale- December 27, 2022 cancelled flight from Ft Lauderdale to Columbus Ohio Flight 0492 on January 1, 2023.",-1
2023-01-23,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Orlando,5.0,,5.0,3.0,,3.0,5.0,Our flight went well,True,"  We flew from Charlotte to Orlando and vice versa. We originally didn't pick seats because on an hour flight, we didn't care if we sat together or not. We also only ever do a personal carry-on, which is free. Sizes seemed smaller this time, but our bags are small for such a short trip. Then, a couple of days before the flight out, I got an email about seat bidding. I took the plunge and got the big front seats for a really cheap price. Loved it. It was very comfortable. I am not large, so it was very roomy. Charlotte to Orlando went well. Everyone got loaded as they should. Flight-crew was friendly. Orlando to Charlotte was a different story. This was the only gripe I had. The PASSENGERS on our return trip would not let correct zones board as they should. So by the time we got on the plane, the overhead bins above our seats were full. WHY were people putting bags in the bin over the first two rows of seats when their seats were further back on the plane? It's ok, though, because I was able to cram our small bags on top of the ones already there. In the front seat, there is no seat in front to store personal items under, which is where everyone is supposed to put their personal item carry-on. I think the airline should reserve some space in the bin over the first row just for the first row to use. Lots of flight attendants on the return flight home too. In flight entertainment listening to them chat about their lives. I checked my email after returning home and noticed they had offered vouchers for volunteers for the return flight to take a different flight. Our flight went well.",1

Don’t recommend at all.",-1
2023-01-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,flight crew who laughed about it,False,"  As I write this review, everyone is being asked to leave the airplane. The AC is not working on the plane, and they are working on it. Expected time of plane being fixed; there isn’t one. No regard to those who have a connecting flight. No regard to those who are older or those with disabilities. In fact, just a flight crew who laughed about it. Absolutely disgusted with Spirit Airlines! And I only gave a one star, because it wouldn’t let me give zero stars.",-1
2023-01-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Sacramento,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,told it’s not paid for,False,"  My plane was grounded due to mechanical problems and they couldn’t book me another flight until two days later. They didn’t take my suitcase off the plane, so it went two days ahead of me and luckily was waiting for me in Sacramento California when I got there. Also when my reservations were made I had to pay $47 to reserve my seats and $65.00 for my suitcase. Then when I’m ready to fly home to Ohio I go to check my suitcase in and I’m told it’s not paid for. I said I paid $65. When my reservations were made. He tells me that was just for the flight here. So in my opinion, Spirit sucks. Along with these problems you are crammed in the plane like sardines and the seats are not comfortable in the least bit. They don’t even recline at all. Never again will I fly with Spirit. No way.",-1

2023-01-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never again!,True,"  I purchased my tickets online for $573.36 Leave on 1/1/2023 From PNS to Orlando MCO to Kansas. Return on 1/5/2023 from Kansas to MCO to Pensacola. On 1/1/2023 I got four messages that my reservation has been delayed. It was 2 hours delayed then I missed connecting flight in Orlando. The supervisor at customer service  was picking up two customers from different lines at the same time and she is so disrespectful, rude, and unprofessional. She was yelling at me trying to force me to accept a flight on 1/2/23 9:45 pm departure from Orlando to Kansas that 24 hours more waiting time. I knew there were American and Southwest Airlines flights available the next morning but she refused to me. She treated me unfairly and disrespected that’s how much she cares about business. I went to another customer service and tried getting a morning ticket then she stopped her help me out. I spent over $400 dollars (one way) on a new flight with Southwest Airlines departure at 7:25 am the next morning on 1/2/2023. So Orlando wasn’t my destination and the flight was 2 hours delayed that wasn’t my fault. I was staying at Orlando airport overnight without a hotel. After I canceled it and they still charged me $319.18 then refund $254.18 only. This is the most ripped-off airline business I ever experienced. Never again!",-1
2023-01-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to St. Thomas,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst airline I've ever flown,False," This is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown! In the future, I will re-schedule my vacation if my only option to fly is Spirit. The seats are uncomfortable, bottle water on the flight is $4, there is no in-flight entertainment on an international flight and I haven't spoken to a single employee who's been friendly or helpful. However, I guess if I worked for such a horrible airline I'd probably be grumpy too. A week prior to our trip we called to pay our bag fees since the website says it'll cost more if you wait until the day you travel. We had to pay $375 for 2 checked bags and the 2 standard carry-on bags (1 backpack each). Outrageous! When arriving to the airport the check in line was very long, so we decided to try and utilize one of the self-service Kiosks to check in. I went through the whole Kiosk menu and it suddenly shut down. I tried again and got all the way to the part where I was going to pay an additional fee for a bag that was 5 lbs overweight and the machine quit again. Finally, we just stood in the line and checked in. A couple days later I looked at my credit card account to find that I'd been charged $366 for bag fees at that kiosk, in addition to the $375 we'd already paid by phone. Once we came home from our vacation (flew back American), I called Spirit to see if, by some small miracle, I might be able to get the $366 refunded. That was a joke. I spoke to the first person on the phone who didn't know what a Kiosk was and he kept putting me on ""a short 1-2 minute hold"" and then would come back on the phone and couldn't answer a single question. He first tried telling me that it actually costs the $741 that we paid to check 2 bags, and then he finally told me that since we actually took the flight then there was nothing he could do to refund our money. I spoke to someone else and was told the same thing. What does having already taken the flight matter to receive a refund when you've been overcharged?? I asked if they could see the 2 bag charges and they both answered yes, but because we already took the flight then they could do nothing to refund me. There were 3 other couples who traveled with us and they were all very disappointed due to their own issues and struggles with the airline and all said they'd never fly Spirit again.",-1
2023-01-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Never flying Spirit again,True,"  Complete waste of money. After checking a bag it would have cost the same as flying Delta. Also, the pilot decided to leave early on our way to the destination, but my son wasn’t able to make the next flight and make it to his competition in time, so his dad ended up driving. Of course Spirit Airlines can’t do anything about it in regards to a refund or anything. I attempted on the way back, and they even had a larger flight due to overbooking and was willing to give my seat up with the hopes I can get some type of credit back. But not only did I NOT receive a refund or anything for my sons flight, they ended up giving both his and my seat away. There is currently someone else who paid for my original seat in row D and now I’m I’m the last row because he was a minor and needed to stay with his family. Never flying Spirit again. It’s not even worth the hassle and super disorganized as a company altogether.",-1

2023-01-16,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Orlando,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3.0,charged me $200 for 2 bags,False,  On Saturday January 14th me and my daughter flew from Houston to Orlando. The bags that I used is the bags that I've always used and was never charged because it fits in the personal item compartment at the airport. On this particular one if the ticket agents called me up while the plane was boarding and told me I needed to pay for bags. I was shocked because I had no other luggage and like I said I've used such luggage before. I then proceeded to ask if its not classified as a personal item and she smiled with a smirk saying no! They charged me $200 for 2 bags at gate that is considered personal. I watched this same lady be rude to other travelers as well. One girl had a Walmart size plastic bag with shoes and they was making her to pay. There was also another lady with a little back pack and a duffle bag that they made stuff in her bag which was later taken out once on plane. I'm not satisfied with this because I should not have been charged and definitely will be going further with this. I dnt know if she was money hungry or just plain out miserable but I will never fly with this airline again.,-1

This is perhaps the worst airlines in the United States. We left Las Vegas an hour and a half late. Once we arrived in Los Angeles our flight so far has been delayed over two hours. The crew has yet to apologize for the delay and no concessions were made. The tickets are inexpensive, but they charge for everything!! You are allowed one small piece of luggage that can fit under a seat. All other luggage is a minimum of sixty dollars. Additional weight past forty pounds is an additional bag charge. Drinks, water, snacks and alcoholic beverages carry steep prices. I am so disappointed with this terrible service. I would not recommend this airline for anything other than someone who has no timetable, no luggage and does not want anything on the plane.",-1

This is my first time booking directly with them. 1st time in October 2022. Little seats. Bring Neck pillow. No leg room. I kept getting a cramp for a 4.5 hrs flight. Pay for everything, bags $$$, wifi $, snacks and drinks $$. Good for cheap, short flight with only the free carry-on. On 1/6/2023 I purchased my tickets online for $448- Leave on 1/11/2023 From BWI to ATL to New Orleans. Return on 1/15/2023 New Orleans to Florida to BWI. On 1/8/2023 around 6 am to find an email that my reservation has been canceled. I call Spirit and customer service told me I canceled it at 1 o'clock that morning and they issued a refund for $186-. I told her I was sleeping at that time and someone on their end made a mistake. I was then told she would send a request to have it investigated which take 7-10 days. I informed her my trip was in 3 days and they needed to expedite this request. I've called and did the Spirit chat with no success. On 1/10/2023 I was told I could purchase another ticket at the now price of $547.36if I wanted to make that trip. Here I am 2 hrs before my trip and no word.

I’ve stated before that I will only fly Spirit on flights under 4 hours and on the Big Front Seat. At the time of this review the plane had been in service for only 9 months and it looked and felt brand new, the wifi onboard worked great for the entire flight up to 10 minutes before landing and the price compared to other competitors was very good. Under $10.00 for almost 4 hours. I really have nothing negative to say. Fast, efficient, friendly and safe. I wish more travelers would leave positive reviews, Spirit is pretty upfront about their pricing, I saved almost $200 on this ticket compared to legacy carriers. Great job Spirit!",1
2023-01-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Portland,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Awful, awful experience",False,"  This is the second nightmare I have had through Spirit airlines. The first was when they canceled flights my dad had bought 6 months in advanced so that we could have one last family trip before my sister went to the military. They canceled the flights 2 weeks before the trip for no apparent reason and did not help at all with getting the new flights. He ended up paying an extra 1000$ in order to get the flights again and throughout the whole customer service time, they had no regard for how this affected my family. I should have never bought tickets through Spirit knowing that happened but it was the most convenient for my most recent flight. I landed in Portland, waited an hour and and a half for my checked bag just for them to tell me it never got on the plane in Salt Lake City. I filed a claim right then and there because they will just lose the bag if you don't. No word from the claim, just kept telling me they couldn't find my bag. I went back and forth on the phone, got interrupted multiple times when trying to explain my situation, and got sent to a phone number that put me on hold for 20 minutes, then told me to leave a message. I couldn't even leave a message because the message box was full. Figures. I finally get a call from a No Caller ID number. I don't answer those but I read the voicemail and it said my bag was at PDX. Awesome news, but guess what, I couldn't call back to schedule a time to get my bag because it was a No Caller ID number. So I go to PDX in the middle of the day and of course no representative is there. They are only there a couple hours out of the day apparently. Great. I look up arriving flights and get to PDX and finally get my bag but if I didn't know that I could do that, it could've been an even bigger headache. You could not pay me to fly with Spirit again. Awful, awful experience.",-1
2023-01-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,True,"  If I could give Spirit negative 5 stars I would. They not only overcharged us for the luggage. We paid for bags before getting to the airport. Then they charged us an astronomical amount for a carryon, then had the audacity to misplace our luggage due to issues with TSA in Orlando. Then when we finally got to Logan airport there was no one available to open the office so we could get our bags. My granddaughter has no winter clothes to wear because they are in our suitcases and it’s 35 degrees outside. The day we arrived it was snowing. This is unacceptable. Why are you charging so much for bags and you can even pay one person to stand at the airport to open the door for people. Worst experience ever. 3 days later and 3 hrs on the phone 7 numbers dialed plus the message chat option and there’s no direct number that anyone answers. I just kept getting hung up on.",-1

First trip will be my last. Boarded our first flight at 9:30 AM and didn’t take off till 11, which meant we missed our connection flight. They didn’t have a flight for us until the next day, but our bags went ahead of us so now we’re stranded overnight without our luggage. They put us in a hotel which is the absolute least they could do, certainly didn’t do anything to rectify the situation like say, refund at least a portion of our money for the inconvenience. Every single employee we talked to was unhelpful or rude or dismissive, didn’t even bother trying to help us or apologizing. Customer service is non-existent.

The counter in Chicago was unable to help. The spirit airlines telephone number refuse to help as well. They act like it is impossible to modify the reservation after it is made.

I was in hold for 4 hours. I attempted again with their chat line, another hold for 7 hours. I was going to cancel the flight I bought for my elderly couple aunt and uncle. I couldn't get a hold of anyone. I then called their hotline number, another hold. When I finally talked to a person, they wouldn't refund the tickets I bought because 24 hours had already passed. Of course they waited for 24 hours to pass before they picked up my call. Since I couldn't cancel I went ahead and kept it the way it was. My aunt and uncle stayed at a hotel in Orange county for one night since their flight leaves at 6:45 a.m. on Tuesday (Jan 3, 2023). At around 7:45 p.m. on Monday night, I received an email from spirit airlines stating that their flight is cancelled, with no explanation. So I called and asked to get a refund for the tickets, seats, luggage, and insurance we purchased. They would only refund the initial tickets that I bought. The rest would be airlines credit. Since I have NO plans on dealing with this airlines for my future travels. Do yourself a favor and save yourself money and major headache, do not do any business with this airline. They have very poor customer service, and you're not saving any money for purchasing their tickets because they are going to charge you seats, carry-on luggage, and insurance.

Flights are almost always delayed which in consequence will make you miss your flight to your final destination. Talking to customer service or any employee at the airport is pointless. Airport staff do not have the skills nor use appropriate language when engaging in a conversation with a customer. They should learn from Chick fil. A company that is always packed but manages to have a staff that looks sharp, diligent and respectful. On the other hand, Spirit Airlines Staff clearly does not have any sense of empathy nor understanding for costumer needs. Paying premium will not make a difference if your flight is delayed or cancelled. You think you are saving money but the cost of hours lost in the airport, food & hotels will overweight economic air tickets. I will never fly with this airline.",-1

Not just because of a delay. It’s really about customer service. Spirit Airlines has the worst customer service I have ever seen. This is from the ticket agents in Los Angeles to the flight attendants to the management to the corporate offices. Horrible. From beginning to the bitter end. They are liars. They use profanity. They could not possibly care less about the people that fly with them. First and last time to fly with Spirit. They told us that our flight was delayed for 3 days because they didn’t have flight attendants to work, but offered zero compensation which is not in keeping with their own policies, etc. We had to pay out of pocket and they offered zero options. They were so disrespectful, rude, unprofessional and showed us how much they care about our business. We believe them. Do yourselves a favor. Pay more and use another airline.",-1
2023-01-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,probable delays and cancellations,False," Only worth it if you can accept the risk of probable delays and cancellations and are planning on bringing nothing but a bag you can put under the seat. Expect long lines at check in, the airline does not put sufficient staff on the schedule leading to massive check in lines. These lines do start moving quickly when more staff arrives in response to long line length. But it wouldn't be a problem if the staff would just be there from the start. $99 to bring an instrument on the plane because it ""takes overhead bin space"" which it does, but the overhead space was not in short supply, every other airline can handle carry ons without an absurd price gouge. I had to cancel this trip and rebook it for reasons unrelated to the airline. The cancelation fee on Spirit's website for within a week of departure is listed as $99, and this would be taken off a flight credit that would be given in your name. In reality the fees ended up being closer to $150 and the flight credit has to be used in three months. Finally bags were slow to arrive at claim. Flight crew does their job and offered an apology for the delays but this does not come close to making up for the terrible experience I had on this airline. Spirit is not a budget airline, they price gouge you at every opportunity for things considered standard at every other airline. This is so they can trap you with a tempting inexpensive fair but ensure that most customers pay as much as any other flight would cost.",-1

I am a student and three to five time a year to and from school. I also like to go on vacation to destinations that require a flight on my time off.  Spirit airlines is the only airlines that has a weight limit of 40lb for a checked bag not to mention each checked bag cost more then $60. The customer service is the worst at Spirit airlines, no one was helpful. When I asked for a manager the attendant walked behind the counter for a few minutes and came back alone and said that we would need to talk to the airline that booked our flight. I finally gave up on receiving any help and I told the attendant that this will be the last time I will fly with Spirit. She literally laugh in my face and said ""you are not the only one to say that. We have thousands of customers."" Spirit airlines employees do not care about keeping customer or about their customers in general. While checking in our bags I looked around and saw more than 50 customers who were also having a terrible time dealing with Spirit airlines and their employees. Spirit airlines is the worst airline to fly with or deal with. I would not recommend Spirit airlines to my worst enemy and as promised I will never book a Spirit airlines ticket again, even if it's the only available flight to my destination.",-1

Flight from Texas to Nevada was ok except for the more than $200 surprise fees for the bags. I kind of blame Priceline for booking us on an airline that charges crazy bag fees. There goes any savings plus some. Then while sitting for 2 hours at the Las Vegas airport, 15 minutes before our flight they cancel it, to let our pilot go to a different plane. All passengers had to go stand in line for hours to try to get another flight. We couldn't get out till the next day. We booked at a different airline and got out within 2 hours (Allegiant). Spirit would not do that for us. They would rather pay $150 for a hotel without our luggage. The following day, when our Spirit flight was suppose to land, we went to the airport in Sacramento to pick up our luggage we found only one. They told us there was no room for the other two. We have to make a report and they will notify us when they find them. Most of the people were nice but the airline decision makers are a joke. NEVER again and I sure hope people don't trust them or Priceline. We saved nothing, spent so much more and stressed for days.",-1

That flight was canceled 2 hours before the flight. No reason was given. I went to customer service the lady had an attitude and offered me a flight to Orlando on 02/01/2023, which is a layover, and leaving Orlando on the 03/01/2023, which I declined since I’m traveling with my 11-year-old daughter. Then she put me on standby on the 11:40 flight NK1004, which changed gates every half hour. I have an email as proof. My daughter and I had already boarded that plane but were kicked out because the late people showed up. My checked bags went to Philadelphia because they failed to take my bags off the plane. The lady that kicked us out of the plane and the lady at the counter was so mean and unprofessional that I was cursed at in front of my daughter. I went to customer service again, asking for my money back since I never asked for the Orlando flight, and after the way, I was treated, I do not want to deal with spirit anymore. I was told I could not get my money since I had a flight booked for the 02/01/2023, a flight I declined.

2022-12-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline I have ever flown,False,"  I flew from DTW to LAX on Thursday, December 29, 2022, with Spirit Airlines. I checked two bags and was charged a $70 fee for having slightly over the desired amount. I paid for it and didn't even try to fight it as I had just waited almost 1 hour and a half in line for baggage claim. That isn't my concern. I tried reaching out to their customer service department to seek a refund for the $70 and $38.14 because my new underwear was still in its box having never been opened. Was taken out of my suitcase. No note, ticket, or card in my suitcase indicated that someone had even opened my suitcase. No email. No text. No notifications whatsoever. I was also told that there's nothing that they can do, which is incorrect. I was also given a phone number to call baggage in Detroit where I was put on hold and then hung up on four times. I am disgusted by how this is being handled.  This makes me extremely hesitant to ever fly with Spirit again, as I have difficulty trusting that all items in my luggage will make it to the destination. Save yourself the money and the headache, and do not fly Spirit Airlines. They trick you into thinking their flights are cheap but by the time you get all the way done with Spirit you might as well just fly another airline because you're going to spend a lot of money for absolutely nothing with Spirit. The Wi-Fi is a joke and doesn't even work. Their seats are super uncomfortable and they do not even have any form of entertainment to assist with long flights.

After 2.5 hours in line to rebook my flight, I was told the earliest would be 3 days later, December 31st and I wouldn’t arrive until 12:30 New Years night. Luckily I’m with my family who can drive me and house me. As for everyone who had to Uber there, back, and there again, they also have no help for housing compensation. So good luck figuring out what to for the next 3 days until your next flight. If you’d like a refund you can do that and chose another airline ticket for over $1,000 on such short notice. I sure hope you had no plans for New Years or the next 3 days. I sure hope hotels are free too. What’s even better is I was able to book a flight from the same airline on the 30th while in line so they were still selling tickets, thank god I did. It only cost me an extra 150$ to be forced to travel 2 days later. Thanks Spirit! Oh yea, no free water of course, duh.",-1

But the overall way that Spirit Airlines treated hundreds of passengers on Dec 26 in Orlando is absolutely sickening. After canceling multiple flights, some even international. The airline refused to compensate for any inconvenience at all. Only offering to refund the flight that was canceled or help book a new flight which in most cases was days away without any support to hospitality or housing. I have seen some horrible customer service but watching someone in a supervisor position personally tell passengers that they are incapable of understanding the reason for their inconvenience and telling them to just go away is a new one. Waiting over 6 hours in a service line to be told that there nothing that can be done is absolutely demoralizing. And with it being holiday week, there are few options available for lodging. As of this review me and my wife who were connecting flight to Cancun for our honeymoon are started in a 2 star hotel on Orlando spending egregious amount of money to try and just make it back home since our trip ultimately ruined due to lack of available flights.",-1

Lost luggage, discomfort, additional expense, poor customer service if “customer service” is even what one can term it. Altogether more of a failed attempt at a joke than an actually functioning commercial airline establishment. The details really are insignificant here - I’m spending my own time writing this review not out of malice, or vindictiveness; but rather out of concern for my fellow human : DO NOT expect that your discounted ticket will actually result in discount. The expense is hidden - the fees are crazy, and the service has been decried in the preceding paragraph. Use one of the Big 4. In the end it’s cheaper.

I would take Spirit because of its low-cost, but still gawked at how they won't even give you a cup of water. I think I have finally reached my breaking point with them after this last experience, however. I checked my bag for a flight on Christmas Eve, which was cancelled. They said they could not book me or anyone on the flight until five days later, at which point, I cancelled my entire trip to see my family for the holidays. What's  worse they have my luggage and I can't figure out how to get it back. They called me in the yesterday evening (finally) and left a voicemail that said to call them between 8AM and 6PM the next day. I have called the number that called me, I have called the main Spirit Airlines customer service line, and I have called the Austin Airport all multiple times. I cannot get through to anybody. The phone perpetually rings and rings, unless it doesn't - in which case, the call just disconnects. I tried to leave a recorded message with feedback in a survey; when I pressed pound to signal that I was done, it said: ""Sorry there has been an error, call back later!"" and hung up. My tips for travelling with this airline: 1. Do not check luggage with this airline. 2. Do not book flights with this airline if the trip has necessity of happening, whether it be for work or family-related. 3. If you are taking this flight for something time-sensitive, you should leave several days ahead of time, in case the flight gets cancelled.",-1

We were supposed to fly to Miami from Baltimore to catch a cruise the next day with Carnival. Just as we pulled into long term parking, we received a text from Spirit telling us our flight was canceled. We went into the airport to speak with an agent because there was an hour and a half wait by phone to talk to someone. Four people were working the counters (really only 2 were working while 2 other employees stood around talking to friends or just random people standing around). Three hours in line later, we finally got to the counter, only to be told they could not help us arrange other flights or do anything at all for us except give us a refund. Meanwhile, a female employee was berating another woman being helped near us and a shouting match ensued, while a call for bag check-ins to people with a flight in Vegas meant those people were cutting in line of those waiting to hear about their canceled flights. It was absolute chaos and just the most ridiculous thing ever. Needless to say, we missed our flight and therefore our cruise as we could not get any other flight out. We could have driven, but due to the amount of time wasted there, we would not have arrived in time to catch the ship. Stay away from these losers, the absolute worst in the business.

Perfect weather and no explanation. So we have to guess why. They can't get employees to show up for work? They don't pay them enough? Do their planes need servicing?

2022-12-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Atlantic City to Fort Meyers,,,,,,1.0,1.0,currently driving 18 hours to Florida,True,"  This is the first review I have ever felt the need to write. Today is Christmas Day, and instead of getting to spend it with Family and friends, I was forced to spend it in an airport the entire day. My flight was scheduled to leave from the Atlantic City Airport at 10:30 today. This airport is entirely run by Spirit airlines and spirit airlines alone. When it was 10:30, the passengers waiting to board were told that there was a delay. The reason for the delay was that “three flight attendants weren’t there”. Because of this, the plane couldn’t leave. They told us there was an hour delay, which turned into two hours, and eventually we were told that we were “for certain leaving at 3:10. No sooner, no later”. The airline then canceled the flight after ours which was also headed for Fort Myers so that those staff could come on our plain instead. We waited a total of 5 hours until 3:00, which was supposed to be when we left “no sooner, no later” when they announced that the flight was cancelled. Instead of telling everyone that the flight was canceled at 10:30, they made us wait 5 hours and lied to us and ruined everyone’s Christmas. Missing three flight attendants is not a staff issue. It was not the staffs fault. This was a management planning issue. Whoever was in charge of the planning of this flight should be fired immediately not because of the fact that they messed up, but because of the fact that they lied to all the passengers and made us wait for 5 hours for no reason on Christmas.

Upon calling customer service for help: - with alternate flights: they are ready to provide only through their airline and the earliest is Dec 30. Even after multiple requests they are not willing to consider alternate airlines. With help on refunds for the rest of my trip aspects they flatly refused, saying it is beyond their control. They aren't even willing to send an email stating they cannot make alternate flight arrangements until Dec 30. One of the agents directed me to their chat agent, assuring it was an actual agent while this was an automated bot for standard refunds. Upon asking to connect to a supervisor, three times they put on a 1 hour hold, I had no option but to disconnect Will never consider this airline for my travel.",-1
2022-12-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Terrible organization,False,"  Terrible organization. We arrived for a flight out of Columbus after all the winter weather had passed and thought we were in the clear as other airlines were flying. They plane had been sitting all day ready to go and was fueled up. Our bags on the tarmac ready to be loaded, but never happened. We sat at our gate for an hour and a half. Multiple people went up to ask what was going on and none of the employees had an answer at all. Then out of the blue canceled the flight. Might I remind you that it is sunny and 20 degrees in Columbus and 67 and sunny in Vegas. No weather between the two. By the time we knew the flight was canceled we had no time to get a flight. We are out thousands of dollars thanks to the stupidity of this airline. Never gave us any option for any kind of travel to make it up. Pretty much just shut and and take the refund. Terrible organization and I highly suggest you pick another airline to fly. Never will even think to ever fly spirit.",-1

I am still in the airport and this is not the end. I have to stay another couple hours in here. The reason is I’m sitting here because the pilot arrived 2 hours late then the airplane should have departed. Around 300 people were waiting in the airport for him. When we arrived to the Orlando we of course missed our connection plane. They said they were late because of the weather but the weather was perfectly fine. No compensation no excuses and this is now how I’m spending my Christmas having to wait 10 hours for the next plane to come and actually bring me to Santo Domingo. I was supposed to arrive there at 2 pm. I am now going to be arriving at 1 am at night.,-1
2022-12-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Houston,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,asking questions is prohibited,True,"  Most worst service, rude/unprofessional staff, full of arrogance, no customer service, flight was deliberately delayed more than 3 hours in top of that they made us seat inside the plane almost an hour prior flying. They will provide different timings for the flights to book, however they won't depart flight on time. For example: if you book 17:50 which will never fly in time. It will fly around 21:00. They attract passenger to book 17:50 flight time but they will never take off on time . When raised the concern staff became rude and then another guy come to me and said can I have word with you he thought I would resist to come out from plane which I didn't, I went outside while plane was still waiting to be repaired as per staff. I went outside spoke to guy and soon he realised I am not from USA and I was calm talking to him with confidence, he then apologised. What they were trying to show that, if you say something they will escort you out from the plane. I came back within 5 minutes inside the plane. They were trying to show off that raising concern or asking questions is prohibited. Spirit just wants you to put your head down and do not raise concerns. I would never ever use Spirit Airlines service and highly recommend not to use Spirit.",-1

Charged me a ridiculous amount of money to fly with a bag and also disrespected me at the gate when attempting to pay for said bag. Also charged me literally the original price of flight when I wanted to change my date by simply a few days. Not worth your time in any way, it will probably cost you more than any reputable airline.

You think the tickets would be cheaper considering the horrible service you receive. The seats in the aircraft are like sitting on cement and employees sit in the back discussing everything about their lives loudly, I might add.

You are faced with either pay the charge or don't get on the plane. I paid the charge. Got home and disputed the charge. They disputed back and won of course. I'm sure as I read here that it happens every day. NEVER AGAIN to this guy. I will not deal with liars & thieves. Spirit Airlines is a big fat 0 on my scale of 1 to 10.

This isn't one of those things to ignore. This company will charge extra at check-in.  Upon already paying for a bag online when I purchased my flight, at check-in it stated I had no bag so I had to pay $80 for a check-in bag. Spirit bag allowance is 40 lbs so if you go over even by one pound, the check-in representatives will charge you - $100 on top of your $80 bag. It will not be cheaper with Spirit.

On the return trip however, we were told that we either had to pay $99 for a carry on or we couldn't board the plane, same bag, same size. Pretty sleezy thing to do to my autistic daughter.

While the other companies charge $30 per checked bag (and offer a free carry on bag), Spirit charges more than $60 per checked bag + a ridiculous price for the carry on bag (it is not free). I paid $128 for my small carry on plus one checked bag. This was my first and last time traveling with this company.

2022-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to US Virgin Islands,1.0,,5.0,,,2.0,2.0,absolutely no human assistance,False," 2 part review: The actual flight and travel was decent. Seats are small, to be expected. No big deal. It was only a 2 hour or so flight, so we dealt with that. The price for the tickets made that worth it. HOWEVER: Customer service is non existent. Our return flight was cancelled, and we had to rebook, sorry no flights the next day. No flights returning for 6 days!! We had to rebook with another carrier. I just need an email saying why the flight was cancelled so I can get reimbursed from my travel insurance. THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE PERSON AT SPIRIT AIRLINES TO TALK TO, AND NO ONE WHO WILL SEND ME AN EMAIL WITH THE EXPLANATION! If you dont mind that you are dealing with a computer bot to buy a ticket, and anticipate absolutely no issues with any part of your journey, then go with this company that is probably run by a little kid in a basement, with absolutely no human assistance for their customers what so ever. Going forward, I will NEVER use them again, and will gladly pay double just to go with a company who actually had people working there who will assist their paying customers",-1

Upon arriving to the airport to check in the luggage for my sister I noticed a total chaos, the kiosks were not working and the person directing the people to make a line was really unpolite, yelling to everybody. The process was too slow that my sister lost her flight and they told her to rebook. The next flight available was 5 days later.

Lowest luggages weight limit of any airline I have previously flown. Bought chocolate box from gift shop next to gate, which was given to me in a plastic bag; Spirit Airlines wanted to charge me $99 for an additional “luggage” for this plastic bag. No food is served on this 5 hour flight, not even for purchase. I had to pay $89 for 1 checked in bag (vs $35 what most airlines charge). Will never fly Spirit again.",-1

2022-12-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Los Angeles,,,,,,1.0,1.0,refused to let me on the flight,True,"  On November 9th, 2022 I was due to fly from Cancun, Mexico back home to Los Angeles, CA. When I arrived at the Spirit Airlines gate they asked for passports. I provided my valid valid Canadian passport which I flew in from. The customer service agents refused to let me on the flight due to me not having a valid US passport. They told us that they couldn’t allow me into the United States and that we needed to go to the US Embassy in Mexico in order to start the application process for a new US passport, which would take many days as-well as many accommodations to ensure our safety and comfortability in a country other than our own. The gate agents told us they called Homeland security to try to “push it through” after I had given them a valid Canadian passport, SSC card, Consular report of born birth abroad citizenship given to me by the US government, as-well as a California drivers license, where i have lived and worked for the last 3 years. The gate agents specifically told me I was not allowed to fly out of this country, back into my home country which is absurd and is not taking into consideration the safety and integrity of customers. You expected both a US/Canadian Citizen to miss their flight home and make their own accommodations in a different country. We had to spend an additional $500 on flights from Cancun to Toronto in order to ensure our own safety and remove ourselves from being stranded. From Toronto, we had to book a $300 hotel for the night, as-well as food. We also went ahead and booked an additional $1300 in flight cost to get ourselves back to the United States. This was over a month ago with no response from spirit airlines whatsoever.",-1

Spirit decided to change my flight multiple times after I paid making me arrive at my destination more than 6 hours later than what I paid for. After waiting for ~7 hours to get connected to chat support they offered to cancel and refund my ticket instead of offering partial refund or voucher due to this inconvenience/delay. On the flight back they delayed the departure time twice to a total of 1hour and 10min. After arriving at the airport, they changed departure back to only 30min late making many people nearly miss the flight. In flight, they have broken seats (e.g. many without armrest) that are very uncomfortable. They also do not offer anything for free even basic survival goods such as tap water on a 4hour + flight. These reasons make me gladly pay more to other airlines for being recognized as a human being.",-1
2022-12-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlantic City to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again,True," This is the worst airline I have ever experienced. I had a flight from Atlantic City to Orlando departing at 5.40am. I was already checked in and my bags were paid for. Upon my arrival I was told my flight was cancelled and they put me on a 12pm flight. While I'm sitting in the departure lounge I realized my old flight number was on display at one of the gates and people were sitting waiting for the flight. I headed back to the check in counter to the same person who'd checked me in before and asked why she put me on a different flight if my flight was delayed and not cancelled? She could not answer and the supervisor took over. Although I was put back on my original flight, the flight did not leave until 11.15am (6 hours delayed). I had another flight to catch in Orlando to head home to Trinidad which was departing at 2.25pm which meant I had to check in by 1.00pm for the latest. This is why I made sure to purchase an early ticket into Orlando. Of course I missed my flight home. I'm now alone in Orlando with my daughter helping from home in Trinidad. There were no other flights out from Orlando to Trinidad like I mentioned before so she had to 1) book me in the hotel in the Orlando airport 2) buy another Spirit flight from MCO to FLL 3) buy another ticket from FLL to POS (Trinidad) which by the way the only flight was a week away 4) Had to figure out my accommodation for another week. All of the above we had not financially been able to plan for putting my daughter and I in extreme expense. It is unacceptable to do this to people this especially at Christmas time, you take customers money knowing fully well you are not fully staffed, have disgruntled check-in staff, put people in expense and get off scotch free while we are now left in debt because of your incompetence. I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again.",-1
2022-12-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this was just pure incompetence,False,"  Our flight was delayed even though our physical plane was at the airport. The workers at the gate would not tell us the actual reason why but it was because they didn't have a pilot and one was late coming in, because apparently the pilot who flew our plane in couldn't fly us out? How Spirit didn't plan to have a pilot ready for the flight that was supposed to be flying out at 8.58pm is beyond me but what is more beyond me is the fact that they boarded us and then kept us waiting on the plane for more than an hour, after already delaying us by almost 3 hours, because once again they were waiting on the pilot who was late. They boarded us before the pilot was there to fly the plane, and once he did arrive we were informed we'd be waiting even longer because the co-pilot had flown too many hours and could not fly on our flight so Spirit had to scramble to get a new co-pilot in. Spirit knew, or should have known, that the co-pilot would no be able to fly and instead of using the 3+ hours they delayed us to secure a new co-pilot they just made us sit on the plane for even longer. The absolute mismanagement and ineptitude of this airline and this flight is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. And this is not even mentioning how our flight down was delayed by 5 hours because they had to fly a part in from Orlando (a 2 hour flight max) and all they gave us in return was $7 for food at the airport. I had always heard about how bad Spirit was but until now I had always had good experiences with them but that feeling has gone right out the window. I could understand if the flight was delayed for bad weather but this was just pure incompetence.",-1
2022-12-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,their website is misleading,True,"  Spirit Airline worked with Priceline to have a bundle package including air ticket, rental car, and hotel. However, Spirit asked you to buy carry-on or check-in bags which is normal for cheap flights. However, their website is misleading you to buy Save$ club membership without a clear statement that will charge you ~$90. After I found out and cancelled my flights from Priceline. Spirit just cancelled everything including Save$ club membership. Their customer service will reply you with bunch information without directly answer your questions. I would never take a flight via this company anymore.",-1
2022-12-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Bogota,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2.0,a nightmare to deal with,False,  Spirit is a nightmare to deal with. They do not have customer service anywhere (try to talk to someone at your airport and they refer you to a mysterious 800 number that gives you the runaround with robots until they hang up on you.) I bought round trip tickets and missed the first flight because my partner had a seizure at the airport and they did nothing to help me or refund me my money. Instead they tried to upsell me on new tickets. Horrible company and horrible people.,-1
2022-12-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,,,,,,,1.0,cancelled 5 hours before departure,True,"  Everybody who has a chance to choose any other airline please do so. I got my flight cancelled 5 hours before departure. This led to me having to buy a new flight for the night, a $120 dollar uber since I missed my ride, and I missed all my college classes the next day. So because they cancelled the flight, I got about $500 dollars worth of additional cost. They promised to pay back for only the cancelled flight and gave me a pathetic $50 voucher that has to be used in 90 days. I tried to explain to their customer service that I would need a reasonable refund but their responses were like talking to a child.",-1

Baggage claim was a total nightmare! The Spirit manager did not even know our flight had arrived until 1.5 hours later. Still no bags. Apparently they decided to wait until a delayed flight from Las Vegas showed up to unload both planes at once. The manager didn't want to deal with angry customers so she and 2 other employees hid behind a locked door! Even when it was knocked on repeatedly by Spirit customers. Never again will I use this company.,-1

Every time I promise myself I'll never fly Spirit again. Today I was in line to board, while my husband was in the restroom, and someone with Spirit randomly stopped me because I had two personal bags. She demanded to see my ticket, scanned it, and told me I need to pay for a carry on. I told her my husband was in the restroom, but she had me step out of line and wouldnt give me back my ticket until he was there.

The Attendant was rude in an already stressful situation but things should have gone quickly because i already paid for everything including baggage prior and have been told that I don’t need to pay for baggage during check in.  Long story short i ended up paying around $950 total for baggage which is absurd, the one bag we checked in was 12 pounds overweight and that cost an extra $198 which is more than the initial price for the bag. On most other airlines I've been on baggage is around 1 to 3 hundred, depending on how many bags I'm carrying and checking in. All these issues held up the line more than it already was and i felt the tension from the people behind us and i felt bad for them cause it felt as if they may miss their flights due to how close its cutting. I got charged the money then was told to simply call customer service which I'm hoping are better than what I've experienced in person. So much for “ultra low cost” this is a scam. The seats were hard but i can handle uncomfortable flights. I kept calm and didn't make a problem out of it cause i didn't wanna stir the pot but damn.",-1

They overbooked the flight and sold my seat out from under me. I paid a lot extra for it, was an aisle seat with extra leg room. When I got to the check-in they reassigned me a seat, the woman at the check-in assured me that it had extra leg room, but it didn't - it was in the middle and a small cramped seat. I'm a 6 ft 2-in man my knees were against the front seat the whole time I was so cramped it was unbelievable.

2022-12-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,prioritizing a member of their staff,False,"  I reserved (and paid for) an isle emergency exit seat. I even got the boarding pass for that seat printed on the airport. When I came to the gate I was told that ""they""  changed my seat and as my seat is already taken I am now sitting in a normal row. I am 1,95 tall and i paid for that seat with more legroom? Okay, so after more complaining I was assigned another emergency exit seat again (but a middle one). Well, not great (not sure if i would have still paid for that one), but nothing more to do about it now. When I got on the plane i saw that on my original seat a non-flying spirit employee was sitting. Coincidence? So ""they"" were just prioritizing a member of their staff over a reserved and paid and assigned seat. Wow. But i am not finished: the guy sitting on the window seat next to my new little seat was taking up 50% of my seat as well due to his XL size. Side note: why do they let people board a plane without requiring to buy 2 seats if they can clearly not stay in their seat area? So instead of a full isle seat i know got half a middle seat. Impossible to sit there (i do fit in one seat but i am a tall guy myself). So i asked if I can change to the middle seat next to my original seat instead. Was told that i need to wait till boarding i completed. Okay, boarding completed. Still vacant. But now the spirit guy on my seat tried to stop me from moving telling me that I cannot change my seat due to regulations and besides it would be again a middle seat, so I ""don't win"" anything. I explained him that I would as I would get a full seat instead of half a seat, but he still tried to keep his empty neighbor-seat and telling me that he doesn't want me to move. And only after a working flight attendant (that I asked again) allowed me to move he was visibly pissed with me now sitting there. What an attitude and what a customer service, especially considering that he magically got my already assigned seat somehow before that. Great job spirit, great job.",-1

Rushed it to checkpoint, but missed flight by 5 minutes. While I don't understand why my ID did not work (never explained to me), Spirit Airlines customer service at the ticketing and gate was awful. I was told numerous times by LA ticket agent that she did not care about my family missing flight. I have flown many airlines but will never fly Spirit again after this experience. I called customer service next day after spending night on my dime and rebooking with different airlines. They promised me refund for me and family for missed flight and bagged. Called back two weeks later for status and customer service said refund was canceled? You pay what you get for, so if you want cheap flight, terrible customer service and very good possibility of delayed or missed flights, book Spirit. If not, look elsewhere as I sure will",-1
2022-12-01,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Dallas to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the staff are extremely rude and disrespectful,False,  Spirit Airlines flight 718 to LGA from DFW are know for their cheap fare. I took a red eye Thursday morning for work and there’s no better way to say the staff (from the gate agent to the stewardess) are extremely rude and disrespectful. I watched one by one as they were rude to 90% of the guests boarding their flight. Not 1 “Hello” not 1 “Good Morning” even watched as they told a lady traveling solo with 2 small children to hurry and take a seat. From the time I arrived at the gate these “workers” energy had me immediately cancel my return flight as I will not put up with rudeness of this kind. Especially when myself and many others “pay your salary”!,-1
2022-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,their staff are very rude and unprofessional,True, Spirit is a scam! They are always overbooked so they do everything to keep you out of your flight. They play with your time to pass 45 min to your departure time and then won't let you get in the plane unless you pay them almost $200! To just change the flight and wait for hours or days. They charge you for everything that you consider light weight and normal personal item for almost $200. The plane is a piece of junk and their staff are very rude and unprofessional. Shame on you and US governments that let such a big fraud work here freely.,-1
2022-12-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,scam you out of hundreds of dollars for a bag,True,"  I cannot stress enough what a complete rip off this airline is. This was our first time traveling alone (without our parents) and had 2 carry in’s each ( duffle bags) Spirit made an announcement that if you had any bags, they needed to be tagged. We took, what we considered “carry on” as they were small and light, but was charged $198. We were appalled but had no choice if we wanted to make our return flight. My mom has now been waiting over 1 hour and 45 min to speak with anyone. It’s all SMS so she probably won’t ever get our money back. So disappointing that airlines offer great flight rates to travel but then scam you out of hundreds of dollars for a bag that fits under the seat. Not to mention the attendants were rude as well. Save yourself the financial surprises and choose another company. Oh, and a Sprite will run you $4.",-1
2022-11-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Miami,,,,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience with Spirit,True,"  My first and worst experience with Spirit. They customer service is awful, they don't care about your money and time. We were at the boarding pass gate 45 min before flight and they had us to go to the self check in baggage instead helping us with passing board and took us 5min,then went to the boarding pass and they said now we can't do anything and you missed the flight because it passed 45 min! They didn't let us to enter to the flight even without bags.  The only thing that the supervisor knew to say was No. Not helpful at all. They had us to change the flight for a day later with a connection and also paying extra money. With a new born baby we have to find a place to stay and cause us a lot of money and time.",-1

Go to the airport my bag was over 40lbs so the lady told me to pay $70 or take some items out and put in a grocery bag which I did I then get to my gate they and then charged me $100 for the grocery bag, my carry on was my purse a small purse that go over my shoulder - the lady should’ve told me that they were going to charge me $100 for it. For all of that I could’ve just paid the $70 because it was over by 8lbs. Then I get on my flight we are boarding and I put the grocery bag in the cubby it was a single one by itself and the flight attendant says we need to take it out because they need more space and I’m like no I just paid $100 for this bag to get on the flight I just feel like I should be credited back $100.",-1
2022-11-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,awful experience,True, I would avoid this airline at all costs. First my flight was delayed resulting in me missing my connecting flight. Second I was charged $99 for my carry on bag. My carry on bag cost more than my flight. When I tried checking my carry in online it was no where to be found forcing me to pay extra when I got to my gate. The airplane has absolutely no leg room. I am 5’8 and my knees were pressed against the seat in front of me. It was also freezing in the airplane being blasted with cold air the entire flight while is 40 degrees outside. Overall awful experience and will make sure to be avoiding this airline in the future.,-1

And yet, the gate was changed last minute, the boarding was late and worse a $99 charge was added to my account because of a small bag! Small! Worse, 2 minors were refused entry because their bag was too big and they couldn't pay with cash. They were left crying at the gate. I tried to help pay but they said they were closing the gate. They shut down the front desk before all people were processed. Never ever again. This company wont exist in 2 years. Mark my words",-1

I paid for a trip that I needed to cancel and rebook. I supplied all the information they requested, had numerous chats and was not responded to. They kept my $450+ seats and bag check that I paid for. I have never had an airline be so unresponsive. It will always be a win for them and a lose for the customer!",-1
2022-11-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Miami,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst airline I've flown,True,"  This airline is nothing but a huge rip-offer. They charge ridiculous amount for every single additional service. The biggest rip-off but perhaps their biggest source of income is baggage charge. And please be careful because even if you have paid for additional baggage online in advance, at the check-in counter, they can just pretend it doesn't show on their system and refuse to let you board without paying for the same baggage one more time, but with a bigger amount. They will just keep saying they have no idea. Even when you show them confirmation emails as proof, they will just keep saying it doesn't show on their stupid system. They'll even blame you for possibly being scammed by other websites even though you have paid through websites that officially represent their airlines and they say they know those websites very well. The attitude of their staff is also beyond words. They treat you as if you beg them for a free seat on the plane. Some of them even laugh at you for being charged extra at the counter. There are so so so many hidden costs from the moment you book until you board. In short, this is the worst airline I've flown. It's the worst even among all the low-cost airlines I have travelled with.",-1

Would never recommend Spirit, not to anyone for any reason! Terrible customer service! Uncomfortable seats! Reserved front row then told to move to second row after paying for front row because they have airbag on seatbelts on front row. Ridiculous! No mention of that when paying. Awful, never again will fly this supposedly cheap airline! Do yourself a favor and book with anyone other than Spirit.",-1
2022-11-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Florida,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no other airlines are treating people that poorly,True," Flying Spirit Airlines is the most horrible experience ever. Yes, it is cheap, but if you add $60 for luggage and all the trouble you have to go through it is not worth it whatsoever. I fly a lot and no other airlines are treating people that poorly. They change the time of your flight and don't care if it is convenient for you or not. They are constantly late. Employees are highly unprofessional and rude. Seats are so uncomfortable that it feels like you were sitting for couple hours on wooden bench. They will not let you board the plane if you are less than 45 min early. They charge arm and a leg for 1lb over limit on your luggage. Customer service sucks! People should stop using this airline only to show that doing business this way is unacceptable! I know I am.",-1
2022-11-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1.0,I would not recommend this airline,False,"  We booked with Sprit Airlines to fly to Orlando for the day and fly back had our tickets ready and got to the airport one hour before the ""take off time"" for a small airport that is about the right time to get there. After going through TSA Myself and 10 other people were not allowed to board the plane due to them ""already closing the door"" The plane sat in the loading area for 10 minutes before taxiing out to the runway. All those people could have boarded the plan without doing anything besides opening a door but the crew at the front said that their airline has been running late to much and they had to start taking off sooner then the times they gave us. After it was all said and done the man came out to myself and the 10 other people to state that none of us were getting our money back. So we are out 600$ and was lucky to find another way to where we were going. After calling their customer Service center the women was very rude and kept saying no, no, no almost like a child. It was very weird and I would not recommend this airline at all even for the price. I do not like leaving reviews however something has got to change with this airline.",-1

As long as your carry on fits the measuring drop, you will not be charged for it. Just stuff your purse in the bigger bag, and you save lots of money. The flight attendants were very nice when I told them I was a nervous flyer with a phobia of flying. On the way to Las Vegas when I was boarding the pilot said hello and was reassuring when he heard I was scared and was forcing myself to take an airline. They were on time to Nevada and back to Detroit, so no problems there. I took another budget airline once before, but Spirit was better. My only complaint is the wifi is bad, and the seats are small and your behind will start to hurt after a few hours. Once they fix the seat issue and make them more comfortable, and get the wi fi working better, I wouldn't have a single complaint. I wouldn't recommend for a long flight, but for a nonstop for 4 hours it's good enough.",1

The cheap ticket cost is a sham because when you check in they charge you a fortune for all bags accept a back pack/briefcase(1/person). We were charged $289.00 for 3 bags. Also if any of the checked bags are over 40lbs they charge for that as well. Received a notification 2hrs prior to flight that we would have a 3hr delay and would not make any accommodations for the delay. Do not fly with this airline!,-1
2022-11-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Sacramento,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,will never again fly Spirit,False," This is the worst airline you could ever fly on. There was no friendly people greeting you anywhere on or off the air plane. They're all doing their own thing. The only time that they wanted to interact with you or were concerned with you is to make sure you were paying extra for anything that you needed to pay extra for. Absolutely the most uncomfortable seats you could ever possibly sit in. For a 4-Hour flight we were never offered anything to eat or drink. They did however say that you could pay for things like food or drink and water. However no ever came to even offer not even to buy they food items. The only thing they came by to do was to see if you wanted to sign up for their credit card. Everything was an extra cost your baggage, food, anything you could want was all nickel and dimed. Also this was not a cheap flight it was the most expensive way I've ever taken and that was before all the extra charges and fees. Their baggage fees are also higher than anyone else's. My trip is not over I still have to fly home and I am dreading the flight home on Spirit Airlines all I want to do is cancel my flight and get on a different one but I know that they will heavily penalize me and charge me even more money. I will never again fly Spirit and after talking to many other people they have all said the same thing.",-1
2022-11-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Baltimore,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will never fly them again!,False,"  My first time flying Spirit and my last time forever, I have never seen such a chaotic and unorganized airline, it all started with checking bags no signs for anything 3 different lines and all for different things and no signage for any of it. Let alone I have never heard of your check bags having to be under 40 pounds every other airline I have flown is under 50. Paying $385 for 3 checked bags is highway robbery and a huge joke. The flight attendants on the flight were super nice and helpful when needed. The seats feel like wooden chairs with barley and padding and the wifi couldn’t even load up google. So overall I would never recommend flying them they make it seem like it’s a cheap air line which it is if you just have a back pack but if you check a bag or have a carry on you might as well pay the extra money for a nicer airline ticket it cost the same as checking bags at spirit, but I will never fly them again!",-1

When I get to the plane the seats are the worst seats I’ve ever sat in on a plane. Extremely uncomfortable with a child on you. There is now wi-fi on board no nothing. Then I make it to Orlando and the flight is also delayed. I was supposed to take off at 6:18 but took off almost 10:30pm. By the time I got to Puerto Rico I have lost my hotel reservation and had to pay walk-in price. Reservation price is $144 and walk-in is $292. Not to say I lost an entire day of my vacation in the airports because of this airline. I would rather pay an extra $400 and fly American Airlines which the seats recline, they have free entertainment, free snacks and drinks free carry-on and the staff is great. Spirit should be just that a spirit in this business. To the ceo of this company loosen the purse strings a little and make it worth flying your airline",-1

Our flight was for November 17th 2:15 pm. We received an email stating that it would be delayed 2 hours at 12:15 pm. As we were ordering our uber to the airport. We then decided to stay in Vegas and walk down the strip to kill off some time. By 2 pm we decide to get our baggage from our hotel and go to the airport to make our new flight that was for 4:38 pm. By 2:50 pm we get to the airport. At this time we cannot self check-in so we need to wait in line to see a clerk. As we approached the line we received another email from spirit airline saying our flight would now be for 3:15 pm! Many other people in that lineup had received the same email. Chaos broke. We think, this must be a mistake. Our flight is departing as we were checking in. Once we got to the clerk, she was just as confused. She did not offer us another flight when we explained what happened. She told us ""emails don't mean a thing"". What kind of excuse is that? She told us she couldn't refund us. We had to call the airline and make sure we got our refund. I'm still praying I get it. By far our worst experience ever. So disorganized, incoherent, absolutely unprofessional.

Our flight was delayed 30 min. Upon arrival at OIA, we sat on the tarmac in the plane for 30 min, waiting for them to prepare a gate for us. The Captain kept apologizing, saying be called several times to request a gate and was told there were several planes. It appeared that there was only a small crew working. At the baggage claim, everyone on our flight waited over an hour before we got our luggage. There were 5 planes landing within a 30 min. time period, all Spirit. Another airline's travelers collected their bags right away and left. We waited over an hour. The 2 women in the baggage claim office could not help us. There was no one to call to get a resolution. Our plane landed at 12 am. We finally were able to leave at 2 am. I paid over $1,000 for my ticket to St. Martin, as there were all added on fees. Snack or beverage service was by purchase only. There was nothing complementary. This whole experience was very poor service, not professional, and unacceptable.",-1

I began second guessing my choice but $44 is $44 and I just couldn't pass that up! We upgraded to the big front seats for additional $$ but we kept all our personal belongings to our free personal item bags, which was sufficient for our 4 day trip. No carry on or checked baggage. We also packed some snacks for the flight to avoid buying food onboard. We couldn't have been more happy with the entire trip. Will fly Spirit again and highly recommend!.

I was pretty tap out of money when leaving. As we left San Diego we stop at las Vegas as our connecting flight to catch few hrs later same day. When we got there our flight was delayed until night time .. as we waited until the following morning the next day. Spirit Airlines said they cancel our flight due to weather which was odd because weather was fine in both state location. Spiriit Airlines said they have rebook our ticklers for departure three days out. I was so stress to figure out how to feed my kids and shelter them during the wait time as I had no money. My children one teenager one infant and two toddlers and one of my toddlers has medical condition with epilepsy. As we slept over night in airport first night I had to stay awake to make sure my kids were safe. I had no money for food tat the end of the following day. spirit airlines did not care what my concerns where as for as my kids. They could and didn’t care to help me in this situation that they spirit airlines had put me in my family. After talking with Spirit Airlines Associates as I walk away I heard them talking about pilot not showing up for flight that brought this nightmare experience. spirit Airlines lied to me about reason on flight cancellations to they weren’t liable but the very important of my more complaint is Spirit airlines didn’t not care to help with any type of vouchers to help. They refuse to help and turn it into a horrible nightmare that I had to deal with for 4 days.",-1

After many hours of waiting on the WhatsApp chat (over multiple days) and going in circles, the customer service at Spirit Airlines have failed me.

When I left Fort Lauderdale to Newark I went with my personal belongings for 3 days trip. They did not inform that it will be extra charge for the bag But when I trace back from Newark to Fort Lauderdale I came back with the same and they told me that I have to pay extra 99$ for this bag. I asked how come you guys did not tell me in my 1st flight their answer was that someone from their company didn’t do their job What we putting our life’s their hands to fly and how many are not doing their job right. Also I came a shout ahead of my flight but it took 30 minutes to talk to an agent then the agent told me that I miss flight although the flight on the screen was showing 29 minutes delayed They charged me extra 70$ to book to next flight They made their money the 1st time and they didn’t care if I am coming back.

2022-11-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to las Vegas,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,price was amazing for a direct flight,True,"  The ticket price was amazing for a direct flight. Due to that I was able to fly with my husband during his business trip. Before purchasing we checked Spirit review ratings and was leery of the, under 2.5, star rating. I decided to also check the reviews of a more pricy airline and they were no better. The poor reviews for Spirit mostly revolves around the addition of fees for upgraded services that other airlines consider standard and will not charge for. For instance, the charges for a carry-on bag. As Spirit allows a personal item (yes it’s super teeny tiny) without adding a fee, I knew I could comply with their regulations AND not have to upgrade anything. Additionally, if you are not super tech savvy, you may wish to upgrade to use a staff person at their kiosk (this is an added fee too). As long as you print you pass at home or take a screen shot of it, you will be good to go! The staff were smiling, humorous and fun! As I read one review of a sort of grimy staff person that added tons of fees to a passenger due to large bags being traveled with, I was initially worried this could happen to me. As my personal item followed their rules, all was well. Basically, know that they will charge you extra for carry on bag(s) and that during check-in the site makes you jump through tons of extra screens to complete check-in. All in all, I was exceedingly pleased with the whole process and my 2hour flight (it was the pilots first day! Thanks Nate!).

After an hour of that, we got to our gate and they announced that they were going to start boarding, so after standing for 30 minutes they then announced that they were delaying our flight for 2 1/2 hours. I can tell you that in all of the years that I’ve ever flown, Spirit is the only one I ever have had problems with. Will absolutely never fly Spirit again, I don’t care if the tickets are free.",-1

From charging you for every single bag including carry one for an international flight. In addition, they charge you for any additional weight over 39 lbs while all the other airlines allow 50 Lbs. They literally told me I was over by grams and wanted to charge me an arm and a leg. Second my connection flight in Florida was missed because of there delay, I had to sleep in the airport and blamed immigration for missing my flight. They didn’t offer me a hotel stay or other options. Overall, I spent in addition $700 in fees, missed work the following day and had to sleep in the airport. I will never fly with this airline again, first and last time. That is a promise !",-1

Missed my cruise. They gave me a vouchers to use for next flight which had to be used within 60 days. Most people don’t fly that often.

I am a frequent flyer and I have flown 5-8 times this year alone. My carry on bag has been fine every single time. Then an employee on November 2 states that it does not comply and then has the nerve to laugh in my face. It is unacceptable for a company has big and as recognized as this to have such a poor customer service representative being in the front line, being the face of your company.",-1
2022-11-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly that airline again,True,"  I know what Spirit is and I've flown them before only to get the best deal. Cheaper flights, and you pay ridiculous amounts if you want to check bags and do anything else. We tend to fly quick flights where we can just take a backpack and not deal with any of the other charges. I made a mistake booking a flight. I booked my flight to LAX fine, but the return I booked one leaving at 11:59 arriving at 5:00. Problem is I didn't notice it was 1159pm to 5am. My mistake. When I finally noticed this a week before my flight, I called and they wanted to charge more to change the flight than I paid for the entire round trip. They wanted to charge more than if I just bought another 1 way flight for earlier in the day. I am in the service industry, and I know that this is a pain for them to switch flights for people. I should be charged something. But when the other flight I'm trying to switch to is actually cheaper at that point in time of trying to change the flight..how about just charging me $25 a ticket or something? Why rake me over the coals and guarantee that I hate you now? Why tick me off and ensure I will never fly that airline again? Maybe other airlines would do the same thing, but Spirit for sure did it to me and I won't forget it.",-1

Friendly staff and quick flight, on time. On the way back we missed our flight and it was mostly our fault. Spirit rebooked our flights for free. We decided to take a Lyft down to Miami for a morning flight instead of waiting for the same flight the next night but the customer service agent was very helpful and we were very happy we didn’t have to pay to rebook. No complaints",1

It is the worst experience I have had in my entire life in terms of the value of the ticket, luggage and treatment of the airline staff. I will never fly with this airline again in my life. I went directly to the main offices of the airline, asking if the backpack I had was the right one to not have to pay for luggage and one of the people who attended me told me yes and that they were not going to charge me for the luggage. When I arrived at the airport, I had to pay $85 for a backpack that was supposedly authorized not to be checked as baggage.",-1

We are scheduled in Feb 2023. I made a mistake paying for carry-on bags that were included with ticket. Within 30 minutes I contacted Spirit to cancel the carry-on charge. The total charge for checked bags and carry-on was $206 (!) Spirit said no refunds, just travel credit. I said just want to cancel a mistake that has not posted yet. They were unwilling and kept repeating their “no refunds” policy. Customer service was insensitive, poor, not listening, and I waited in chat queue for over 90 minutes. Terrible.",-1
2022-11-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,so disappointed and upset,True,"  I asked for one of the agents to notify my partner that boarded the plane zone 1 and I was last to board zone 4 and there was a discrepancy with the carryon. The agent refused to notify my partner who had all of our credentials with the exception of my boarding pass. I was told to step aside and that I could not board the flight even while presenting all three receipts from the initial flight that covered all of our carryon bags. This carry on bag issue happened after a 2 hour layover from Los Cabos and just wanted to get home. After I didn’t board for a long period of time my fiancé came off the plane to ask what can we do to get things resolved and he was told that we were both being put off the flight and put on a no fly list and once our bags get to BWI that they would have them sent back to LAX. The supervisor was nasty towards us. The police came and also didn’t understand why they were being so extreme and told us that they have a lot of problems from Spirit Airline. The female agents have horrible attitudes and poor customer service skills. We were inconvenienced $800.00 that same day to flight United simply to get home to our eleven year old son after a seven day vacation. Spirit has basically lost two hardworking customers due to the agents at Spirit flight NK128 to board at 4:07 pm. I will never flight Spirit Airlines again and telling everyone of my family, coworkers, and friends who all travel not to use this airline. I am so disappointed and upset.",-1

We were supposed to fly back to Dallas at 1:00 am on 10/2/2022. We decided to check to see if they flight was still on schedule at about noon on 10/1/2022. That is how we found out our flight had been delayed 19 hours, and was not scheduled to leave until 8:00 pm on 10/2/2022. We never received a notification that the flight had been delayed. We had to be back for work on 10/3/2022. We called ""customer service"", and spent an hour on the phone with no resolution. We went to the airport to see if we could get resolution there. They were absolutely no help. First we were told there were no other flights. Then they told us that they could send us to LAX and the we would have a connecting flight to Dallas. After discussing this for a couple of minutes we found out the lady at the counter was planning on stranding us at LAX for a full day, and that flight wouldn't be leaving until 7:30 pm on 10/2/2022 and landing in Dallas at 11:30 am 10/3/2022. We had told her we needed to be home early on 10/2/2022. I'm still not sure how 10/3/2022 is before 10/2/2022. We then asked for a refund so we could find another airline. The lady at the desk said we would receive a refund. Her supervisor said we would receive a refund. We still have not received the refund. The first email we received from them 3 weeks after the incident said we were only entitled to a credit since we had confirmed the change. We explained once again that we did not confirm it. Then they sent us an email stating that we were only entitled to a credit since we didn't show up for the flight. These people will do anything to charge you extra for every little thing, and then refuse to refund anything even after two of their employees said they would. You cannot believe a thing they say. They have lied to us every step of the way. I would rather walk to my destination than ever fly Spirit again.",-1
2022-10-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Kansas City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,cheap flights are never worth it,True,"  Literally just spend the extra money and fly Allegiant or United or any other airline. I woke up at 3am to fly home. They served me one single shot and then proceeded to kick me off of the next flight after the layover because of the fact that I’m trying to sleep before the plane took off. Accusing me of being on pills and then realizing they messed up and giving me and my friend free tickets on the next flight which was 7 hours later. Worst airline ever,  my ears were popping so bad that I pressed the flight attendant button from being in physical pain and asked if I could get a water when I had cash but my debit card was elsewhere, and they refused to let me have any. Again so so so bad. The cheap flights are never worth it. Spend more money so you never have to experience the circumstances I went through today.",-1

They had me consolidate my plastic bag with two small 8inch boxes into my packed backpack along with 6 or 7 other passengers prior to boarding because ""only one carryon"". They even considered purses to be their own items. I asked them if they got paid more and they did not. They just choose to harass to give themselves enjoyment for their poor jobs.",-1

I had 5 tickets i paid for, 2 people decide not to fly, so I told that to a flight attendant and that we will be using those seats for my kid to sleep in it, since I paid for them, And I was told that its not going to happen since they have extra people waiting to be seated. To which I replied that I it is not happening. They took us off the flight with a 6 y old and canceled our tickets. The worst experience I have ever had in my life flying. Trust me, and don't waste your money, they will rip you off one way or another and you will end up paying a price of business class and flying in a horrible plane.",-1

Our flight was due to depart at 3:00. It was postponed, time after time, until it was canceled in the end, and the passengers were shuffled to the 20:30 flight. No explanation, no apology through out. We were stuck at the airport for 5.5 extra hours, kept in stressful suspense most of the time. P.S. On the window display for arrival schedule (during our anxious waiting time): out of the 13 flights on the list, 5 were from Spirit Airlines, of which 3 were late - and they were the only late flights on the list!

The answer is simple, Spirit Airlines is a joke and has zero feel for customer service. Explain to me how you can ask a customer to exchange contents from one bag to another and then chastise them for wanting to retrieve their phone and personal items before reboarding the plane they are supposed to be on. Our 20 year old son was on the plane and no traveling with her bags and id by himself while she is stuck in South Carolina? Spirit Airlines, you are a joke in all areas of customer service! My wife is in tears and has no clue what tomorrow is going to bring and it is 100% your fault. Be better Spirit and make this absolute gong show of a trip right.

(There were no signs stating so). I then stood in line for another 20 minutes at the right check in counter, and the agent informed me that I had to check in my bag because it was too big to carry on. Mind you, I had measured it beforehand by their length and weight requirements and I was in the clear. So I was stuck paying $79 for one checked bag. I don’t usually like aisle seats but I was placed in one, in the front row. I had a lot more legroom. Only downfall is that there were people waiting in line for the bathroom in the aisle, so I felt as though I had people standing over my shoulder at all times. There was an unruly passenger in the back who caused multiple scenes on the ground as the plane was taxiing. The flight attendant did an amazing job at handling the situation. She was very patient and sweet the whole flight. There was a certain flight attendant who had a bad attitude, but I never interacted with him so I can’t say that directly affected me.",1

Please understand that we didn't ask to change the type of room, it was made mandatory. JetBlue was the airline carrier from USA to DR and Spirit Airlines was return flight back from DR to USA. Our Spirt airline travel cost my family $872.46 which Spirit would not refund. We were told they could only give us credit to fly on Spirit at a different time. The amount of credit we were given was $484.50 Needless to say we won't be using this credit as we will never use Spirit Airlines. Worst customer service I've ever experienced.

I was flying from Las Vegas to Philadelphia with a backpack as my only piece of luggage. Before my departure, I received an e-mail reminding me to pay for my luggage. The company had noticed that I hadn't paid for any. I was confused by the e-mail because I thought that the first one was free, but didn't see anything that said it was. So, I paid for my backpack, and after arriving at the airport, I found out that the first one was free. I had contacted customer service using an online form, and was contacted 3 weeks later. They told me all about the acceptable bag sizes, and how carry-on is an optional service for me, and that I should've understood that the charges were non-refundable. I pleaded with them again, only to be reminded that if they give me a refund for their deceptive business practices then they'd have to do that for everyone. So, I want to let everyone know what happened to me so that you all will learn to fly with anyone else if you plan on abusing the airline's policy of carrying on items to bring with you to your travel destination.",-1

The worst part was their miserable employee in Baltimore. Staff was extremely rude to myself and other passengers when we were trying to board. She tried to charge me $99 for a carry on & I almost missed my flight because of it. $99 for a carry on! The lady who tried to charge my card couldn't get it to work so she graciously let me board. The extremely rude employee still gave me a hard time about boarding and said they were doing me a ""favor"" by ""letting"" me board. Never again.",-1
2022-10-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,do not recommend this airline,False,"  Never purchase tickets from this airline! I recently went to Vegas for a vacation. I booked this flight back in April of this year. First issue I had was they sent me a modified flight cause they over booked! Again I purchased in April this email was a month or two later so my flight should have been set in stone. Second I went to verify my flight on the app for easier boarding. I went and completed all the steps including my seat assignments that I paid for. The app said I didn’t need to do anything cause I had already had seat assignments so I continued the process. I got to the airport to find that I had no seats assigned to me that again I had paid for. Upon verifying the flight back I paid again for seat assignments just to make sure we didn’t have the problem again. I figured I’d call and get a refund for the original purchase I had made. I call to request the refund on the original seats purchased and I get a sorry you aren’t eligible for a refund! I’m heated at this point, why am I not getting a refund for the seats I paid for now three times? The supervisor I spoke with on the phone kept interrupting me and kept telling me what I had paid for which I already knew. He hung up on me twice after me asking several times for his supervisor. So let’s brake it down I paid in April two sets seat assignments on flight out and flight returned. I paid additional seats on flight out just in case I should be getting my money back for the two other purchases I had made but this airline refused. I do not recommend this airline what so ever.",-1
2022-10-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,,,,,,2.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,"  I should have remembered my previous (not so nice) experience with Spirit Airlines, but I gave them another chance. Wrong thing to do! I was supposed to fly out of O'Hare yesterday (10/18/22) to Tampa. The plane coming in was delayed because of an airport issue with another airlines, and Spirit delayed my flight from 230p to 6p to 10p and then cancelled it. Then they rescheduled for 1030a the next day. Since my car was parked close and I live an hour away, I cancelled my trip to Florida. It was a vacation - a much-needed vacation. So, thanks Spirit! They did give me a full refund and then sent a $50 voucher which I will NOT be using because I will never fly this airline again. Read the reviews. They are all true! Travel has changed forever, but Spirit is definitely not worth your time or money because you will most likely be very disappointed.",-1

How do you go about being the worst airline and add icing on the cake by charging people $100 for carry ons. It’s not like your airline is the cheapest where the cost of the carry on offsets the ticket. I spent $400 for a flight from NY to Michigan. It’s absolutely absurd. I despise this airline.  Spirit has to do better.,-1

2022-10-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Charlotte,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,True, My original flight was for 8:30pm was delayed until 9:30pm after waiting in the long line for security I get through and receive and email that the gate has changed. I had to leave security walk to the other side of the airport wait in a long security line again get through and receive another email that the gate is charged again. So I walk to the other side of the airport go thru security only to get a 3rd email saying gate has changed again. When I get to the A side of the airport the security line was to long to wait because I would have missed my flight so I had to pay $190 extra to pass all security to make my flight when I called to complain I'm told it's not their problem. That they do this all the time. So now I'm being told they do this all the time. As a business you would think they would find a solution to avoid this issue. Needless to say I will never fly Spirit again.,-1
2022-10-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Phoenix,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,2.0,charged $99 for a carry-on,True,"  When I read the negative reviews about Spirit Airlines, especially related to the nickel & diming, my first thought is that at least the reviewers were aware of the gouging & charging for carry-ons. Not so for at least 2 dozen passengers on my flight who, along with me, were in shock to be moved to a separate boarding line to be charged $99 for a carry-on, delaying the flight and creating vows of, “I will never fly Spirit again.” I asked the attendant if the Spirit App had somehow made it clear to me that I would be charged (most other airlines don’t), would it have been cheaper if I had paid at time of check-in. She said, “Yes”. I believe $40. So why didn’t someone inform me, perhaps the check-in staff or the App? I was fortunate to sit next to a Spirit employee on the flight, and told him of this deception. He was not aware. He checked the App and informed me that the App does mention the carry-on charges in small print, IF you are looking for it. Obviously Spirit Airlines has done this deliberately. $40 vs $99? Do the math = $59 extra x’s 20 people or more per flight. People will even reluctantly, pay for extra fees IF the service is good and a company is upfront & transparent. Spirit Airlines is not.",-1
2022-10-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Bogota,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,"  When departing from Bogota to MIA last October 12th. no problem was put to my wife and I´ backpacks; however, when we were about to enter checkpoint Concourse G at MIA for our today´s return flight number 3102, two ground Spirit members claimed our backpacks were oversized and forced us to pay $80 USD a piece on the grounds, and I quote, that "" we would be in trouble and would not be able to catch the flight"". We should have taken a picture to our packs as evidence, but we were so shocked that we simply slipped our card and got to the check point. No other passengers with same size packs were either stopped, or not allowed to board the flight; we consider this an unfair ripoff, for we only carried a small luggage for just a 5 day stay in Miami, and we were never ever stopped, or requested to pay for our baggage in Bogota by the members of your airline. We will never fly this airline again.",-1
2022-10-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Portland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Most awful airline to deal with,False,  Most awful airline to deal with. I purchased 3 round trip tickets for myself and my family. Paying for bags and choosing of seats. When I went to depart they said I did not pay for my bag tickets so I had to pay again. I just was talking to them to try and get refunded and they say I did not purchase when I have an email showing I did. Never will I ever fly with them again. They are liars.

2022-10-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,This is such a ripoff,False," This was my first and (last time) that I have flown with Spirit, I have flown multiple times with other airlines with my backpack carry-on bag with no issues. When I was boarding my flight with Spirit I was stopped and told I needed to put my bag in the box they use to measure the bags and was told my bag was too big and that I had to pay $99 to take it on. This is such a ripoff and in my opinion a way for them to bleed money from people. Also all drinks on the flight require purchase, even water at a fee of $3.50. I will never again book a flight with this carrier. They offer cheap flights and then rip people off after they do. Consider any other option when searching for a flight rather than this carrier.",-1
2022-10-16,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Charlotte to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"not nice, they are not helpful",False," Cheap. That’s it. Spirit Airlines are not nice, they are not helpful, they are disorganized, they will rip you off and take advantage of you with any chance they get. It is unbelievable to me that our country allows this company to be in charge of peoples lives. A successful flight with Spirit is a strike of luck. I am a travel nurse and will never again trust these people with my well-being.",-1

It was a perfect weather and other airlines were flying. I had to rebook another flight with an additional $60. I complained about it and was given a voucher of $50 to be used before it expires (Nov, 28th 2022). I tried using the voucher for a flight on Nov 5th, 2022, it did not let me use it with some error I did not understand. I reached to customer service and they then gave me this unbelievable reason stating that ""the voucher has a clause to be used in October only and is not valid for November"". The voucher email has no such clause and clearly mentions to be used on any Spirit flight before expiry date. Had a nightmare and horrible experience travelling with them. I would never ever recommend Spirit to anyone ever in life.",-1

2022-10-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Nashville,,,,,,,1.0,never book with Spirit,True,"  
By far the worst customer service. Booked my flight back in June ($850), received an email stating my payment didn’t go through, but didn’t see it until now (Oct). Called to check/rebook, and the cost was ($1500). Before I processed the new payment, I checked spirit’s online cost and it was $1141? So I stupidly booked online before checking my bank acct. Checked my bank acct after booking and saw the charge had gone through in June. I asked to speak to a manager to ask about the email, and why they were going to charge me $400 over the online price, and he wasn’t giving me a direct answer. I got frustrated after going in circles for 20 mins so I told him “you’re not giving me a direct answer, so let’s just drop this and I’d like a refund for my flight booked today”. I heard a click and he was gone. I don’t think it was a coincidence. Pretty sure he hung up on me. Called again for a manager and this time they said they can’t transfer me because they “don’t do that”, they “have to take a note and give it to the manager to take under consideration.” I explained I was easily transferred 20 mins ago and they still said “no, we don’t do that here.” So I give up on trying for a manager again and asked for a refund and they refused because it is 6 days until my flight. Apparently, they have a 7 day cancellation policy. I asked them to be reasonable as this was just booked 30 mins ago and I don’t have that kind of $ to throw away and they still said no. I requested a manager and they refused to transfer me. 2 lessons learned: check my bank account first and cover all my bases, and never book with Spirit.  Poor customer service.",-1

After 12 hour delay in getting to our final destination due to needing to refuel the plane and therefore missing our connection, they refused to reimburse us or even give food vouchers for while we were stuck in the airport waiting for the next available flight.

After reading multiple reviews on them I now see that we aren’t the only ones who were treated poorly. I had booked the flight for my minor son so he could be with the rest of us on vacation. Not only did Spirit tell him they couldn’t put him on the flight because they over sold the flight, they also told him that his luggage would be transported to his destination and they would not give it back. They told him he had to wait for it to be sent back. This is a joke of an airline. I would not recommend it to anyone.",-1

I was looking to change to an earlier flight on the original date of departure for 3 people. Plenty of seats available on the earlier flight. Website was not working....again, so I was using the text chat. Totally understand that there would be some sort of modification fee and I was told the total for 3 people would be $711. Here's the kicker, if I purchased 3 new tickets, the cost would be $456. Please Frontier, take over this airline and train them the right way in customer service!",-1

They have no regard to your personal plans as part of the trip. My family checked in at the airport, paid for luggage, received boarding pass, cleared security and at the gate they were told there are no seats available. And they want them to find another flight on a different date. How can you issue a boarding pass without property accounting for seats on the aircraft? What that tells that they absolutely have no accountability for their actions. On top of it there is really no government oversight on this process. We will stop flying Spirit henceforth. Yea. I get it that they are the cheapest. But cheap is not everything in life.",-1
2022-10-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Terrible customer service,True,"  I’ve flown with Spirit Airlines for years. I loved it, the fares were cheap and Spirit Flies to many places. Well, if you have an emergency, or get in a traffic jam, or whatever hardship may pass your way that inhibits you and your party from reaching the airport in the 45 minute time frame- you are out of luck with this company. Their customer service at the ticket counter is nil. I got a shoulder shrug and that was it. No help with another flight. I believe everything happens for a reason. So I walked off with no flight-no help to book a flight- and shrugged shoulders from the person at the Spirit Bag Checkin counter. Thanks Spirit. I googled on my phone and found a flight departure with another airline within 2 hours. Why another airline? Because “fool me once, shame on you”; also I didn’t want to use my luggage as a pillow and blanket at the airport. Once I was settled in and waiting for my flight, I contacted Spirit and asked what they were able to do for me and their response was because the flight already departed (early I might add), all they could do was put me on the next flight to my destination. That flight was 9 hrs later with an overnight layover. Basically, I was going to spend the night at another airport and wait until the next morning to fly to my destination. Nice. No thanks. No refund. No offer to comp it. Terrible customer service. Never again will I fly with such a horrible company.",-1

The first flight was cancelled due to Hurricane Ian (understandable). We rescheduled our Flight from Tampa to Ft Lauderdale the next day. No problems with that flight, we made it to New Orleans fine. On our trip back is where we ran into problems. At 1 am the day of travel, we were notified of the returning flight being cancelled. Our plan was to be at airport at 10am. The fact that they cancelled the flight during the middle of the night is unacceptable. Most people would not be awake at that time. There was no reason given for the cancellation and there were no other flights that day to Tampa. We of course called Spirit and decided that waiting on hold for 4 hours wouldn't solve anything. We had to rent a minivan because there were 7 of us, and drive from New Orleans to Tampa. The next day we all messaged spirit airlines on their Chat feature. We asked for a refund and the automated chat said it would be reviewed. 5 days later and still no updates. In order to make this right, Spirit should fully refund all of our returning flights and comp the rental. Spirit's customer service is awful and everyone on the trip are guaranteed to never use spirit again. No explanation for flight cancellation and impossible to talk to a real person. Pay the extra $50 for a better airline and less headache.",-1

It was a “package” that includes the plane tickets, hotel and rental car. We arrived to the airport 2 hours early as recommended. After checking bags and going through security, We arrived at our gate at 4:05 for a 5pm flight. It was supposed to begin boarding at 4:15. We were informed around 4:30 that the plane needed maintenance and would be delayed until 10:15.this was reflected on the website. With 5 hours to spare, we decided to sit for a meal immediately next to our gate. After our meal, we found a spot close by to charge our phones and keep entertained until 10. Around 7:30 I had the idea to check that our delayed flight would still be arriving at 10:15. The website said the planes status was “in flight” and had left at 5:45. We did not receive a notification email or text. We spoke with the lady working at the Spirit desk and she said our flight could be rebooked for free or refunded. We went to the ticket counter/check in area, where no one was working and then attempted to get in touch with the airline. (BTW this is close to impossible). Chat was a 45 minute wait, text didn’t work. Someone finally answered my call and I was then informed that I could NOT receive a refund or rebook because we were listed as “no shows”. This is absolutely absurd. Flight was delayed, we were not informed that it was no longer delayed so long, we missed flight. We did not no show intentionally. Our bags were checked in. I have filed a complaint on their website and will be demanding a refund.",-1

I still have not been refunded after hours calling and on the text app. I booked through a third party and was approved to be refunded directly by upper management. I was told to wait for a call back, surprise, no call. I texted the app and after many hours, a staff member responded.

Starting from the booking online to checking in at the airport and in the plane every single staff member of Spirit Airlines is rude, unfriendly, moody and grumpy. They all have the biggest attitude ever. If you ask them for help in any way possible, they look at you with such disgust and anger as if to say we are not supposed to ask them questions.

We get to the airport and still we had to pay 65 more than expected. When we called customer service to fix the problem they made it seem like we were just scamming to get our money back asking “well I don’t see another call record you sure you called this morning about the issue” or “well I don’t see any attempt to try and check your bags online” even though we have screen shots and documentation of both the call and the error page.

They employees told the family ""I work here, you don't,"" ""fly or don't and lose your tickets."" Spirit Airlines did not honor the sale of the tickets and did not give any indication that the 2 year old would need their own ticket even though they had the date of birth for the 2 year old on record. In addition they would not provide vouchers or allow any transfers of the tickets to help some of the family members get home to work. Their unwillingness to help and the complete dismissal of the employees at O'Hare Airport, as well as the manager, may have cost one of our military member's jobs effectively harming their livelihood in addition to their military service.

I wasn't worried about the first one, but they cancel the flights just hours before boarding and only notify you via email. I ended up paying 5x the cost of the ticket to get out with a different airline because they lead you on by rebooking you a flight soon afterwards, which will also be cancelled.

No compensation for ruined vacation and no care in the world from them. The manager not employees knew a thing about customer care or anything to do with an airline it absolutely blew my mind. We got told flight canceled due to crew disruption. Who was being disruptive at 6:00 am. When I tried to call the automated service didn’t work. I tried the text message I was told a 7 hour wait before i would get any response. In five hours I was disconnected from the message before I spoke with anyone! Please do not book this airline for anything!",-1

I’m gonna have to pay for another hotel room and other expenses cause I’ll have to spend a day traveling tomorrow, I’m so exhausted, tired, angry with this company, nothing ever is done to help the passengers we only get headaches flying spirit airlines.

Called their customer service line as I drove the 45 min and was on hold the entire time and no one answered. Arrived at their service counter and waited 45 min online. Their 10.19am flight to the same destination now showed as canceled. The agent said she could refund me or book me on the next flight leaving at 4.35pm. I booked it and searched for other flights. As I was searching my new flight showed canceled. They would have flown me to Chicago and left me stuck there as the second leg of my rebooked flight was canceled. Booked a flight on another airline and then waited another 50 min online to get a full refund. A complete joke and will never use this airline again.",1
2022-10-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,by far the worst experience,False, This is the by far the worst experience I have ever had with an Airline. The night prior to my flight leaving at 10:19 am I received an email saying that my flight had been canceled and the only other options provided for my flight gave me a 12 delay from getting to my destination. The customer service was horrible and there was no compensation for any inconveniences for a flight that I had booked months prior or the events that I missed. I do not and would not recommend this airline.,-1
2022-09-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Price gouging due to a hurricane,False," Orlando to Atlanta. Never ever trust what Spirit say they will do: Their website said: Spirit Airlines: Spirit Airlines has a Flexible Travel Policy in effect for certain flights likely impacted by Hurricane Ian. Flights to/from/through: Orlando International Airport (MCO Travel Dates September 27 - 30, 2023 Fare difference is waived is travel is rebooked with travel by October 3, 2022. After this date, the modification charge is waived, but a fare difference is applied. I called them today after the hurricane knocked out the power in the place we were to stay and asked to rebook and transfer to same flight (of same price) a week later - the charges they added on were more then purchasing the new ticket outright - they wanted fees plus new ticket bringing it $385 when initial paid was $190! Ridiculous! They do not tell the truth! Price gouging due to a hurricane! Disgusting",-1

I have been so inconvenienced and no employee here at at Spirit cares. My plane was late by 2.5 hours yet when I get to Vegas my plane is boarding but I am told it isn't my flight any longer. I have to be in San Diego before 7 which my original flight got me there at 1. This airline is horrible with no customer services!

2022-09-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Minnesota,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Will never fly this airline agNai,False, Paid $400 for the trip which included a layover in Las Vegas. The flight to Minnesota was cancelled moments after I landed in Vegas. The next flight to Minnesota was scheduled to leave the same day as my return trip so there was no point in me getting a different flight. I ended up going back to Atlanta and since this was the only decision I could make they refused to refund my trip. Had I not taken the flight back to Atlanta the same day I would’ve gotten one. It makes no sense I paid to go to Minnesota and never made it. I was supposed to return to Atlanta on the 3rd but wouldn’t make it to Minnesota until then which defeats the purpose of my trip. The lady I spoke with on the phone was even rude and hung up after telling me I wasted $400 for nothing. Will never fly this airline again don’t care how cheap it is it isn’t worth it when I pay for something I don’t get and my money isn’t refunded it’s robbery,-1
2022-09-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Miami,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,never recommend them,True,"  Never will fly again in this irresponsible airline. I was seated in front the first 3 rows seat 3A, and there were many staff as flyers, on the back of my seat (4A) there were a lady from Spirit staff coughing all the trip, with no mask, no covering her cough. Nobody from the staff gave her a mask or ask her to cover her mouth, very sad to try for the first time this poor airline, uncomfortable, terrible, never recommend them.",-1
2022-09-30,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Indianapolis,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Do not buy the Savers Club,False," Do not buy the Savers Club. Absolute waste. I didn't even realize I got it and when I tried to cancel, they said I would have to cancel the whole flight. You cannot get a refund at all from this. Then when I checked on the flight without the Savers Club, it was actually over $200 cheaper without it. Absolute ripoff. Ober an hour wait on the phone and the language barrier. Just painful and expensive lesson.",-1
2022-09-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Portland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,rebooked for a flight two days later,True,"  I purchased a round trip ticket from Portland OR to Las Vegas NV in May for my trip in September. My trip was supposed to be departing to from Portland OR to Las Vegas NV on September 16th and I was supposed to be flying back from Las Vegas NV to Portland OR evening of September 19th. I booked my flight in May, I read online that Spirit Airlines had ongoing reports of cancelling flight last minute and leaving their customers with terrible experiences, but I was hoping this would not be the case for me. My flight to Vegas from Portland had no issues. On Monday, September 18th at 9:00 PM, I received a notification on my phone that I was able to check in and did so. The following day on September 19th, I checked out of my hotel at 10am and walked the strip to pass the time before my flight. Between 10am and 3pm, I kept receiving notifications through email and the Spirit Airlines App that the fight was on track and if I wanted to upgrade to either baggage check in or a better ticket. I kept checking the see the status of my flight and there were no changes to depart at 8:50 pm. I took an Uber to the airport at 4:25pm and arrived at the airport at 4:46pm. Upon my arrival, I received a notification that my flight had been cancelled. A minute later, I received another email that my flight was rebooked for Wednesday, September 21st @ 5:30 am. So 4 hours before my flight, I was notified that my flight got canceled and rebooked for a flight two days later!! I called the Spirit number that was in my email and spoke to a rep who was not helpful in any way possible. After expressing my frustration of cancelling my flight and the amount of distress it put me under, I was giving only two options from the customer care rep which was to either get a credit on my account or a full refund for that flight. I asked if I would be compensated for hotel stay due to the cancellation and I was denied any compensation. Please keep in mind that I booked this trip in May and saved a certain amount for this trip so to have to spend another 2 days in Vegas with trying to find hotel stay and dining was going to be expensive regardless of where I went. My only options were to find another flight home or wait 2 days at the airport for my next flight. I met others who were in the same situation and many of them were scrambling to find the next flight. With the demand increasing, the cheapest flight was starting at $600 to fly back home. I spoke to a gentleman who was supposed to be on the same flight, and he said he checked in around 2 pm and noticed that there were plenty of seating available for the flight we were supposed to be on. I went up to a rep at the Spirit terminal and every rep was very rude and unhelpful. One even made the comment of ""your situation is not my problem"" when I was expressing my frustration on the cancellation. I inquired the reason for the cancellation and was told it was due to ""Bad Weather"" even though the other 4 flight flying to the same PDX airport were not canceled. With having to care for a pregnant wife at home and attend work, I had to purchase a ticket for the following morning and had to pay 5X the amount of what I normally paid with spirit. I will never use Spirit again and do not advise anyone to use them. Very terrible airline and customer care!!",-1
2022-09-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the customer service is terrible,False,"  Went on 2 separate trips this past month, having never flown Spirit before. The first trip, they delayed my returning flight hours before, making it impossible to make the connecting flight. They didn’t have anything else available for 2 days. The 2nd trip, also got delayed, but it was non-stop, so at least I was able to make it home at 1am. However, they landed at terminal A and we had to walk to terminal D (about 1/2 mile) to our baggage claim. There was no one directing us or explaining where to go. Most of us already went through the exit doors following baggage claim arrows and had to walk outside in the rain. The seats are paper thin and the customer service is terrible.",-1

Horrible customer service, they said is cheap, but is a scam. One bag is $79 to, coming back you have to pay $79 again, plus the trip fare, so there is nothing cheap about this airline.

That’s okay, it happens and they let us know via SMS hours before. That’s a good thing. After the boarding, the planed moved and stayed there. Minutes later, they informed us they could not fly because of the weather conditions and we’d fly minutes later. So, we stayed there for 2 hours before flying, and they did not even offer us any water. We were there, without food and drink for 2 hours and nobody did anything. After we finally flew and landed, our plane went near our exit, and they waited for at least half an hour without any air conditioning before they let us off because of some problems they didn’t tell us.",-1

I have experience it this time, back and forth. Each time was worst, no matter how early I check in or not. At returning the very back seat, even when I check in by morning and travel at night. Oh, I didn’t buy a specific seat, they didn’t assign us seat when I check in, however when I asked at the gate we had the further seats.",-1

Sure the price of the ticket might appear cheaper than other airlines but it’s a lie! Once you purchase your ticket, you also have to pay for a seat, that’s right folks, a ticket isn’t a seat...strange and a way to up the cost of passengers. Next you have to pay for a carry-on and/or to check a bag. Also note if your bag is over 40lbs you have to pay an additional fee, which you like us may not know the weight of your bag until you get to the airport. So if you pay in advance for the bag, you lose all of that particular bag money. And the new fee is $99! So they encourage you to pay in advance because it’s cheaper by $20 than waiting until to arrive at the airport but it’s in fact not cheaper, it’s a damn rip-off! They don’t give out any water or snack without charging you. Seats absolutely suck! No comfort there. Will never choose this airline again.",-1
2022-09-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Phoenix,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit was nowhere to be found,False,"  Worst experience ever. Got delayed by 2 hours, and then canceled at the time of Departure. Not a single one of the personnel could explain why. I had to rebook my own flight and had to get a hotel (it was midnight). Nothing was refunded. I repeat nothing. $600-900 of extra costs, Spirit was nowhere to be found and afterwards they simply declined every request of info or request for help. Do not fly with Spirit.",-1
2022-09-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Oakland,,,,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled the flight with an email,True,"  They cancelled the flight with an email a few hours before the flight. The option they give me was a flight 2 days later. No compensation, no penalty. Nothing. We cancelled the flight At the time the flight was cancelled, the weather was good. There was no issue. I talked to them for a while to put me in another airlines .. no avail. If an airline cancel a flight so easily, what is any guarantee on your days of a trip. Maybe if you don't have any job, and you are wondering with cheapest ticket, you don't mind coming to the airport and seeing your flight has been cancelled, maybe you want to fly with them. You should also be able to tolerate their seat spacing and discomfort. For me, I either don't travel, or respect myself enough to travel with some dignity.",-1

2022-09-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Pittsburg,,,,,,,1.0,Absolutely frustrating,True,"  I purchased tickets to attend a September wedding in Ohio in June. I subsequently had to have surgery that will not allow me to fly and I have a doctor's note saying so. I have called Spirit and they told me I have two choices, I can just cancel the ticket or send the doctor's note to them and they will decide about giving me credit towards future travel without losing their $99 cancellation fee. I have called Spirit three times and have done what they asked, get on their Chat line and take care of it from there. Yesterday I was on the Chat line for two hours and they never came on. Today I was on the Chat for three hours and every 15 minutes I would check back, and when I finally wrote, ""is anybody there?"", it said that the Chat had ended 2 hours ago. I even called Spirit again and they said the only way to resolve this was through the Chat and to try again. Well, I did, and they kicked me out after 15 minutes with me sitting in front of my computer the whole time. So, I sent Spirit an email and even though their form asked when you are traveling, I received an email back from them saying that it could take up to 30 days for them to contact me. I am flying out tomorrow. That does me absolutely no good. I even told them the last time I called them that their Chat was not working and I was put on a two minute hold and then was told that there was nothing that could be done. Absolutely frustrating!",-1
2022-09-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,Absolutely ridiculous,False,  Absolutely ridiculous! I tried to book a flight for me and my grandson. I had to modify my flight and was double charged. As I had purchased my travel insurance I thought I would receive a refund. Instead I'm given a credit for half of the amount! This cancelation is 90 days before my flight. As I waited on hold for 30 minutes the agent informs me it should have been only 24 hours before my flight for a refund and the service fees were 335.00. First of all there's plenty of time to fill my reservation from someone else and the service fees are outrageous.,-1

At this point, we demanded to be rebooked to the 2:59 flight, which also showed up late. They never canceled that first flight, denied people refunds, did not let us rebook until the new flight was confirmed to be arriving, and the desk person snapped and gave us attitude when we wanted to rebook. It is 2:45 pm now and I am still standing at the gate for this new flight, waiting for it to be cleaned. People are missing their connecting flights, kids graduating from basic training, vacations, and some even lost their hotels at their destination because they won't arrive til tomorrow at best. First and last time I will ever fly with this incompetent airline. They had the audacity to give us $7 in food credits and just $50 voucher.",-1

2022-09-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas via Los Angeles,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Terrible experience,True,"  Our flight was delayed by 1+ hour due to some ""security check on the plane"" after 1/3 of the passengers had been boarded already. They also kept the plane open waiting for some passengers who were late, extending the delay process even more. Therefore we missed our connecting flight by 30 minutes and had to come up with a solution with no compensation from Spirit. Not once did we receive an apology from any of the Spirit staff. Quite the opposite: the stewardesses in the back were loud on the flight, laughing and gossiping while most of the passengers were trying to sleep. The Wifi on the plane didn't work either. Terrible experience that messed up our vacation plans.",-1

When we arrived at our destination, I saw that my checked suitcase had been cracked and the wheel had been broken. Because they were so delayed, their customer service desk was closed. I took a picture of the damage while in the airport so they could see it was taken at baggage claim the date and time we arrived. I contacted them the next morning and they wrote back about a week later asking me to fill out a form. They responded after about another week asking me to fill out another form. I was not able to access this form and called. The representative told me that too much time had passed for this to be a valid claim but I could try filling out another form. About a three weeks a later they wrote back again telling me too much time had passed and they could not process the claim. I paid $50 in baggage fees for them to break my suitcase. Because they were late, and can't staff their office, and are so delayed with responding, I have a broken bag that can no longer be used and am not being compensated for the damage they caused. I will never fly with them again and advise others to avoid as well. Their rates seem cheaper at first bit after all the extras they squeeze in and their carelessness/complete disregard of their customers, you end up losing money in the long run.",-1

My experience was excellent. The price was cheap, the check-in process was quick and easy (kiosk at the airport), the flights were on time, the planes were not old (like on Allegiant), and overall I can say without hesitation that this was the best flight experience I've had in a long time. Great flight attendants both ways. Yes, they charge $79 for a carry-on, so don't do a carry-on! I suspect the bad reviews have more to do with the upselling than the overall value you get for the money. Don't let the fact that they charge extra for a diet coke cloud your mind. For the money, if you do it right, Spirit is a great value. I don't normally do airline reviews, but wanted to give a reality check.",1

The customer service representative told me it was an issue of name discrepancy, and he asked, “Is this how you spell your name: C H R I S T O P R?” I replied, “No, it is T O P H E R.” He told me, “That is the problem. You can cancel the flight, or I can fix it for a fee.” I immediately asked to speak to his supervisor. His supervisor confirmed that my name was spelled incorrectly on the reservation, and that it would cost $49 to fix, or I could cancel the flight. By this time I was becoming skeptical, as I have decent attention to detail, and had seen the reservation a number of times. So, I decided to look really quick as I was speaking to the supervisor, who kept telling me I needed to pay an extra $49.” And I saw it. My name was perfectly correct. No misspelling at all. I said to the supervisor, “Wait a minute! I am looking at my reservation on your app, and my name is perfect. It is spelled correctly.” And he hung up on me. Just a couple minutes passed and a third representative was on the other side of the phone, and he informed me that everything was as I wished, and my known traveller number was added and that I could do early check in now.

We had to get our bags rechecked to fly with spirit. We went through immigration, picked up our bags, and ran to Spirit on the opposite side of the airport, which took about 10-12 minutes. We arrived at the spirit counter, I paid $139 for my luggage, and printed my boarding pass at 8:53am. There wasn't a line, and I walked to the counter, and handed my boarding pass and proof my luggage to this older Spirit representative. My flight was scheduled to leave at 9:49am to Las Vegas, I was definitely within the window of being allowed to board the plane. She looked at her computer, and said I wasn't allowed to fly on the plane, because I had missed the window of checking in. She then proceeded to crumble up my boarding pass, and said I'm not going on the flight. I said I need to speak to your supervisor-this is unacceptable. She called her, and we waited 5 minutes for her supervisor to show up. I told her I am within the window of being allowed in the plane, I have the printed boarding pass stating so-they speak to each other in their native language, and the supervisor tells me that I'm not allowed on the plane. I told her that isn't fair, and she proceeds to tell me that if I didn't speak to her with so much attitude, she would help me. I told her that she would be upset as well, if she was told she wasn't allowed on the airplane when she made it on time. Eight other people missed that flight, and a couple were re-routed to Ft. Lauderdale, 30 minutes away, and were schedule to arrive the NEXT DAY to their location. Within that hour, 30 people were in line because they were seconds of missing their flights. People were visibly frustrated and upset, but Spirit workers did not care one bit. It seems as if that's how Spirit makes their money- I paid $260 for a one way flight from Miami to Sacramento and $139 for my luggage- thats $400 for a one way. They aren't cheap, and they offered credit to be used for future flights. If you'd like to use the credit, they charge you $75 to use. Do not fly with this budget airline. I will never fly with them again. We booked tickets with United, and they were far more professional and cheaper at the end of the day.",-1
2022-09-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,my first time flying with Spirit and it will be my last,True," This is my first time flying with Spirit and it will be my last. I have heard so many horror stories about this airline and let me tell you it's all true. The way the customer service representatives talk to passengers waiting for a delayed flight is absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional. Not only was the plane delayed once and flight attendants didn't have a clue as to when a plane would be here (FLL) but it was delayed a second time for 2 hours. One flight attendant lied and said flight was delayed because of weather. We knew that was a lie. Hour later we were told it's been diverted due to low fuel and will return. What sense does that make? Don't planes get refuelled upon landing? The lies and the long waiting for this plane is crazy. I have now missed my great great grandmothers (97th) birthday. Spirit Airlines attitude and continued latest should come at a cost to the airline. Why didn't I stick with the best airlines Southwest and American Airlines. Full warning don't purchase your ticket with Spirit. You'll be frustrated and won't make your trip on time. Traveling is suppose to be relaxing, timely and exciting. This situation has put such a bad taste I my mouth. I am a true believer in leaving not only bad reviews if the company deserves it, but I also participate in positive reviews so that a patron can read and understand the full dynamics of the experience. When looking for other flights in the (2-3pm) range all flights were past the time. Another note to the customer reading this review. The website also had continuous glitches and was extremely slow. I was trying to pay for my one check in bag at $69, when I got to checkout it totalled $145. You can imagine the bewildered look on my face. I had to use another computer twice to get around that mess. Don't waste your time or money. Extras: security first, purse or backpack (quantity 1) allowed for free, I couldn't believe it, any other luggage will be charged at $69 and up. You may get a slight lower rate at around $55-59 but you must add bags when you book your flight. Overall the price exceeds Major airlines such as Southwest, American, Delta. So I employ the reader reading this. Really consider if you have the time and patience to be delayed 2 or more hours. This flight meant so much to me. Really is a dagger in my heart. Thank you so much Spirit Airlines.",-1
2022-09-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit is a mess,True," This is my third time booking with Spirit. The first two trips I had to cancel and rebook with United and Amtrak due to major delays. I decided to give it one last try because I had credits. Flight got cancelled and they rebooked me for the next day. They put me on a new flight with a layover. Told me I have to pay double for a carry on (over $130) because it’s two flights. They don’t waive the fees even though they cancelled my flight! Guess what? Delayed to miss the layover. Spirit is a mess and believe me, you aren't saving any money. After fees, seats, bags its more than a flight with a good airline. Spare yourself the stress. Just look at their ratings.",-1
2022-09-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Cancun,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,stress and frustration I have experienced,False,  I hope this review will help people to avoid the stress and frustration I have experienced using this airline. I booked 2 nonstop flights in March through Spirit and both were cancelled. The flight options they offer for replacement had long layovers. Later they added more flights but told me I had to pay a cancellation fee. I understand that flight schedules change but if more flights open up later it seems unfair to not offer those new flights to customers that were forced to change their original flight. Do not fly with this airline that has no consideration for how their changes and cancellations to their customers trips!,1

My first time flying with Spirit and it was the worst service I ever received. The service in the plane everyone was very nice but the service you get when you’re doing your baggage is terrible. I had to pay $79 for a 22 pound bag. The lady who was checking out boarding pass to enter the plane was extremely disrespectful. Very loud and rude. I overheard lots of people complain about the service here in LaGuardia with Spirit. I won’t be flying ever again with Spirit as the service is horrible.,-1

I said no we will just drive let me cancel my flight i had earlier spoke to them about cancelling they said they would keep half my money refund the rest. I said ok, when do i get my money they then told me well we don't really refund it, we put it as a credit towards another flight, I ask whats my credit amount I was told you don't have a credit amount we are keeping all the money.",-1

I asked them how much will it cost. They answered it's free. So on the day of my flight I go to check in and they are saying I'm going to have to pay $79 for my bag. It didn't even cost that much to fly on their plane. So I told them what their people said that the bag would be free. Then they want to stand there and question me about who I talked to. Why would I lie about it. It's pretty sad in today's world everyone is guilty till proven innocent. This is my first and last time flying this airline. If I could have got a refund I would have and flown on a different airline.,-1

Delays and extra charges for everything!! We should have flown out of Redmond. The cheaper ticket out of Portland ended up costing more than the convenience of flying from home. Seats we paid for were not honored on our return flight. A child was in my seat (which was paid for by me) and i couldn't sit in it. Your paying for every little thing extra - coffee, seats carry ons etc.",-1
2022-09-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline I have ever seen,False,"  This is the worst airline I have ever seen. There is a fee for every thing, customer service is awful, their aircraft have uncomfortable seats. I had a small personal item, that didn't fit in their small container that they have to measure your bag, and since it didn't fit in there, they charged me $100 dollars for it. On top of that I have to pay to print my ticket, a lady with an attitude was putting pressure on me to hurry, take it or leave, because she had others people to take care.",-1
2022-09-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,do not recommend flying with Spirit,False,"  They told me in Las Vegas that my luggage would be at my final destination. Which it was not. They lost my bag, after 2 a week and a half they were finally able to locate it, after several hours in the phone speaking with supervisors. It has been two weeks not and still haven’t heard anything from them about them mailing me my luggage. I have called continuously trying to figure this out. Just to sit in hold and wait for an hour at a time just to be hung up on. I have called them twice today and got hung up on both times. This is absolutely ridiculous. I strongly do not recommend flying with Spirit.",-1
2022-09-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Consistently inconsistent,True, Las Vegas to Denver. Awful airline! I showed up 3:15hrs early for my flight. I was not allowed to change a checked bag to carry on because I purchased a “bundle”. So I had to wait in line for 2 hrs to check a bag that could have been a carry on. I then waited in a security line for 1:15 hrs making me have to sprint to the boarding gate to barely make it in time. When landing at connecting flight my flight changed gates making me walk across the entire airport. After waiting hours they decide to cancel our flight. When I get to the check out counter they give me a flight the next day with no option to refund or get a credit. Baffling why anyone would ever book with this airline. Consistently inconsistent. Now They cant find my luggage. I want to cry. I am a grown man going on my first vacation in 7 months and this experience has me broken frustrated to the max and almost in tears. Not a shred of help or compassion from the airline. I literally could have drove from Houston to Denver quicker. I will Forrest Gump it before I ever give this airline another dime of my money. I highly recommend using ANY other option possible to fly.,-1
2022-09-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,The service is horrible,False,"  I had a very bad experience with Spirit Airlines. It's a complete rip off. I ended up paying hundreds of dollars for just one trip. The agent tells you that you won't be paying for bags and you end up paying $160 for bags alone. The service is horrible. I was told that my flight was leaving at 7am. Got to the airport at 5am. Just to, be told that my flight is actually 10:40am. This is my first and last time riding this airline.",-1

2022-09-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Orlando,,,,,,,1.0,would only give me a partial credit,False,"  Had a live person help me book my flight and never received my confirmation so when I called I learned they had my wrong email address and the dates of my fight. They made me pay a fee to change the dates and fix my email. By changing the dates it cost my $2,000 more and when I tried to cancel they would only give me a partial credit since I was past my 24 hours. But I never received a confirmation since they had my wrong email. They then told me it would take 7 days to review the recording then it turned into 10 days. And that is business days and now after 10 business days they need to expedite this for a review. So I am assuming this is their way of saying we are not helping you.",-1
2022-09-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to Newark via Ft Lauderdale,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,2its inhumane customer service,True,"  I flew via Spirit Airlines several times over 5 years ago, with relatively okay experiences without any major complaints. However, this time around, Spirit Airlines really etched their poor reputation in my memory forever. My son, mother-in-law, and nephew and niece flew Spirit Airlines in September 2022 and their experience was horrible. My husband and I booked their tickets scheduled to fly from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Newark, NJ with a stop in Fort Lauderdale. The layover in Fort Lauderdale would be for 45 minutes. We figured this was an excellent one-stop trip since the layover was very short. However, at no moment did the airline warn us at any time during the checkout process that international luggage must be picked up and re-checked at the layover destination. When we booked the 4 tickets, we assumed that the luggage would go directly to Newark airport, but we were wrong. My mother-in-law did not find out they would need to pick up and re-check the luggage until she arrived at Fort Lauderdale. Remember, the layover was only 45 minutes; if we had known that they would have to re-check their luggage, we would have purchased a flight with a longer layover to give them ample time to recheck the luggage without missing the flight. Of course, my mother-in-law and the three children missed their flight. They had already been on the road since 11pm of the day prior, so this was really disappointing to discover. But the headache only began at the missed flight. My husband immediately called Spirit Airlines to try and get them into the next flight that would fly directly to Newark. The agent had the audacity to try to charge us $1,400 for 4 tickets to Newark when they never warned us the luggage would need to be re-checked. On top of this, the agent says not to worry since Spirit Airline would refund us the money through a voucher. A voucher. Has Spirit Airlines heard of inflation? Do they think that throwing $1,400 comes easy to the average family? What good is a voucher when I need cash to pay bills now? What good is a voucher for the very airline I am disappointed and disgusted by? The headache still does not end here either, unfortunately. Finally, the agent was able to book a later flight free of charge; however, the flight would make another stop in Orlando with a layover of 7 hours and land in Atlantic City, 3 hours away from our original home airport. You can imagine how these kids, ranging in age from 5-11 years old might have felt or how overwhelmed and exhausted my mother-in-law was, having to manage 3 kids for over 24 hours in 4 different airports. As I write this review, my mother-in-law, son, and niece/nephew are still on their way home from the airport and will arrive at approximately 1 in the morning with a total of 26 hours between the start of their voyage to the end. Upon booking, we wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and assumed that surely, people had above average expectations for an economy airline. Disappointingly, Spirit Airlines did live up to its poor reputation due to its inhumane customer service, lack of flexibility, exorbitant charges, and lack of transparency. At the very least, Spirit Airlines needs to warn international customers that they need to re-check their luggage at their layover destination and should keep this in mind when selecting their flight and not charge layover customers who miss their flight due to lack of time to re-check luggage. Shame on you Spirit.",-1
2022-09-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to New York,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,definitely no Spirit Airlines from now on,True," Where to start. I have always tried hard to like spirit airlines but this experience was the worst. I had round trip tickets from DTW to LGA and back. On my return trip, it was a 9.45 pm flight. I was there at 8.30 pm. The whole terminal was closed and there was no gate person to help us. How can it be there is no one to help us. Is that what a customer service is. There were 2 people in the kiosk area who said they don’t handle the gates and they don’t know where the person was. I waited and waited being optimistic and then the boarding time passed, still no help and obviously I missed the flight. I called the customer care to see what happened and they said that they can accommodate me for tomorrow but with an additional cost of 120 dollars for the error they made. That too even for a flight with a layover and a destination timing in the evening. I said no thank you and booked a flight through a different airline. Had to go to EWR from there and take a flight early next morning to reach Detroit on time. Such a hassle and purely avoidable situation. Please do better! For me definitely no Spirit Airlines from now on!",-1

I booked my flight over a month ago round trip from Fort Lauderdale to Santiago Dominican Republic but they overbooked the flight back which was at 2:40 am so they put me in standby after a lot of back in forth with a supervisor they finally put me to another flight in United at 2:40 pm going all the way to New Jersey and had to catch another one back to Miami which was my only option or staying at the airport for 3 extra days, they denied to put me into an hotel, a ride back to a friend house and the made it seems like it was my fault because I didn’t purchase a seat I called customer service to let them know about the situation but they were useless, because of their greed I missed my class and test and an entire day of work.",-1
2022-09-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Richmond,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,screenshot the error message,False,"  When you attempt to use the online portal to check in and it is down, the error message advises you to call into their reservations department. The reservations department, while kind and responsive, has not actually been provided the tools to actually check someone into their flight. They simply advise you that the best thing to do is to screenshot the error message to try to prove that you checked in online so that you are not charged at the counter, as you are charged an extra fee to use the Spirit Airlines services at the airport. This lack of functionality is absolutely absurd, because instead of checking in and walking straight to security, you are forced to wait in the crowd of people that it has also failed for and then fight to not be charged at the counter.",-1

We love losing a day in an airport,True," My husband and I are spending the day after Labor Day with our four kids stuck in an airport in Vegas because our Spirit flight from Atlanta was delayed. Apparently changing two tyres on an aircraft will do that! But it's ok... Spirit totally made our 6-7 hours stranded in the Harry Reid airport much better with a food voucher. Maybe if we split the food we can actually get to eat lunch and dinner since we'll be here in this airport for the entire day. Who needs the entire trip anyway? We love losing a day in an airport. Fingers crossed that the rental car company is still open when we get to our destination HOURS after we were supposed to. We don't even mind that no one will pick up the chat when we try to go for customer service. But when I did call and talk to an actual person, they just sent me right back to the chat. Talking to representatives in person at the airport is about as helpful as talking to the paper towel machine in the restroom here. We found the slot machines to be more friendly and understanding. Too bad we don't gamble. Such a great time with our first experience flying Spirit.",-1

First time using Spirit and it has been nothing but problem after problems. Flight delayed for mechanical issues. Missed connecting flight. Hotel and meal vouchers given for having to stay in Las Vegas until another flight was available did not work. Being billed for additional cost due to Spirit not having things together and giving out invalid vouchers. Extremely unprofessional company.,-1

The check in counter agents were extremely rude, loudly stating that everyone needs to self check in and if anyone doesn’t they’ll pay an extra 10$ for them to help even though this is their job! Moreover they charged me 80$ for my carry on. which was delayed for 3 days. With no compensation, when asked about the bag they had no idea where it was. And luckily I had an airtag or else I would’ve never found my bag! The bathroom was disgusting.",-1

By the time you’re done paying for luggage on you, you have already paid more than the next cheapest airline. Might as well pay a little more at the time of reservation and not deal with this poor excuse for an airline. Service horrible. They have even lowered their max weight for checked-in luggage to 40lbs. The only airline that has done this. I paid $74 to check in my luggage. Then for 2 lbs over 40 allotted lbs. I paid $59.  Don’t fall for the gimmick and a few dollars of saving.",-1

At 12:30am on 9/2/22, I began to have low blood sugar and had to get help. At Gate I was told to go to Ticket Center at Checkin for rescheduling and cancelling. I went there and no one was there.

After not accepting our tries to check on line in PHL airport we were put on stand by - luckily we made it but in the way back Spirit just took us out of passenger list. After real fight with service desk which was questioning our documented tickets purchase it end up in managers office and positive result. I understand ticket was $220 but later carry on $160 both ways made spirit very expensive experience. I don’t blame workers - just a system is set up to put customer on edge,-1
2022-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles via Las Vegas,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,baggage is absolutely too expensive,False,"  First of all, baggage is absolutely too expensive. Spirit is supposed to be an economy airline however, by the time you pay for baggage, water or basic snacks you may as well fly one of the more accommodating airlines. Next, I requested a wheelchair, this request was totally ignored, my 91-year-old mother struggled to get to TSA as I tried to get assistance from various personnel, I was told they could not help. Finally, I confiscated an idle wheelchair and pushed it myself. It was a horrible experience. Will never fly Spirit and will encourage everyone I know to choose another airline.",-1

I paid 85 for each ticket (85 one way and 85 return) for a family emergency I wanted to change your according to them for the change and the difference in cost was 182.78 one way and 112 return. His employee she had no way of helping me because I accepted the terms... needless to say I traveled with them almost monthly.  Estas obligado a comprar su seguro, si no compras el seguro y pides cambio de fecha te cobran de doble . Pague 85 por cada pasaje (85 ida y 85 vuelta) por una emergencia familiar quise cambie tu según ellos por el cambio y la diferencia de costo era 182.78 ida y 112 regreso.

After dealing with the poor customer service at the desk, the rude and pushy behavior of staff and finally being charged an additional 120 dollars in fees, not to mention the 100 dollars for 2 bag checked in, I now understand why so many customers avoid Spirit like the plague. My family will never again fly Spirit. It is better to pay more for Delta. Spirit is not worth the agony.",-1
2022-08-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,I am done with them,False,"  I have flown Spirit 5 times now. Or should say I have tried to fly Spirit 5 times. Out of those 5 times they have canceled 2 flights on me. The latest one was this past Tuesday, August 23rd, 2022. They canceled the flight 10 minutes before it was supposed to leave. This last trip was, to put it mildly, a trip from hell with Spirit. We were supposed to leave from Manchester, NH. After canceling the flight they offered us an Uber ride to Logan Airport in Boston and a $21.00 food voucher. We opted to take the flight out of Logan that was leaving at 8:10 pm. 7 hours from our original departure. They had to re-ticket us for this Boston flight and that took over 2 hours in line to do. After getting to Logan the flight that was supposed to leave at 8:10 was delayed until 8:50 pm. I wish I could say that was the end of this horror show but it was not. I could not getting the boarding pass to come up on the app on my phone. It told me I needed to go to the gate to get the pass. The pass printed but said I was not allowed any bags on the flight. I had one carry on that I took down to Myrtle but was told I could not take it on the flight home unless I paid $93.00. I tried to explain, to no avail, that my original ticket allowed me one carry on but got nowhere after 10 minutes of back and forth. Finally I was told, in a very surly way, that I could either pay the $93.00 or not get on the plane. The adage ""You get what you pay for"" should have a picture of a Spirit airplane underneath it. Proceed with caution when booking with Spirit. I am done with them.",-1

2022-08-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines is a disgrace,True,"  Spirit Airlines is a disgrace. Today I am flying back from NY to Florida, for family visit. On the way from Florida to NY, my bag was 6 pounds overweight.  They had the nerve to charge me twice the original cost of the bag ($30) for the overage. $60 for being 6 pounds overweight.  Then over the next two days I spent 4 hours collectively, on the phone with customer service, trying to get them to refund my money, or at least credit me for part of it. On the way home, I decided to bring a surfboard that I had in NY, to Florida with me. So I called Spirit Airlines 3 days ago, prior to bringing the surfboard to the airport. I explained the dimensions, weight and content, and I was told it it will charged as regular luggage. I was skeptical, so I asked for confirmation, and I was assured by the genius on the other end that I had no reason to be concerned. I happily paid the requested $60 for my surfboard. Well guess what? When I arrived at the airport today, they banged me for $46 additional for the surfboard. And then to add insult to injury, they refused to hear anything I had to say. Either I pay the $46, or take the surfboard elsewhere.",-1
2022-08-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Las Vegas via Portland,,,,,,1.0,2.0,Don't fly Spirit,False,"  My good friend, Noelle, flew with them a week ago. She had come down to Houston to fit me for my wedding dress and to make adjustments to what she had made so far. On her return flight, the plane was late taking off. They did not inform the receiving airport that they were late, so none of the connecting flights were warned. When they finally landed and my friend and a number of other passengers ran for their connecting flight, they were told it had left. In actuality, it was still on the ground, in total view, and they simply didn't want to go through the process of reopening the boarding tunnel (the plane doors were not closed yet). Initially, Spirit had changed Noelle's flight to another one while she was in the air, but she was able to convince them to let her and the other passengers board. But her bag had been sent to the other flight and Spirit has a policy that they won't load bags if the passenger wasn't on the flight. So her bag didn't arrive. When she asked for it, they gave her attitude for taking her original flight and when she got fed up and argued with them, they told her to go home and they'd call if they found the bag. A day later and no response and she returned to the airport to ask- they had written down that she was a difficult customer in her record and when she complained again and lost her temper (admittedly problematic), the attendant told her in leaving that he hoped my wedding day was ruined. It's been a week. They've either lost or are purposely keeping my wedding dress. Don't fly Spirit.",-1

You will ended paying more in all the other extras and everything is far all their services are separate and they are the last ones for everything.

2022-08-25,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Baltimore,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,4.0,responding with urgency and with so much care,False,"  My husband and I recently flew with Spirit to go on a cruise for our family vacation. On our way back to fly into BWI, my husband began to feel ill. During the check in process, my husband fainted while in MCO airport. Needless to say it was a very overwhelming situation. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 1:05 pm while boarding was 12:20 pm. At this point we were cutting it close to catch our flight. Once he regained consciousness, there was a cop and a nurse practitioner in line who were extremely helpful. They didn't leave my husband's side for one second. They both made sure paramedics and the ambulance was called. While all the craziness was unfolding, the Spirit Airlines staff were trying to help me figure out the next steps as they knew we were going to miss our flight. They provided him with water as he became feverish and dehydrated. The supervisor on duty made sure that my husband was in good hands before he pulled me to the side to discuss flight arrangements. Once we got the confirmation that my husband was going to be hospitalized he immediately got on the phone to work out flight details. One of the young ladies noticed that I had so many people surrounding me asking me questions that she politely pulled me to the side to offer suggestions on how she could help to make this process easier for me and how I could get to the hospital. She was my guardian angel. The supervisor didn't have a confirmed flight at the time but he assure me that once I was settled and my husband was ok, that I should call customer service to get booked for our next flight home. He said that he would have detailed notes in our chart so that it wouldn't be a hassle to deal with it. Sure enough once I called that night to get our flight rescheduled, EVERYTHING was taken care of and we were booked to fly home the next day. No problems, no questions. I say all that to say, we are extremely grateful for Spirit Airlines for responding with urgency and with so much care.",1
2022-08-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Florida,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst Airline ever,False,"  Worst Airline ever. Had to fly family members up for a family emergency. First flight had to be cancelled because of illness. Second flight booked at time of cancellation. Spirit indicated members were no shows on the first flight. Then charge me $400 to change the flight without telling anyone. They refused to put the money back on my credit card. They advertise they are cheap flights but neglect to tell you they add on fees more than the flight itself. Unfortunately this was the only airline available for such short notice. The customer service representative, Daniel was not knowledgeable but also rude. Would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. I know how to pay them double for what was supposed to be a cheap flight. Never again. I'll spend the extra money with a better airline in the future. Lesson learned on my part. Their customer service and compassion toward their customer is horrible.",-1
2022-08-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1.0,cheap prices are not worth the headaches,False,"  Our flight was scheduled to leave at 10:17 am, but it was initially delayed by one hour after a flight attendant failed to arrive on time, leaving the plane below the minimum number of crew. A few minutes later we were told our flight was delayed an additional 4 hours without reason. Even though other spirit flights had available seats at the airport we could not go on them because our bags were still on the delayed plane. The only compensation we received was a food voucher worth $21. Spirit’s lack of communication left us confused and upset and I believe that the cheap prices are not worth the headaches the company causes.",-1

They don't care about their customers. I tried to get my flight switched to an earlier flight on the same day. The earlier flight showed many open spots available online. I asked them to just move me up to the earlier flight time since there was open spots and they said yes for a $250 charge! Absolutely ridiculous! Why can't they just move me up since open seats were available?,-1
2022-08-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Kansas City,,,,,,1.0,1.0,missed the check-in time,False,"  First experience with this airline, and it will be my last. My mother-in-law didn't make her flight (she missed check-in time by 8 minutes) which is frustrating enough, but what's even worse is calling up the airline to see if there was anything we could do, and being told the we should pay $289 to get a $205 credit through them for a $500 flight. Ridiculous. Didn't even miss the flight,  missed the check-in time and we should pay more to be forced to use them again. At least the airline won't last long with their ""let's screw our customers over even more"" attitude.",-1

2022-08-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst experience with an airline,True,"  This was the worst experience with an airline I have ever had. First, the flight was delayed 40ish min. We were already arriving to Vegas very late, and wanted to still have time to do something once we got there. Then, it was delayed another 40 min. At this point we are already at the airport, where each staff member we encountered at the Sacramento airport was extremely confrontational & rude. We got to our gate and we were among over 100 people waiting for this flight. We waited another hour to even see our plane pull into the gate. Then we still had to wait for the passengers and luggage from the previous flight to get off board. It was probably another 30 min, then we started boarding. Once we had all boarded, there was another delay and we were sitting there all onboard this flight with no idea if it would ever take off for at least 45 min. The flight attendants (all except one) were very rude and made excuse after excuse as to why this was happening. At this point most of the passengers on board were either about to have a panic attack or start screaming. I have never in my life experienced such bad anxiety. Finally we took off, and I started crying on board the plane because the whole experience start to finish had been so stressful && scary. Honestly scary. I vowed to NEVER again fly Spirit Airlines, or even if her fly out of the Sacramento airport again.",-1

They managed to lose my 2 years olds stroller on the way to Puerto Rico from Atlanta & on the way back managed to lose my child’s car seat from Puerto Rico to Atlanta.

This became my fault not spirits, they didn’t have any other flights leaving that day, and I had to book with a whole different company. They’re very unprofessional, rude, and didn’t seem to care about their customers at all. They didn’t even have a customer service at the airport to help me, I had to constantly keep calling on the phone and talk to someone who barley spoke English. I wouldn’t even rate them they’re that bad.",-1

I had to book a very last min flight to FLL for a dire family emergency. My flight was scheduled to take off at 7:08pm landing at 9:08pm. I had to work today (8/17/2022) so this flight time was most ideal to ensure I would make it to me family. Spirit delayed the flight 5 times as I’m typing this I am still sitting in ATL airport with no plane on sight. I call spirit customer service in tears, the customer service rep let me know that it was a controllable issues (plane maintenance). Does spirit airlines only have 1 plane? They had more than enough time to find another plane to accommodate paying customers.  But to justify the 5 delays due to plane maintenance is unacceptable unless you truly have 1 plane for every airport in the United States. I asked the customer service rep is I can be put on another flight and she informed me that there were no other flights for today or any other planes to accommodate that we had to wait for the maintenance to be complete. After 5 delays it is now a thunderstorm, which only gives spirit another excuse to further delay paid customers whom are tired, hungry, overwhelmed and just ready to get to our destination.  I can go on and on but at the end of the day spirit won’t change. I am angry and I will do all I can to make sure my anger is felt in every way.",-1

2022-08-18,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Orlando via Myrtle Beach,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,good experience was pure luck,False,"  Our flight was a Spirit airlines flight to Orlando via Myrtle Beach. We arrived at LaGuardia at around 5:30 in the morning for our scheduled 6:59 departure. The terminal at LaGuardia was somewhat disappointing to me. I expected it to be much bigger, the terminal only had about 6 gates which included a small restaurant, snack area and a Dunkin’ donuts. We flew aboard a A320, and the airplane was old. You could tell that it was old because of its “Blue livery” not the classic yellow livery we are used to seeing on Spirit. This meant that the A320 had older seats which where more comfortable than the new cramped seats. We took off on time and headed to Myrtle Beach. The crew was amazing! After landing from LaGuardia we boarded our A319 flight bound for Orlando. The airplane featured Spirits signature yellow livery. We sat in the seats just behind first class. Great flight and we took off on time at around 10:30! We even arrived 27 minutes early. The good: Both flights took off on time. Our flight from MYR to MCO arrived 27 minutes early The seats on both planes had spacious legroom 4) Crew was extremely friendly and allowed my aspiring son who wants to become a pilot go into the cockpit before takeoff. The bad: Seats were dirty, but now a days most airplane seats are dirty. NO IFE! Wifi is available for purchase! Spirits Terminal at LGA is old and small, nothing compared to the new terminal Delta has. The tray table on the A319 flight from MYR to MCO was extremely small, can not hold your computer/ipad. They make you pay for your luggage no matter what! Be prepared to shell out at least $74 per luggage. Even carry ons! Would I fly Spirit again? Yes. But I think that this good experience was pure luck since we flew on a older A320 and our seats on the A319 were in the first economy seats behind First Class. When flying Spirit fly in the morning when it is rare you will be delayed. But if I had no other options left and I couldn’t fly on Delta, American or United (basically the legacy carriers in America) I’d chose Spirit instead of Southwest or Frontier.",1

2022-08-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst airline experience I have ever had,True," Worst airline experience I have ever had. I’ve flown for many years on basically every single domestic airline and finally had to choose a Spirit flight as it was the cheapest available. I’m used to budget airlines nickel and diming you for everything, but it’s normally avoidable and still possible to have an enjoyable experience. Not with Spirit. They don’t let you take any carry on bags, which again I’ve experienced before, but they charge an absurd amount for bags! Ridiculously expensive to the point where paying for one single bag, carry on or checked, is almost the same price as a flight. There was a massive accident on my way to the airport that was going to cause me to miss my flight, call them and have never been so shocked to be told it’s a $99 change fee plus difference in airfare, no refund possible. Most other airlines are much more accommodating and understanding than Spirit’s outsourced Indian customer service reps. Awful experience and will never try them out again nor recommend them to anyone.",-1
2022-08-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,243 dollars just for luggage,False,"  I traveled by spirit airlines from Santo Domingo to Miami, I paid for my suitcase online and when I got to the airport, they told me that I only paid for the hand luggage, I paid 77 dollars for the hand luggage. (I had never paid for my hand luggage in other airlines) I tell the girl who attended me that I had already paid and she very arrogantly tells me that I still need to pay for the main suitcase. He tells me that it is 116 dollars, but that my suitcase has 4 extra pounds and that I have to pay 50 dollars more, 166 in total. I explained to him that I didn't know that carry-on bags had to be paid for and he told me that this is the company's rule. In total I paid 243 dollars just for luggage, almost half of my round trip flight. I think it's not fair for them to do that. Apparently one has to travel with a backpack. I will never travel by this airline even if they have free flights. They are scammers. Yo viajé por spirit airlines desde Santo Domingo hacia Miami, pagué mi maleta en línea y cuando llegué al aeropuerto, me dicen que yo solo pagué el equipaje de mano, pagué 77 dólares por el equipaje de mano. ( yo nunca había pagado mi equipaje de mano en otras aero linea) Le digo a la chica que me atendió, que ya yo había pagado y ella muy arrogante me dice que falta pagar la maleta principal. Me dice que son 116 dolares, pero que mi maleta tiene 4 libras de más y que tengo que pagar 50 dolares más, 166 en total. Le explico que yo no sabia que la maleta de mano se pagaba y me dijo que esa es la regla de la compañía. En total pagué 243 dolares solo de equipaje, casi la mitad de mi vuelo ida y vuelta. Yo considero que no es justo que hagan eso. Aparentemente uno tiene que viajar con una mochila. Jamás viajaré por esta aerolínea aunque tengan los vuelos regalados. Son unos estafadores.",-1
2022-08-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta,,,,,,,1.0,All in all a horrible experience,True,"  About a month ago I received an email that Spirit canceled my flight and took it upon themselves to move me to a day later. This would make me miss my transfer from the airport that I prepaid for and the first day of my $3000.00/ Three day retreat. I spent an hour on hold and talking to a representative to eventually move my flight to November 1 so I could at least not miss the retreat. This meant my friend who was also going and booked separately had to contact Spirit as well and spend the same amount of time trying to move her flight to the 1st and try to secure the seat next to mine like we originally had. I then had to go and pay for a hotel room in Puerto Vallarta the night of the 1st due to them canceling my flight, forcing me to go a day earlier. An extra expense I have to eat- But hey, at least I will make it to my retreat. Nope. Not the case. Received an email today that you canceled my flight on November 1.  Called and went through the queue and automated prompts to finally get a live person. This live agent proceeds to tell me that the flight was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances. I asked what those circumstances were and he couldn’t tell me. Later in the call he tells me that I was the one who called and canceled my flight.  I literally laughed out loud and asked him if I was in the twilight zone. Then later in the conversation the reason the flight was canceled was something entirely different. It was due to a schedule change. He told me I could get a spirit credit. No thanks! What on earth makes you think I would want a credit on this horrible airline that repeatedly cancels peoples reservations and just chooses when their vacation will start and/or end by putting them on whatever flight they so choose? I told him that he would need to find me an alternate flight for the same price because flights were now between $1500 and $1700. He put me on hold (again) for an eternity. Probably wasn’t doing any checking but was sitting there playing a video game or having a snack I would guess. Because every time he put me on hold and came back he had no new information for me but would feed me some different story, almost as if he forgot what he had already told me. This time however, he suddenly tells me that they will go ahead and reinstate my reservation since I’m telling them I didn’t cancel it and the flight is available. What?!!!! In the hell is going on?!!! By this point I just decided to cut my losses and tell him I wanted my money back in the original form of payment as opposed to a spirit credit. I will take my chances with flights going down so that I can go to my retreat. All in all a horrible experience.",-1

We could never purchase the bags via there website because of issues with there website so we had no choice but to purchase in airport for a ridiculous amount. We tried several times and could never complete the purchase online so we go to the desk and they tell us they will charge us an additional 10 dollars per passenger since we did not use the Kiosk to check in. We said we would go to the kiosk to do this but could we come back without doing (a 45 minute line) to do so since we already did it, but the attendant said no. We would have to do the line again which in effect would make us miss our flight. Of course she knew this and knew we could not do this .. so $10pp gone.. plus charges for overhead, for bags ended being $350. Our flight got delayed, so we need to spend the night in Vegas, but got no help, no hotel, nothing -  they basically just told us to go talk to the wall. I will never fly this airline again, it is the worst airline you can imagine.. If you want to fly with Spirit to save money, I can tell you don't.",-1

Forced to stay on a plane for close to 2 hours before we finally took off. Which then caused me to miss my connection flight in Vegas and they couldn’t do anything for me. Told me politely kick rocks and wait for the next flight, which is 3 days out mind you. They wouldn’t offer a full refund and offered absolutely no accommodations for the fact they made me miss my flight and left stranded in Vegas for 3 days. Never fly with these people.

I was on my way back from a Trip visiting my son so at that point it was my 4th flight in a week. I had no issues with my bag on the 3 other flights. But as we were boarding Spirit Airlines from LAS to SLC I was told that I was getting charged $98 for my bag (the only bag i had) it was literally the last money i had for the month since i am on a fixed income. What was worse was watching what happened to 2 other passengers that were supposed to be on my same flight. These passengers had trekking poles (collapsible walking sticks) They told them that they could not get on the flight unless they paid for both walking sticks. They explained they didn’t have any money and it was a layover flight, unfortunately the last I saw them, one of them was crying because they couldn’t get on the flight. I will avoid any trip that has even a 10 minute flight with Spirit Airlines",-1

I even received an email the day before the flight with an advertised discounted rate for checked bags. However, when I clicked on the link in the email, it took me to the website where the price was $17 higher for each checked bag!! To add insult to injury, when I called to ask for assistance, I was told that if the agent helped me it would actually cost more. Bottom line, Spirit Airlines does not honor their posted prices or the prices quoted in their promotional emails. Do not be fooled by their “lower prices”.",-1

I fly my giant family back home often, we have been loyal Spirit customers for quite some time now. I was booking a trip today, 7 tickets to go round trip for the weekend. I attempted to book through the app as I typically do, but the app was having issues. I got out my computer, I went through all the steps again, entering flight information for all 7 passengers, and when I proceeded to the checkout, the website was having difficulty and prompted me to call customer service. I called customer service and told them the issues I was having and they said they would book it no problem, but there was a problem-as far as I am concerned. They intended to charge me and extra $175 ($25/passenger) for booking over the phone. I requested that they removed the charge as their website and app weren't working properly and I am a very loyal customer. They said they could give me $75 off. That I would still be stuck with a $100 fee for booking over the phone. I told them no and I will never book with Spirit again. I spend anywhere from $10,000-$15,000 per year on flights alone and I will take my business elsewhere. I booked with Frontier using their website that worked properly and the comparable flight was $400 less than I would have spent through Spirit anyway.",-1

I had to go back to pay the package. Wait in line when it's my turn to see the flight information on the screen. He told me he was late. I missed my trip that day. I spoke to the Spirit Airlines staff who told me it couldn't be anything. He made me pay another $99 to leave the next day with a layover in Newark bound for Orlando, Florida. Paying the $100, they did not change the day of return. I missed my trip on July 28th trip on July 29th arriving in Orlando in the early hours of July 30th. I also had to pay $89 dollars for my suitcase. To return on July 30 to pr at 10pm. An expense of $247 my first ticket which lost the flight because of the staff of the airport of San Juan pr. Pay $99.00 to take another trip as a layover. And another additional $89. It is not fair that Spirit Airlines is doing this to the passengers. I made a trip which I could not solve anything. Even paying the layover, the airport staff did not change me on the day of return. Travel to orlando in the early hours of saturday july 30th to leave the same night at 10pm. Very upset with this situation of spirit of your incompetent staff.  Estoy escribiendo piqué tube un contratiempo con la línea de spirit yo salía para orlando fl en julio 28 y al llegar al airport de San Juan pr. El personal me dijo q tendría que pagar mi bulto q era un bulto de espalda. Tube q regresar a pagar el bulto. Espere una fila cuando me toco mi turno al pibe roa información en la pantalla.

2022-08-09,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this airline is terrible,True,  Do not Fly on this Joke of an Airline. You can take one carry on per passenger as long as it fits in this metal display it is considered a carry on. We left San Diego with no problem. Coming back to San Diego from Vegas was another story. We are boarding with the same bag we left with in San Diego and were stopped by this rude lady upon entering the Plane and she said that was not a carry on. When we went to the metal display like before it fit no problem which we showed the lady. She said it looked heavy and we had to pay an additional $89.00. So instead of missing our flight we paid it and called the corporate office when we landed. Safe to say this airline is terrible and the customer service is just as bad,-1
2022-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orange County to Pittsburgh via Las Vegas,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,does not care about its customers,True,"  This airline does not care about its customers! My flight from Orange County to Las Vegas was delayed and arrived to Vegas a few minutes before my flight to Pittsburgh was scheduled to depart. I was at the gate a couple of minutes before Pittsburgh flight scheduled departure, but the door was already closed. There were 12 of us on the Orange County flight scheduled to fly to Pittsburgh, but Spirit chose not to wait for us a few minutes. The airline rescheduled us for other flights, mostly on the next day, and did NOT provide any vouchers claiming the cause of delay was weather (even though the agent at the gate assured us that the vouchers would be issued). Had to spend the night in Vegas (hotel, food, transportation). The next day the flight to Pittsburgh was delayed, kept the door open well past its scheduled departure time and allowed a couple of connecting passengers in. Those were probably not late due to weather and Spirit would've had to reimburse their ""delay"" costs. Spirit customer service reviewed my complaint for several weeks and refused to reimburse my expenses in Vegas. Although, judging by their letter, not sure they even read my complaint. So, stay away from Spirit - they may seem cheaper, but get really expensive if something goes wrong!",-1
2022-08-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,,,,,,,1.0,not allowing me to apply the voucher,True,"  Don't waste your time plus money just looking at the price. Sprit Airlines doesn't maintain the time or don't bother about the passengers concern, they have very rude customer service at the airport. I have flown 7-8 trips within 3 months, except 1 trip all the trips delayed or cancelled. I was supposed to fly on May 30th from IAH to EWR, flight delayed 4-5 times and end of the day it got cancelled and rescheduled after 3 days. They tried to shut the customers and gave $50 voucher when i tried to apply now it will not allow me to apply it shows me to change the date, i have tried different dates from past 2 hours it is not allowing me to apply the voucher. I called customer service to help me with this voucher their answer is you need to apply for class A, Class B and so on. Where is the class a, b, c how do i know which class flight i am flying on, there is no where mentioned in the voucher that you have to fly on the specific class. if they are not allowing to apply the voucher why in the first place offer this kind vouchers to cheat customers.  I tried to book my flight to use this voucher with this airline at once and never fly this airline. surprisingly they don't allow 50 pounds where as all the airlines allow 50 pounds for checked bag.",-1

No customer service, no matter which way you contact them (email, automated text, phone customer support). Do not expect any answer to your concerns. I booked a flight for the 7th July 2022 on June 28th. 10 days prior to the flight I had to cancel it the same day I booked it, so I used their text assistant to do so, which confirmed that my request for a refund was registered and that I would get a full refund in the next 7 business days (cf photo screenshot attached). Nope, I got a confirmation ticket that my flight was booked two days before the flight. Then I went over the phone, emails and all sort of useless procedures all that to get flight credits usable before October of this year. Their automated customer support system basically lied about the fact that my cancellation request was confirmed all, that to take the money. Bad spirit. Very bad.",-1
2022-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to New York,,,,,,,1.0,no remorse at all from their employees,False,"  Suppose to fly out of Niagara Falls 6pm on Aug 5th, my wife checked the reservation the night before and everything was all set. The morning of our flight my wife brings up the reservation and shows it’s canceled due to Spirit not flying out of Niagara Falls anymore. The decision by Spirit did not just happen the morning of our flight so our flight should of been canceled a long time ago not the day of. I called and there was no remorse at all from their employees and said refund could take 7-10 days. I can’t believe that this airline can actually do this to people. We found a flight out of Buffalo the next morning but had to change ALL reservations like hotel and vehicle. Jetblue just took over Spirit so I won’t fly either until this is fixed. By the way our new flight with American Airlines ended up cheaper with everyone getting a carry on",-1

Representatives are careless, they do not appreciate nobody’s business, from supervisors to managers they do not care if you make it to your destination or not.

Agents were late to counter. Half a dozen people in line, 3 agents behind counter, servicing nobody. Turns out travellers must check in their own bags. There are big friendly kiosks, but no signage telling anyone what the process is. Especially frustrating for new travellers, or anyone who hasn't used Spirit before. Which, in this case, is everyone since it's Spirits second day at the airport. Want to chose your seat? Add $20. In addition, Spirit want to charge additional for carry ons. Apparently $70 for my checked bag wasn't enough. On a 1 hour flight from ABQ to Vegas, they also want to charge for beverages. Additionally, my flight was delayed one hour. Apparently they're waiting for a pilot flying in from San Diego. Anyone ever hear that one before? I have. The last time I flew through Vegas to be exact. Is this a thing here? Aircraft was newish. Clean. Stiff and uncomfortable. No charging ports for electronics. Air travel is usually the worst part of anyone's vacation. Spirit has just figured out how to make it even less enjoyable. Keep in mind, any money you ""save"" on ticket price (I didn't save anything) they bleed back out of you at every turn.",-1

I contacted the airline and the staff had listed me as a no show, when I was there 2 hours before the flight departed. So they would not issue me a refund or give me flight credit. I had proof I was there because I took Uber there, and back home, i checked in at the kiosk and spoke to an attendant at the check in counter. They wouldn't hear anything I was saying. The staff didn't do their job. And they wanted me to to pay a total of $150 to check one bag.",-1
2022-08-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Myrtle Beach via Detriot,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0, my file was closed without resolution,True,"  I flew Spirit from Phoenix to Myrtle Beach via Detroit in April of 2022. When arriving in Myrtle Beach, I was informed that my luggage was back in Detroit and it would be at least 24 hours before they could retrieve it and get it to me. They gave me a yellow business card (voucher) to go out and purchase clothing and instructed me to ""be reasonable"" with my purchase. I did just that and submitted the requested documents required for reimbursement. Here we are in August of 2022 and I was informed that my file was ""closed"" without resolution and without any form of communication as to why they did not honor this justified claim after 4 long months. Beware of this airline folks! If you lose your bags/ luggage and they tell you they will make this right, do not believe them!!! It makes me sick that you pay good money for these tickets and the airline does not follow up or honor what they stated they would!",-1
2022-08-03,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Santiago,3.0,1.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,definitely fly Spirit again,False,"  I have flown Spirit in the past and will say out of all airlines, Spirit is my least favorite. My friend bought my ticket for this trip and of course chose the cheapest and most convenient airline. Needless to say, I was not very happy. However, I actually ended up having a wonderful experience. On July 14, 2022 I flew from FLL to SCL on a red eye. The flight attendant, Leonda, who sat near us helped with my anxiety from flying. She was very friendly and talked with me throughout the flight. She distracted me from my fear of flying and she did a great job of it. I just want to thank her so much for being so kind that night. She probably doesn't realize that her demeanor and kindness really help those who hate flying. I would definitely fly Spirit again. Hopefully there will be more people like her on my next flight.",1

While on mid-flight, we were offered to apply for the Spirit Mastercard and if approved we would receive 60,000 bonus points and an extra 1,000 points just for applying. I was approved and was sent my card via mail almost a month later. We were never told that in order to obtain those points we had to spend over $1000. I contacted customer service and was rudely told that I should have read the fine print. I feel like this offer was not explained properly and I hope this gets corrected so someone like me isn't blindsided by the “fine print”.",-1

Would not recommend Spirit at all. The checkin process at the airport was terrible and staff was not helpful. Charges for checking bags was way too much During flight the flight attendants were rude, loud and inattentive. They kept talking loud without any concentrations of passenger sitting around them. I was not able to rest for a little bit as I was sitting in the last row and could hear them. They could care less about their work and just engaged in personal conversations. I would never fly with this airline.",-1

Rep on the chat stated I would be given a reservation credit and would be receiving an email within 60 mins because I provided proof. Well that never happened. I texted them back asking they stated they could not find me in the system and that I needed to call in. I called waited 40 mins on hold. Once they finally answered they told me my trip was never cancelled and that they needed to escalate it. While the rep was going to transfer me he hung up on me. I am calling again now and I am still on hold. I have proof from the spirit message/text from the rep telling me I would have a reservation refund. I had also booked with Delta to fly back and they were able to help me right away No issues with Delta. Save your money don't book through Spirit. I highly doubt I will be able to get anyone to help if they do I’ll post again with a status.,-1

I was warned not to use Spirit but we ignored the warning and we paid double for the mistakes of the airline. Our flight was cancelled on our way back by the airline without a notification; our connecting flights were wrong and the lay over they wanted to give me was over 17 hours. Their solution was sleep in the airport from 8pm-until 1:55pm the next day. I got tired of being after hung-up on. I called 8 times and finally I gave up and I asked them to reimburse me and I was given half for their mistakes. I had to book a last minute flight with United Airlines and because it was last minute it cost me double. Please listen to my warning and do not fly Spirit. I wish I would had listen to my aunt and all of the awful reviews I read. Good luck to whoever ignores this review.,-1

I attempted to get the fee credited back with much hassle and was not helped. They offered credit towards the next flight and gave me other options for other baggage claims. But what does credit do? Nothing. Any other airline I have used refunded little things with no hassle. Yet it is against Spirit's policy. Very unhappy with this experience I will choose differently next time.,-1

On 7/24/22 I had a flight back home to Saint Louis at 3.15 pm. On the way to returning our rental car we were involved in an accident which caused us a delay in getting to the airport in a timely manner. My family of 5 arrived to the airport around 2.40 pm in which the airplane was still at the airport. I went to the counter after I was unable to check in at the kiosk due to the time (I had already done online check in and paid for our bags). Once I went to the counter the rep was very rude and nonchalant as I told her why I had arrived late (I was all bandaged up, it was very obvious I had been in ""something""). My 72 year old mom was distraught yet the rep did not care. She told me we were too late to board. I then ask if she could call the gate and make sure, she placed a call yet to be honest I dont believe she truly did, however she told us it was too late for us to board and that there were no more flights leaving for the day. Last flight at 3pm in a busy city such as Las Vegas! In the airport there are all sorts of issues one will encounter with traveling and people need to learn how to deal with them or not be in that line of work. It takes patience, compassion and understanding, none of which she had. I ended spending 3 times more to fly with Southwest and to be honest if the flight was free I would never fly Spirit again or recommend it to anyone I know! Do you know how that made my children feel witnessing that kind of low down rudeness? I lost out out on a paid flight and paid luggage and couldn't even be accommodated for another flight until 7/26.",-1
2022-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Atlanta,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,customer service has been atrocious,True,"  I don't blame Spirit for the actual delay as that was weather related. However their customer service has been atrocious. From the lack of knowledge about procedure and inability to properly instruct confused first time flyers as to the delay protocol to the Nasty reception I received when I finally arrived at Las Vegas, absolutely ridiculous. I have no hopes the the next part of my flight will go without issue and I will never fly Spirit again. I have never received such poor treatment in my life. They give a whole new meaning to ""you get what you pay for"".",-1
2022-07-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no good thing about traveling with Spirit,True,"  I cannot over state just how horrible traveling with Spirit Airlines is. It is often the little things that make an airline a good one. Spirit has found anything that might be good, and completely destroyed it with expensive charges. There is no good thing about traveling with Spirit. The staff is extremely rude and are trained to extort money from travelers. The seats, aside from being the smallest I have ever seen, are like those on a subway. Hard without padding. Seats lack even the basic comfort of plastic lawn furniture. No cup holders or even a place to set down your phone. Not that this matters, because you will pay a crazy fee to even turn on your phone. The airline provides no refreshments to include even a cup of tap water to take medication. They claim to offer a free “small” carry on bag. This is more literal than you might think. If your bag is larger than a purse, the gate guards will charge you for it. I have flown many discount airlines in the last 20 years and this one is without any doubt the worst.",-1

Every flight I have taken on spirit leaves at least 15 minutes after departure time and boarding is never on time. You'd think could get it right once or twice but don't count on it. Out flight was delayed due to weather and there was only one announcement made and no updates for about an hour. This is not an airline I would recommend. They can easily put you in a bad mood for your trip as there customer service is no better.,-1
2022-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Burbank via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,how they treat customers that cannot speak English,True,"  On July 8, I took my 62-year-old father and my nephew to the John Glenn International Airport in Columbus, Ohio for their returning trip to Burbank, with a stopover in Las Vegas. My father doesn't speak English and because he was traveling with my 4 year old nephew, he asked me to go with him to help at the front desk printing their boarding pass. Although we encountered traffic due to a car accident, we arrived exactly at 2.45 pm if not 2 minutes earlier. I had to wait for the customer service (a lady) to help us and when she arrived she asked if we had luggage with us, but I told her we did not and that my father was leaving, not me. She asked if we had the boarding pass but I told her we did not and that's what we were there for! Then she immediately told me that my father had missed his flight and we had to make another reservation for a different flight. She asked another colleague for confirmation then she told me that we didn't arrive 45 minutes prior the flight, so they didn't want to print the boarding pass. She told me it was 2.47 pm, I pointed out that we were there before that time, perhaps this discussion also delayed the time. The two girls were both very rude in their responses and attitude. They told us we could try to ask to pass without the boarding pass, knowing that they would not let my father pass as we tried and they sent us back. Back at the front desk, the two girls from customer service, which were always very rude to us, made us pay about 200 dollars more for another flight that kept us at the Airport for 3 more hours, plus it was directed to LAX and not to Burbank. With the new boarding pass I asked my father to try skip the line and go to the gate to see if he could try to speak to the manager and see if he could still catch his flight to Burbank. My dad arrived at the gate at 3.15 pm, handed me the phone so I could speak to the staff, explained the situation but I was told to wait for them to ask. My father has been waiting for a while, but no one came to say anything. He realized he lost the flight when he saw they were shutting the door. This company is the worst of all. This is how they treat customers that cannot speak English, have health problems and travel with kids.",-1

2022-07-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Dallas Fort-Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2.0,our seats should not be coming off in our hand,True," The flight was delayed twice from 11.30 departure time to 12.45 am with no reason given. The young lady in front of me, as soon as she came to sit on her seat, her whole seat came out in her hand. She picked it to show the flight attendant and he simply told her “all the seats come out like that and she should not worry and just sit”. All my years in flying I know for a fact our seats should not be coming off in our hands, and this flight attendant instead of offering to move her to another seat so she can be comfortable, just blatantly lied and put her there. Isn’t this a safety issue? This young lady was a young girl, maybe just 18 and she just kept quiet and sat. That whole incident really left me upset. Secondly your seats on your flights are the most uncomfortable. Any plans to make your seats at least a bit more comfy? Even Frontier which is a budget airline has comfy seats. Thank you!",-1

I arrived at my airport super early, about three hours before because I always like to be early when I am going to travel in case there is any inconvenience along the way. The situation is that I had already been waiting for about 4 more hours apart from the 3 that I already had and what they said was simply that the trip was delayed and they did not apologize to the clients for the delayed. There were people in that place waiting for 10 hours and at the end they canceled their flight. Please do not travel by this airline. The worst customer service I have ever experienced was with this airline. I would never travel through this airline even if the give me for free the flight. the solution to my problem was to ask for a refund and buy a flight on jetblue the next day.",-1

Not able to explain the reasons our family during that odd hour at Cleveland. Again today board and deboarding had happened. Authorities do not know when the flight will leave, maybe at 8pm now 9 pm.

It was my first round trip flight (Was coming back home to Texas). I flew frontier the first flight and Spirit the second flight. She asked me if I was visiting DFW or going home, I shared with her my personal life on why I had flown to Atlanta and she was astounded to hear my story and she really took an interest. To be congratulated by her made me feel good the rest of the flight. She was very caring and wonderful at her job! I hope her employer sees her potential and sees this review because she deserves recognition for turning a 2 hour 1st flight for me into an amazing experience by just being courteous!",1

On the return flight, the security lane moved extremely slow and we missed our flight. They next flight is tomorrow and we have to spend a night at the airport.

Had a great experience till I got to Philly. Left my purse on the flight and only realized it after I got past security. Went directly to the spirit desk was given misinformation, came back to the spirit desk. I was told they had it at the gate but it would be ""a few minutes"". Of course, it's busy, it was my bad - no problem. 2.5 hours for someone to bring a purse 200 yards from the gate to a customer - come on. When I started losing my cool after 2 hours, one of the ticketing girls tried to gas light me! Unprofessional, unhelpful, just below standard service at the counter. The flight crew and pilot were amazing. So kudos to them, but I won't fly spirit again because if I need help, they are not capable of caring.",-1

2022-07-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline experience in my life,True,"  The worst airline experience in my life. I’ve heard so many bad things about spirit airlines but today my luck left me and I finally got a chance to experience them myself. First, they didn’t board me and my family members on the plane because, apparently, they sold more tickets that they had seats. We were all checked in and standing in the line waiting to be boarded, when they said that the boarding is complete and they gonna let the plane fly without us and about 6-7 more people, which make a total of I would say 10 people. Again, about 10 people weren’t boarded on the plane. Second, my bag that was dropped off earlier, probably had a good flight to Fort Lauderdale but unfortunately without me. All my belongings, including medications, became so independent that they went on a trip alone. No help with that. Customer service be like : Sorry, we can sell your ticket while you are waiting in the boarding line, but we can’t help you with your bag - that is all you need to know about spirit airlines customer service. You can talk to them only if you want to be yelled at, otherwise don’t even bother wasting your time.",-1

I was checking in Puerto Vallarta and the girl asked me if I have checked in bags and I said no then she asked me for carry on and my wife and have 2 carry on. She asked me for $123 for the carry on and I tried to convince her that no one told me about this even the confirmation email did not say that. I tried to show her the document but she and another guy talked to us rudely. The guy told us our options either to throw out carry on on the trash or stay at the airport or pay. I paid and decided to never try this airlines again. The flight was 3 hours and we cannot drink a cup of water unless we purchase it.",-1
2022-07-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Sacramento,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit airlines again,False,"  I purchased a flight and carry on bag bundle flying from Sacramento CA to Las Vegas NV. When I arrived in SAC I spoke to the ticket counter who allowed me to switch the from a carry on to a checked bag without any additional fees. When I get to LAS airport for my returning flight on 07/21/22, I get to the ticket counter at to switch the carry on to checked bag. The agent says I need to purchase a new check bag fee. She then advises me to take some items out of the checked in bag to avoid an extra over weight bag fee ($50), which I do. I get back to the counter and she advises me that its too late to check my bag in for my flight and that I would need to pay an additional $99.00 and $78.00 for the checked bag to reschedule to the next flight. I agreed. I was then astounded to find that it would of been cheaper for me to buy an entirely new flight with Southwest than it would of been to reschedule the new flight. I go back to the ticket counter and ask for a refund of my fees, the $178.00. The supervisor says that they are unable to process the cancellation at the gate and that I would need to call customer service and gave me the 1-855-728-3555 to call. I call the phone number and fill out the ""call me back"" option at about 5:30 PM. I get a call back at 06:09 PM. I explain the situation of what happened to him. Without saying one word I get placed back in the hold line que where I wait there for 45 mins until a new agent answers. I ask the agent why I was placed back in the que and she stated that she was unable to look up any notes as to why I was placed back on hold and apologized. I explain the situation to her and requested to cancel my fees. She explained that she was unable to cancel the ticket and that I would need to submit a request online. So I had the ticket counter refer me to the help line, only to refer me back to a website. Several hours had passed by this point so there was no point in me trying to cancel the Spirit flight. . This has been not only the worst airline interaction but the worst customer service interaction I've ever encountered regardless of the industry. I will never fly Spirit airlines again.",-1

This flight was filled with children and babies and there was no accommodations.  No zones were called. It was disorderly. Employee just asked everyone to get on board and everyone kept pushing each other during boarding.  Flight was delayed 3 times and then after a 4 hr delay we boarded the plane, sat for 20 minutes and then flight was canceled. What!? Why go through the hassle?  The employees showed no empathy.

Today 7/19/2022 we booked to go to our honeymoon but our flight got delayed because our pilot got delayed in New York so him and the crew needed to rest, ok well I understand that, ""it happens"". Well we had a connection flight that now got missed because of the delay and we got another flight from Orlando to our final destination, just had to wait until the next day and we got promised that Spirit will take care of accommodation. We just needed to talk with their people in Orlando, as soon as we landed. When we got there they told us that they can't do anything about it, we were lied to just to get us out of there. This is our honeymoon trip now we have to get a place to stay, pay for transportation, meals and lost a day at our resort so we basically lost 2 days of our honeymoon. My recommendation is to avoid flying thru Spirit, it is way better to pay more and not get lied to.",-1

2022-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,My flight was delayed five times,True,"  Atrocious. My flight was delayed five times. Original flight departed at 4:15 pm. Granted I got there at 11 am due to my ride circumstances. But I was at the airport for a total of 12 hours, and 6 of those were due to the flight being delayed over and over. Final departure time was 11:12 pm. And they could not give me a tangible reason. I reached out to customer service chat to ask them about it. The first person I got sent me a barely legible message and then transferred me to someone else, and that someone else also did not give me a clear answer. They told me it was due to an “upline security issue” and I have no idea what that is. I asked for clarification and they did not make it any clearer before quickly changing the subject. The flight attendants also told me that if the flight was delayed or cancelled for weather reasons that I would not be getting any hotel voucher. This flight was also coming from a city with which I was unfamiliar, and a very dangerous city at that. I am a single young woman with autism traveling alone, and Spirit Airlines was willing to totally strand me in a dangerous city at 12am with no assistance whatsoever due to circumstances totally out of my control. Staff was unprofessional and seemed largely unconcerned with how irritated all of us were. They ran and hid as soon as the flight was delayed a fifth time. I was literally in tears over the flight being delayed because I was terrified that I would be stranded with no help, and staff did absolutely nothing to see if I was okay or needed any questions answered. I also saw multiple staff on their phones with their earbuds in having conversations that were clearly not work-related. And then the plane. My tray had gum stuck to it and they just gave me some hand wipes which of course did nothing. They told me all the menu items were available and then when I tried to order a hot chocolate they were like “oh we’re out of that.” Staff continued to be short, though I think one of them felt bad because he brought me a free water and didn’t charge me for my snack. And then to top it off, Spirit sent me a $50 flight voucher for the flight delay, which, considering how many times it was delayed and how long I waited at the airport, is almost insulting. And I actually got a message from the customer service chat saying “we hope you’ll fly with us again soon.” Absolutely never. Only flying Southwest from now on.",-1
2022-07-17,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Orlando,3.0,,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,My experience was positive,True,"  My experience was positive, considering things that spirit controls. Flight was 90 min late but there was an accumulated delay due to weather conditions in central and south Florida (other airlines such as AA had similar delays on this route). Check in was quick. Crew was there before plane arrives.  Regarding the seats, this is the first time I sit on regular economy seats, they have similar pad ergonomics compared to Alaska or AA. You just don’t notice it because the back is “naked” (so it gives the perception that it’s a regular plastic chair). This flight had wifi service, which is was not aware. I noticed people complaining about the carry on or luggage fees at the airport. And that’s the fundamental problem with some passengers: they don’t pay attention to the ticket purchase process or they think they can bend the rules. In my case I was traveling to spend the night in Orlando and fly back the next day. So no carry on, didn’t really care about a dedicated seat and my personal item was small. Will fly them again as long as  no connecting flight at destination ands less than <2 hours flight",1

2022-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,a really poor poor experience,True,"  As soon as we arrived to luggage drop off I tried to find assistance, when I did the young woman directed me directly to the bag drop off line since I already signed in electronically. Half of the kiosks on another note were not working. I joined the line a very very aggressive man who I found out later was the supervisor yelled at us saying we didn’t have the right tags physically shoved us to the other line. We visually and heard this same man argue with a woman and her child behind us and he also has a verbal altercation with a single woman in front of us. Our experience worsened when we got to the counter with this incredibly rude woman. I tried talking with her and she wasn’t the least but interested in what we needed or answering our questions about where to go after this. She was giggling and have a conversation with the woman colleague on the side of her. I told her I didn’t need a bag receipt that we needed to catch our flight she said maybe you will make it maybe you will not and continued to giggle. When my wife went to look up an airport map to see where we should go she started screaming My wife to stop videotaping her. She was not doing that and even if she was that is her right. She threatened to call the police, my daughter 5 year old was crying it was the worst experience I have ever had. The only reason I took spirit was the availability of the flight that I terribly regret. I have heard things about the service on spirit but never thought anything could be that horrible ever. Boarding was very chaotic they called zone one for a good 2-3 minutes then 2-3 maybe 1-2 minutes then the test of the gates so therefore massive amount of people pushing pulling tugging at one another and longer wait times to get to your seat because people were boarding all areas of the flight at the same time. I took this flight because of the availability of the other flights, you don’t save money if that’s the reason people fly with spirit, no TVs no water and your seats don’t recline if was a really poor poor experience, really I can’t imagine flying or recommending spirit to anyone. The flight crew was rude as well we didn’t ask for anything but you could hear how they spoke to other passengers and how the overall bellowed on the intercom to sit down",-1

And when I asked her why she is yelling at me she responded that’s just how I talk. She was rude and disrespectful and she tried to rip my pre printer bag tag off my bag as I was explaining to her that I will take stuff out of my suit case to match the weight and she wouldn’t give me my boarding pass as if I was going to run away and go Thru security with a 42 lb bag. The seats on the flight were small and had no padding, they were just terrible and uncomfortable I felt like I was riding a city bus not a plane, there was absolutely no entertainment on an 5+ hour flight which is ridiculous, no charging ports or USB port anywhere in the flight. To even get some water on the flight i had to pay $3.5. The bathrooms are small and not clean. Also The flight was delayed to take off and delayed to land.",-1

At the gate I was charged $89 or I would have to leave my daughters personal belongings behind in ATL. after specifically being told by the staff that I was not going to be charged. I could have paid $24 at check-in for my booking instead I was charged $49 at the gate and feel I was scanned out of the money by the representatives of the airline after contacting that I feel they support the behavior of their Representatives ripping off their clients. I was not the only one this happened to there are at least 10 other people on the same flight that had the exact same issue and I feel it's a scam by the company itself.,-1
2022-07-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Los Angeles,,,,,,,1.0,will never fly with Spirit again,True,"  I was booking my flight on my phone with Spirit and the final total cost quoted to me before I clicked the book button was $316.59. This included my luggage fee, seat fee, government cut and other fees. But right after I clicked the book button, I was taken to the confirmation page where it said I was charged $404.59 total. I immediately called Spirit and they said they would not offer me a refund for the difference and that they couldn't offer a full refund. I emailed the complaint to their help center and they also said there's nothing they can do and that prices vary all the time. You cannot quote someone their total price, and then charge them more after they've clicked to book two seconds later. I'm in disbelief that they are not refunding me the difference of $78 given these circumstances and I'm having to file complaints with the Department of Transportation and the BBB to try and get my money back. Horrible service. I do not trust them and will never fly with Spirit again after this experience.",-1

A flight from Orlando to Miami is an hour. My flight was 1:38, when i checked in around 11:30, i was notified that the flight was delayed until 3. I went to my gate, the plane arrived around 2 and we were told boarding should be around 2:30. By 3, we were still not boarded and were not notified why. Flight was pushed back until 3:40. At this point it’s already been 4 hours at the airport. 3:40 comes around and we are told that we have to go to another gate and that our flight is pushed back to 5:30. They knew something was wrong to delay the flight and instead of trying to move in a timing manner aware that people have been here since 12, they wasted people’s time. a flight that should’ve been a quick 1 hour situation turned into a 6 hour waste of my time. Absolutely never flying with Spirit again.",-1

Spirit will say they can only do vouchers, I want my money back. I have spoken to them about compensation for certain things that was caused due to my delay, and they are trying to say that they can compensate me for my Lyft ride & food from the 9th. Not my hotel that I paid for in advance that I couldn't get a refund & I ended up having to get a rental car on the 10th due to the delay when I originally wasn't supposed to & the flight was still delayed on June10th.

2022-07-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,we never got on the plane,False," Memphis to Orlando. I was very hesitant to fly with Spirit in the first place but I wanted to give them a try. Well, I was so wrong to do so. Once we arrived at Memphis airport I received a email/text that the flight was delayed. Okay no problem our flight was to leave at 5:30PM now 6:54PM. After waiting close to its time to board the plane the supervisor informed us that our flight was CANCELLED! WHAT! The worst part was that the workers including the supervisor was smiling and laughing like this was okay. It was not okay. We drove 4 hours to get to Memphis for them to tell us that our flight was CANCELLED. Then you have the nerve to tell us that we can get a food voucher and hotel voucher. We waited until about 10:30PM and then you stated that there were no more vouchers. That there will be a flight the next day leaving at 12(noon). So we were out of money for a hotel in Memphis (out of our own pocket) only to go back to the airport the next day to leave for the (noon) flight. We waited and the next thing the workers didn't even tell us that the flight leaving at noon was for EMPLOYEES ONLY! You got to be kidding me! You sat there and new this and didn't even say a word. I personally called customer service of Spirit and they stated that there were no other flights leaving until Monday July 4th. Today is July 3rd! And you telling me we will not be on the Noon flight! HOW Unprofessional is that! Then you say there is a 5:30 flight but its already booked for today (July 3rd) So you telling me that you cancelled our flight on July 2nd , you said come back for a Noon flight for EMPLOYEES ONLY then you say the 5:30 flight for that day is booked. I promise you I have never seen nothing like it. I will not ever use this airline again. P.S: We did end up booking a 6:00 PM flight with Southwest on July 3rd and Thank God we had no problems! I always fly Southwest and I always have a pleasant experience. As for Spirit Airline! Their Spirit is not a good one at all! Cant give you the review on the flight itself with Spirit because we never got on the plane!",-1

Poor customer service. My luggage was a day late which tends to happen. What upset me was the customer service I witnessed. I was distraught because I had a wedding the next day for which I was maid of honor and I go to the luggage office and no one was there but the sign said open. About 15 minutes later I see a young lady walk in with coffee and a bagle. As I am telling her my dilemma she seems completely disinterested as she is buttering her bagle- not looking at me once. After I get done telling her my story she says ""well I dont know why they sent your bags here""- which made sense. She proceeds to look up my bag number. She said it was already sent through another airline which I was previously told but was turned away from said airline. I ask her if I could get a print out of my bag information to get it to the other airline. She says no and does not offer an alternative; doesn't even offer to call the other airline. I say thank you for your time and leave. I ended up getting my baggage from the other airline after going back and forth. Then came the return trip. I had two delays in a row, same day. One was an hour delay and the other was a six hour delay. The whole crew seemed nonchalant about the whole thing. Giggling when they made the announcement of the delay. Literally asking the members who were on this same flight to get out of the line for the front desk to ask questions. People missed their connecting flights and time with family. I had planned to see my family for my day in San Diego who I hadn't seen for a year due to being stationed in a completely different continent. They took that whole day from me and said sorry, heres 12 bucks for your troubles. There was never any kind of explanation, no sense of urgency.

I recently decided to give them another try and that was the worst decision ever. Spirit damaged my checked bag and then denied my claim. My suitcase is a hard case suitcase. When I picked up my suitcase from baggage claim there was a huge dent on the side. It’s like they picked up the suitcase and threw it against a rock. A damaged like that doesn’t happen easily. After receiving my damaged bag, I filed a claim a few minutes later. A few days later they denied my claim. I asked them why was my claim denied and can they elaborate. They could not give me a valid reason why my claim was denied. They just wanted to keep money in their pockets. No apology was made for damage to my property. Experiences like this is why I stopped flying with this airline. Please do not fly with Spirit, the flights might seem cheap but you end up losing more.",-1
2022-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orange County to Boston via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Still fighting for correct refund,True,"  My daughter and I were headed home from CA after her college orientation. I'm a single mom on a budget so I decided to try Spirit. I knew about the fees, the late arrivals/departures. I scheduled accordingly. We were about to board the plane in CA I when I checked my email. An email had just come in our flight from L.V. to Bos was canceled. They had no info at the gate about what was going to happen. We had paid for seats which included earlier boarding. So we headed to the line. They began to make 2 lines 1 for passengers going to Bos and the other for all other passengers. They gave no information as to what the purpose was for the 2 lines. I could hear passenger talking about Spirit making arrangements for their connecting flight for Bos before getting on the plane. My daughter was exhausted and just wanted to get on the plane and sit. So I spoke to the agents to verify the purpose of this line. They stared at me and said nothing. They had no intention of rebooking anyone just stopping them from getting on the plane. I asked if they were not allowing the passengers on the plane & not rebooking their flights. I said I paid for the flight and they could not stop me from getting on that plane. So we got on the plane to at least get a portion of our trip home complete. As it turns out there were a few of us on that plane. Upon arrival in L.V. the gate crew knew nothing about the canceled flight. We were told to go to the agents at the check in counter. At first there was just a few of us waiting at an empty counter. The crowd grew and grew before someone finally came out. We were each bounced from one agent to another with no help from any of them. We were all told that the flight was canceled because of an act if God and therefore Spirit was not responsible for rebooking, refunding or giving vouchers. I knew this was not legal. In the US by law they have to refund the money regardless of the reason for the cancellation. I made phone calls, did the chats and spoke to the agents there with no help. I got a text message from Spirit with a rebooked flight. I was thrilled. It was Wed night and we were supposed to arrive in Boston Thurs morn. The rebooked flight was leaving Sat night arriving Sun morn in Ft Lauderdale! They couldn't understand why I didn't want the rebooked flight. If all of this wasn't bad enough, they were rude and mean. I can deal with a lot, but I expect them to at least pretend to care. One supervisor yelled at me stating if I wanted service I should have booked on a more expensive airline. At one point I was standing there waiting for yet another supervisor when a big commanding man came to the agent next to me. He said that they had rebooked him and his family, got them a hotel, and a lyft but he needed a car seat for the ride and she arranged for it that minute. So they could help. They chose not to. After hours of being yelled at & last left I gave up. Time to walk away. I realized they still had her bag. I went back to the counter where 5 supervisors stood talking and laughing. They looked at me & ignored my presence. I calmly said excuse me could I just get her bag. One lady turned to me and started yelling at me that they told us to go get our bags & pointed. We headed that way and ran into a man who was in line with us & stopped to chat. A supervisor came running at us screaming to go get the bags or else we wouldn't get it. Still fighting for correct refund.",-1

We had already paid for the carry on and I asked will I get a refund for my carry on. They said it would automatically update on the kiosk. Once it printed it showed it had not updated and simply charged me for a full checked back $79. I went to customer service to voice my complaint and no one was there at 6:00 P.M. at the gate. Then called since it was the only available option and they said the best they could do for me was give me a credit which I did not want I didn't make the mistake the woman lied and said it would automatically update and never did. This airline is a disgrace to all people and companies that work in customer service and travel.,-1

Made me pay $89 to “consolidate” my little purse because she will get “trouble from other people”. Never have I had problems flying with my carry on bag/bags. All are always within size and weight limits. On top of that, the gate staff was rude to my mom. Absolutely horrible customer service. I don’t care who you are or what your job protocol is, it costs zero dollars to be a nice person. This airline and its employees are a joke. Never flying this airline ever again.

Then I was charged $99 each to rebook my tickets for me and my daughter. That flight was delayed 4 time I got 4 separate emails about an hour apart changing the departure time. I finally called the call center to request a refund. I was advised I can’t get a refund only a flight credit. I requested a supervisor. The supervisor hung up in my face I called back again spoke with a different supervisor who also hung up in my face. Im out over $1000. For a flight I couldn’t even catch these people are evil and need to be closed down. I will never fly with them again.,-1
2022-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,negative customer service experience,False,"  I had a flight today that was to take off at 7:50 a.m. from Pittsburgh to Las Vegas for my sister's wedding. This is the first time I have ever used this flight service and was a little nervous to switch. But bought the tickets anyways. I was in line for over an hr and then the gentleman that was working the checked bag counter went into the back room and told me he would be back with me in a minute. 1 minute turned into a half hr and I began asking other flight companies, tsa agents, other patrons and even a security guard about the employee who left the counter and that I needed service and I needed to catch my flight. I'm still in disbelief that the worker just up and left in the middle of checking our bags in. He finally came back and seemed agitated by something and spoke to me sarcastically and then even giggled when he said Im not going to make my flight and then proceeded to tell me that I he can give me another flight later this evening for $99. I said you just told me to hold on one moment and then disappeared for over a half hr and you want me to pay more money for a different flight? This is ridiculous. I have never had such a negative customer service experience in my life. In the end I never ended up getting another flight or a refund.",-1

I had my son sitting on my lap before take-off. The flight attendants noticed this and went and got someone and brought him to sit in my sons seat that I paid extra for! I had every intention of sitting my son in the other seat but I literally had to hold him uncomfortably on my lap the entire flight. It’s not my fault that this airline overbooked the flight and I suffered because of it. They had no right to sit someone in that seat that I paid for, against my wishes. The airline then refuses to refund me for this extra seat I paid for that someone else sat in. They forced me against my will to hold my 35lb child the entire flight. Completely unethical and greedy. Terrible airline. I’m a single mom struggling to make ends meet. I hope the airline is happy they ripped off a struggling mom and her 2 year old.",-1

The Spirit Employee was so darn nasty to passengers until she called security to stand next to her but she was the aggressor. I flew in on Delta which was beautiful, flew back on Spirit which was horrible. They charged me $89.00 for a carry on which I didn’t know that I couldn’t carry my bag on or I would have purchased it on-line for $50.00. I didn’t have the $89.00 in my account at the time. I felt panicked which is a terrible feeling all over a bag. Thank goodness my bank let the charge go through, had it not gone though I would have been in a real situation of couldn’t get back in time for work. Never, Never again will I ever fly Spirit. I ended up over paying for a one way ticket. Don’t Fly with Spirit it’s not a cheaper flight just cheaper service.",-1

Manager turned her back on us after we tried to figure out our plane situation since their delayed flight made us miss our next scheduled flight. Boarded an  ""On Time"" flight 70 minutes late. Manager also kept cutting us off while talking saying it not her fault or problem and we need to figure it out for ourselves. Had to pay extra for a seat after buying the tickets for the flight. .

2022-06-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,very chaotic and inadequate,False,"  This was the most ridiculous experience I've had so far with a flight. Zero stars for the ground staff (the people that should help you during boarding). I had a flight for Atlanta to Los Angeles. Was at the airport three hours before departure and at the gate one hour before start boarding. The flight's gate was changed two time which is not a problem (it happens). The flight got a delay, which is also not a problem (it happens). The problem came when the three grand staff women started to board people on the plane. First: they were very chaotic and inadequate! Second: they obviously didn't know what they are doing. Third: they didn't even had the courtesy to explained to us why we( myself and 5 other people) were involuntarily bumped from the flight. They didn't board us. They started calling people zone by zone and said everybody to wait for their zone to be called. I was zone three and the other 5 people were zones three and 4. After they called zone 2, they stopped calling zones and started checking people's tickets one by one on the line and it appeared that they overbooked a lot of tickets. When I went to the desk and asked one of the inadequate boarding women what's going on, she totally ignored me and left the desk. The other 5 people and I tried to ask the other two women and they also split and never came back. Our tickets were rebooked for the next day but we already missed our connections and waste additional time.",-1
2022-06-25,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Sacrament to DetroitI via Las Vegas,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2.0,I will not use this airline again,False,"  I will not use this airline again. I had to pay $71 for carry on bag. $30 to assign my seat. Total of $101 besides the ticket. One more thing. Drink is usually free in these major airlines but Spirit charges $3.50. No thanks. I would just use major airlines which include all of the costs at the beginning. No surprise cost is appreciated, guys. I hope that this review helps other people to choose airlines.

2022-06-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,False,"  I am promising myself today that I will never fly Spirit again. They essentially steal peoples money because they do not have enough people who want to work for such a garbage agency that they can't fly any of their planes. They say that the ""weather"" is the reason why they cancel the flight in order to not give you a refund for the expenses you have incurred. Even my ride to the airport was $50 just to have to spend additional money on a train in order to get to my destination. I have such hatred for liars and cheaters and Spirit Airlines is at the top of that list right now. It has not been more than a slight drizzle at my destination and cleared up very quickly. They were saying hail and tornados. I'll never in my life even consider Spirit and their horrible morals ever again and I hope anybody reading this review does the same.",-1
2022-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Salt Lake City,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience we have ever had,False,  I purchased a ticket for my daughter to fly from LAX to SLC. When I checked her in I paid the $41 bag fee but when she arrived at the airport to check in she was charged an additional $75 because her bag was overweight. So I spent a total of $116 for a single bag to fly it would’ve been cheaper to charge me for two bags. In total it cost me twice as much to fly one bag as it did my daughter. For a airline to be a budget airline this is by far the worst experience we have ever had. Not only is this not a budget airline they treated my daughter terribly at the check-in counter. This company uses horrendous tactics to to inflate the price so you are no longer paying a budget price and you will have no choice but to pay their horrendous fees. In no way would I ever recommend flying with this airline if I could give them zero stars I would. Save yourself the hassle and your dignity by not dealing with this airline company pay a few extra dollars for a reputable airline as this company is not reputable and uses harsh tactics to get money from you.,-1

The kiosk for check wasn’t working so they told me to check in at the counter. Bag fee for this was $300 For 4 bags. They then destroyed 2 of the bags which I bought for approx $150 each. After 3 months of trying to get help from them they refused too credit the outrageous baggage fee or replace my bags citing various policies. I look forward to never using them again. They know how to not delight customers",-1

What I am upset about was when leaving New Orleans I arrived 1 hour early as did many other passengers. Take off was delayed 40 minutes because 39 passengers were late so we waited for passengers who don't know how to show up on time and run late so us, the passengers who show up on time, are left to wait and be late now. If spirit airlines wants to reward bad behavior then I would prefer riding on a airline that is more professional and responsible. If you show up late to your own flight and miss your flight that should be your problem not the 100+ passengers who have been waiting and showed up on time. There was no issue with the flight. We simply waited nearly an hour for 5 more of the 39 passengers who were late. I wish I could deliberately show up to my next flight 30 minutes late, expecting my flight to wait just for me.",-1

My original direct flight got a layover added in. Instead of landing in Denver at 3 like I was supposed to I got in at 10 pm. On top of all of that, I had to pay $90 for a carry-on bag that should be for free.

The mobile app did not work for me, was troublesome from the very beginning. I did not realize that my checked bag to Las Vegas was not accounted for, so we had to pay the excessive fee at the airport. I asked for a refund for the difference of the fee (not the entire fee) since I tried to add the checked bag on the app prior to my flight, I was told ""If we did that for you, we would have to do that for everyone"". If your app doesn't work, shouldn't you do that for everyone? I'm in total shock at their poor customer service. You would think they would like to retain customers with everything going on but they lost this one and anyone that asks me for a recommendation.",-1
2022-06-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Chicago O'Hare,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines customer review,True," When boarding my flight, I was trying to put one of my bags on top of my seat, I heard someone yelling from the middle of the plane but I didn't think it was for me, I continue trying to fit my bag when a very rude flight attendant came to me and said, hey! I'm talking to you! We are saving those for bigger items, put it underneath the seat in front of you, I had two more bags with me so I tried to do it but it didn't fit, so I put it in the cabinet on top of my seat. The flight was full and the spots were filling up very quickly a couple of passengers put their bags next to mine with no problems until the bin was full. Suddenly the same crew member who was wearing an apron came back with a bigger bag and told us see, I told you these bins are for bigger items grabbing my bag and giving back to my wife while yelling I told you this has to go underneath your seat, I tried to explain to her that it didn't fit and she shushed me, totally unprofessional and very rude, I told her don't shush me and she said well don't talk back to me. My wife told her if that's the case I'm going to carry it here with me and she said that we were putting in danger the passenger that was sitting next to us. I told her well that is why I was putting it on top and she goes well there is no room, I said there was room when I board the plane. Then she said you know what if you are not going to cooperate whatever and she starting walking to the front of the plane. She grabbed some papers and start looking for who knows what. She came back and said again this bag has to be underneath the seat, because the top is reserved for people that paid for it like the one she put instead of mine. I told her well guess what I paid $11.00 to be a priority boarding to find a place right on top of my seat like Spirit advertise when they charge you the fee. When I told them that during the boarding of the plane they looked at me like if I was just coming up with it and they didn't know what I was talking about, so don't fall for it you are giving them free money. The staff member said again whatever are you going to do it or not? I said I have to otherwise you will kick me out of the plane, I've seen plenty of videos where an empowered flight attendant kicks customers out of a plane for no reason. After that she decides to open a bin in the next seat and guess what she finds that it could carry more bags and puts mine in there looks at us and says happy? and shakes her head as if me and my wife were the most disgusting people on earth. Yelling at me, shushing me, discriminating me because according to her I didn't pay for my bag to be on top of my seat was ok, and further more she went upfront and started whispering to the other 2 members of the crew and then they both looked at us shaking their heads and giving us dirty looks. Then thank goodness they ignored us for the rest of the flight and to top it off, when I was leaving the plane, one of the other crew members looks at me with a very sarcastic smile in her face and said I hope you enjoyed your flight see you soon. So if you want to be discriminated, yelled at, disrespected and treated with sarcasm and unprofessionalism Spirit is the way to go!",-1

2022-06-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,we will never use this airline again,True,"  Our flight from New Orleans (Flight 618) to Orlando on June 16, 7pm was cancelled without any warning. We only found out about this cancellation when we arrived at MSY airport. There was no prior communication whatsoever from Spirit about this. We were eventually booked on another flight leaving New Orleans the following day( June 17) at 7.40pm (i.e after 24 hours). This left us out of pocket as we had to spend more on booking a hotel (including meals) for another night. I contacted Spirit Airlines customer services department and was told that there was nothing that the company could do regarding the reimbursement of extra costs incurred. We are aware that due to unforeseen circumstances, cancellation can occur but we expected, at least an apology but none was provided. I found this this to be astonishing to say the least. The airline could have offered us some credit/vouchers of some sort that could be redeemed for some future flights. Needless to say, we will never use this airline again - lesson learnt!",-1

They said the bags are free and “carry on” only comprises wheeled bags. However, upon boarding, they stopped us and charged us $84 per bag. Note that each bag was less than 5 kgs.

We are told we will need to call an 800 number to get any type of refund. What A disaster this airline is in every respect. Call customer service and ask to speak with management, no help! Long lines of dissatisfied customers with no management help whatsoever. Their customer service is non-existent. To offer a paying customer an alternative of flying out 2 days late for my daughters wedding is unacceptable. This airline should not exist and needs a whole new attitude when it comes to customer service and support. Very disappointing!",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Nashville via Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,failed me miserably,True,"  The true test of customer service does not come during the day to day operation when things go well. It comes when things do not go as planned. In this regard Spirit Airlines dropped the ball and failed me miserably. My June 10th travels from Salt Lake City Utah to Nashville Tennessee went wrong with an air traffic control delay of a little more than an hour in my connecting city of Orlando Florida. The Salt Lake City flight touched down in Orlando at 1:25 PM. The airline chose to let the Nashville Flight take off at its on time scheduled 1:40 PM departure. I literally walked into the terminal while that flight was still on the ground. A delay of the Nashville flight of just 20 minutes would have meant that I, and about 20 other travelers would have made our connecting flight. I have seen other airlines hold another flight at the gate so connections can be made. Spirit decided that this was not important enough for us. There was no other flights leaving for Nashville that day on Spirit Airlines. I can understand that sometimes command decisions have to be made with other circumstances to take into consideration. I even might have been able to accept the decision to let the Nashville flight leave on time if Spirit airline had taken an active roll in aiding those of us stranded in Orlando; however, Spirit Airline did absolutely nothing for us. I inquired at the gate about what I should do and was told to inquire at an information desk that was about two gates away. A large group of us went to the information desk and stood to wait for help. Two employees were behind the desk. Just after we approached, one employee took his jacket and left. The other was there a few more minutes as a document was printing. She then took her documents and left. We stood for about 20 minutes waiting for another employee to arrive. No one ever came. Another employee walking by then informed the group that we needed to proceed to the ticketing counter. As a group we went to another terminal and went to the ticketing counter to be told that we had been book onto flights for the following day. We were told that our only options were take the flight the next day or take a refund for that part of the trip. That was the extent of the aid we received from Spirit Airline. No help in finding accommodations. No help in finding another airline with a flight. Not even so much as a “let me upgrade your seat.” Customer service is about showing those in difficult circumstances that you value them. Spirit Airline showed me that all they value is my money and I will ensure Spirit Airline never gets another dime of that. I will never recommend Spirit Airline to anyone and will never again use them for my travel.",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cali to Newark via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The absolute worse service,True,"  The absolute worse service! Currently at airport as I wait online with 2 family members. Spirit decides to keep us inside a turned off airplane, no air circulating, no notice but that the airport is not ready to take us in. Not considering connecting flights and having to do immigration, this was an international flight. Gets better before even getting through immigration we were forced to collect our luggage! We have connecting flights! On top of having to take our luggage, they are damaged. Than they take you only in small groups because the line to immigration is overwhelming and they can’t fit enough people leaving our connecting flight with less than hour.  Incompetent, unprofessional staff goes on to tell us the next flight they can put us in will be tomorrow at the same time, so 24 hours we have to wait in an airport because they will not accommodate a hotel because it wasn’t Spirit’s fault it was the airport and immigration.",-1

When I got there an agent pointed me to the correct direction to purchase, she told me to hurry as they were closing in 3 minutes at 6.30 pm. I ran to the correct line and was told that I couldn't book my flight because she was closed even though it was 6.27, and only had one person in line. I was furious! I went back to the first line to speak with a manager. The first employee I spoke with said a manager wouldn't be able to do anything but I insisted so she led me to the line to see a manager. When I got to the front of the line an employee asked me what was wrong. I told her I wanted to see a manager, she explained that I could explain the situation to her, if she could she would help me, if not she would get a manager. I explained that I had driven almost an hour to get there, gas is $5.19 dollars a gallon and I was given conflicting information about booking a ticket. I apologized for my lack lustre attitude then explained again what the problem was. The staff member was compassionate to my situation and obviously had the spirit of Spirit Airlines. I was able to book my family's flights and leave very satisfied.",1
2022-06-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never ever book another flight with Spirit again,False,"  I book a flight from Memphis to Orlando, it was a quick weekend trip to go to a wedding, I booked it two months in advance. I thought I would try this small airline because it was a straight flight. The flight was to leave Memphis at 5.25 pm. At 9.30 am I went online and got my boarding pass, but at 9.45 they canceled the flight. I called the airline and was asked what language? So I said English, but the guy had such bad broken English, that I had to ask him to repeat himself 2 to 3 times for everything he said. They wanted to book me for 4 days later which was 2 days after the wedding, I asked to be booked on another airline, but after trying about 6 times to understand him, I asked him to just give me back my money, he refunded my ticket, while he was doing it I asked why the flight was canceled. For the first time he spoke clearly and said do to weather. Although 3 hrs before the flight and past the time the flight would leave, it was 75 degrees and sunny in Memphis and it was 80 and sunny in Orlando, and clear all the way in between! I will never ever book another flight with Spirit again.",-1

I was advised they would give me credit for 90 days advised would not be flying within. That time frame. I was told best they could do. This airline is a scam, so I can't use my flight so they feel they are entitled to full fee. When it states on there site there is 100 dollar charge if canceled less than 24hrs of flight.",-1

Getting him on the flight was a stress. I recommend never flying with Spirit Airlines. Their original flight was booked for 5am Saturday departure. The flight was canceled due to weather. The airline wanted to charge our youth $350 to reschedule. After 2 hours on the phone we talked them down to $75, and scheduled for a new flight on Sunday. This all happened before the original flight was scheduled to depart. Spirits customer services sent him a email with new flight details, and confirming charges, but never actually logged the flight it to their main software. So he was never added to the flight. So on Sunday we drove up to the airport to straighten out in person. He has all information documented in E-mail. The lady explained in the system he was marked as a no show for the original flight (which was canceled documented in email.) So she worked some magic and got him a ticket for Monday. We get home from the airport. He gets a call from Spirit canceling the flight we just booked because he was a no show on the original flight. So three hours later on the phone. This finally got straighten out, and not sleeping last night in fear this is going to happen again. Life lesson, fly Delta.",-1

I have nothing bad to say about Spirit. I was a little hesitant on flying them because of everything bad that I’ve heard, but it was a good experience. We departed Boston about 10 minutes late but still arrived in Florida 30 minutes earlier than planned! Flight attendants were really nice and friendly, they served snacks and drinks right after we reached our cruising altitude. You had to pay for it though, but I decided to buy my own snacks and drinks at the airport before takeoff. Only 2 complaint were that it was a hard landing, and the wifi wouldn’t give me an option to connect. I would definitely recommend Spirit to anyone looking to fly on a budget!",1

Spirit is the most incompetent airline you can fathom. They sent my bag to the wrong airport, and have been unable to find it and return it.

Then only two of my three bags arrived at the destination. Essentially impossible to log the file ID online as their system does not work, and impossible to get a hold of the company by phone. Had to spend 18 hours (!) on the phone to speak with someone, to find out that the bag had been delivered at the airport but would not be delivered on time to me before my departure from Boston. At the end, I had to go back to the airport to pick it up myself and was not offered any compensation for the delay. Extremely disrespectful. Will make sure to never travel with Spirit again.

I am currently beyond upset with my experience with Spirit Airlines. $200 for a checked bag. $60 for a carry on item. My flight from LAS to DTW was delayed by an hour. Then after everyone has boarded we were told we had to wait another 15 minutes to leave due to them missing paperwork. After that 15 minutes was up they then tell us again that we have to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes till we leave. Very poor service. Would never recommend this airline to anyone, even if it’s cheaper.

2022-06-07,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Nashville to Las Vegas,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,2.0,told luggage could be delivered to my hotel,True,"  A full flight flew into LAS on 6/6/22 and all the passenger’s luggage was on the aircraft with us. After waiting 45 minutes for luggage, we were informed that it would take an additional 1.5 hours to get our luggage due to staffing shortage. Now I recognize that this is a problem everywhere. So we are told that we could wait (the math 3.25 hrs total) or come back with no accommodations being made for the additional Uber/Lyft fares to do so. Since this was a business trip and I had to be somewhere in an hour, I asked and was told that the luggage could be delivered to my hotel once I called back to confirm that the baggage was in the claim area. An hour and a half later, I call back and of course the luggage was there! I request delivery for my luggage providing all the pertinent info. Five hours later (midnight), still no luggage, the office has closed, and no call to say that it would not be delivered today as indicated. Again, I’m told but the desk agent that is now manning the phones that I can come get it. So I ask if an round trip Uber/Lyft to be provided and I’m told that is not an option. Spirit’s problem that they want me to fix. I guess I’ll update what happens next once the office reopens at 3:15 a.m., since I have an 8 a.m. meeting and need my suitcase. Won’t be too surprised if the response is “You can come get it.”",-1

I showed up at my connecting flight at 0704 when my flight had a departure time of 0715. The agent told me they had a 15 minute policy of closing the doors 15 minutes prior to departure. She wouldn't let me on board. I had to rebook for a flight arriving the next day because of this. Since I was stuck at the airport all day, I made some observations and saw that there were plenty of flights which kept their doors open just minutes before departure time. What a malicious act on the part of the agent. Explicitly poor customer service. My plane was still at the door and she was still at the counter. She could have easily let me on board just like the other agents I observed. Just livid about wasting 24 hours at the airport and a work day. Needless to say I will not be using Spirit again.",-1

It got delayed until 1:00 pm on 5/24/22. They would not outright cancel the flight and everyone needed to make overnight arrangements or other flight arrangements themselves. They said it would be paid for but everyone had to pay out of pocket. They just gave everyone a QR code to their help site. There was very little communication. I did feel bad the gate agent was harassed by other passengers as it was not his fault and he could only relay information. This was unacceptable.,-1

I lost my connecting flight and had to rebook. They had just one person trying to rebook flights for dozens of people. I stayed 2 hours in the line and when I finally was able to talk to to someone, he said that I had to wait 2 days for a flight. I asked for accommodations, a hotel and a meal and they said it’s not their fault I missed my connecting flight. They said I would be received a refund but they didn’t process it there, I have to call customer service. As a result I had to find another flight with a different airline and ended paying $680 for a one way ticket. Worst experience ever - this was my last time using spirit!",-1

Personal item was charged even though it was the dimensions of 18x14x8. The charged me $84 for a small bag that I measure with a ruler before I brought it to the airport. Their boxes are shaped smaller so your bag wont fit in there on purpose, so that way they can charge you for a bag that should fit, which is absolute fraud. Poor disability aid as well. They saw I had a cane but didn't bother to help me put my bag in the overhead bin even though I could have fitted it in my seat. Was also completely ignored on the flight. Boarded last even though I have mobility issues. Didn't ask if I needed or wanted anything during the flight and was just completely ignored. Will NEVER fly with Spirit again. Ruined my trip completely. I'm sure they will charge me for my correctly sized personal item once again. Always bring the smallest bag you have because if you have a small purse they will charge your bag. No one should have to cry on their flight they should be excited to go somewhere and get the help they deserve. You wont get that at this airline. Delta and American Airlines are so much better don't waste your time being miserable spending high and hidden fees for bs you shouldn't of been charged for in the first place. Oh the best part is you'll get absolutely no refund for anything. They only care about stealing money from you especially when you're vulnerable, like myself.",-1

I read all the reviews about this airline but decided the saving justified it and I could put up with them for the two and a half hour flight.

None of the links in their email worked and I'm going for a full refund using card chargeback if necessary as I'll never book with them again.,-1

This airline is seriously the worst. My flight was seven times before eventually being canceled. During the waiting time non of the staff cared of providing at least water plus I'm pretty sure if I eventually got on the plane, they would charge for water and everything else. I don't know if the reason of weather conditions is valid, because I did see the rain stop and the sky looked pretty clear. Anyways I did not feel any care from the customer service. I got the message from my sister saying that Spirit pilots are protesting because they are not getting paid so maybe that was the real reason! I would say time is money and please understand that time is precious. The cheap tickets from Spirit Airlines are not worth it. I came home feeling so disappointed, hungry, sleepy and all that ""jazz"".",-1

When we arrived at the airport at 2am to have no one give us a real explanation as to why this happened; we lost a lot of time and money on our hotel and car rental. Fast forward to TSA we passed with our personal bag just to be charged an obscene amount of money for a personal bag.,-1

This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. The staff is rude, they delayed the flight 6 times and had to wait for 8 hours until they finally cancel the flight. They didn’t care about passengers and never gave a straight update regarding the flight. Everything about this airline (if you can even call it that) needs to be review by a regulatory agency.",-1

Reason given was weather conditions at Orlando airport but my friend picking me up lives next to Orlando airport and said they had only a light drizzle of rain for a couple hours then stopped.

2022-05-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Milwaukee,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Turned into an absolute nightmare,False,"  We wanted to travel to Vegas to get married and enjoy some nice weather and a nice vacation. What was an awesome week of fun and family fun with a wedding. Turned into an absolute nightmare and costs lots of extra money and made us think we were never going to get home. We were also traveling with a 3 year old. I wish I would have read the reviews from Consumer Affairs about Spirit as I would have paid ten times what we did in order to not have to deal with this scam of a company. Our original flight home was supposed to leave early Saturday morning 5/20 and of course we got to the airport extra early so we weren’t rushed. Needless to say our flight was delayed multiple times until we we were finally able to board almost 4 hours later. Well after loading the plane and waiting for what seemed like hours we were told to deboard due to AC issues. They thought they could fix it. So we waited around again only for the flight to be cancelled . At this point we had been at the airport for well over 7 hours and no way to get home anytime soon. We were were told there were no more spirit planes going out to Milwaukee until Monday. They said we would get meal vouchers and hotel vouchers until we could get a flight out. Well. Needless to say we never got any emails for either and by the time we got up to the counter they were out of hotel vouchers. Not once during this Afternoon did we get an apology from anyone. Just attitude. My wife was able to get us booked on another flight for Monday morning again in spirit. I should have known better. Not only were we now stuck in Vegas till Monday we had no place to stay and no rental car to get anywhere. We somehow found a room at the Luxor with our friends but it was over $500 for 2 nights due to EDC festival. We ended up having to place a Walmart delivery order as were running out of stuff for our toddler. Another early morning came and we were at the airport early again for a 9:20 flight. Surely we would not get cancelled again? Well if I was betting man I should have put 1,000,000 on us not getting home for almost another day, after several other delays and boarding and deboarding our flight was cancelled again. It was again due to mechanical issues as well as staff this time as the attendants timed out. And guess what no spirit flights until Thursday. Well I was smart this time and called my dad and had him book us southwest so we could get home. The one caveat was that we would get home at 1am Milwaukee time. So we basically spent another full day at the airport. And the kicker was while we’re were waiting for this spirit flight to be cancelled I had a spirit employee threaten to fight me and “take me out” because I asked if could get my stroller for my son. Who at this point was beyond tired and cranky. And still no apology from spirit. We did talk with a manager who was useless and basically said we could go online and submit everything for reimbursement. Again no apology from her and terrible attitude. We did make it home finally. Very tired and beyond annoyed and upset at this point. My wife had to call in for 2 days of work and I took off one day.",-1
2022-05-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never again,False,"  Orlando to Las Vegas. I am tired of calling and getting different answers regarding a mistake Spirit Airlines made that I ultimately had to pay for, literally. On May 14 I flew from Orlando, FL to Detroit MI, for a flight that was supposed to connect in Detroit to take us to Las Vegas, NV. Our plane arrived late & we were delayed for an hour & change more once we'd boarded the plane. Because of this I missed my connecting flight from Detroit, MI to Las Vegas, NV. The flight attendant came over the speaker & advised that all 19 of us who were supposed to be on that connecting flight would be rebooked for a 9:00 AM flight out of Detroit into Las Vegas. When we got off the flight I asked the guest service agent to confirm this was the case & they said they didn't know & to call customer service to confirm. We waited over 45 minutes to get our bags, so I figured I'd call to make sure I was all set before now spending more money to find a hotel in the area. I literally spent 3 hours calling Spirit's ""customer service"" if you even want to call it that. In this time, I called at least 6 different times & was placed on indefinite holds, hung up on twice, & advised that I could not be rebooked. By this point I was furious & exhausted from the travel day & still looking for somewhere to sleep for what ended up being two hours. I called one last time & immediately requested a supervisor & who finally explained that I was marked as a ""no show"" for the flight from Orlando to Detroit, which is why I couldn't be booked. This is impossible, because I literally waited in the line & then weighed & checked my bag in. The supervisor also advised that there wasn't a 9 AM flight out of Detroit to Las Vegas, but there was a 10:03 AM flight the following morning. I explained to her that I needed to be on that flight & that there was ONE seat left. I was traveling to Las Vegas for a concert that I had already spent a lot of money to attend, thus I could not afford to miss. She explained that she would need to have this ""no show"" tag removed before she could rebook me & I asked how long this would take, as there was one seat left. She advised that she can't give a set timeframe, as it varies so we agreed that the next best thing would be fore me to rebook the flight with her over the phone with her, to ensure I was on the flight. She also confirmed several times that I would be able to get a REFUND on this new flight I had to purchase for $342 once the tag was removed. I did want to spend this extra money because of their mistake, but I also couldn't afford to miss out on the show. The supervisor I spoke with reassured me several times on the call that she would be able to call me back once the tag was removed, read a script to me, & refund my new flight of $342. She called me the following morning, on the 14th, around 9 AM I believe & read me the script & I felt much better. Now, two weeks later I've never gotten an email or any kind of follow up from Spirit Airlines regarding my refund, so I call in & I'm advised that there was a refund of $112 to the original method of payment. I had already explained to the supervisor who booked my new flight that I did not have that old debit card any more & I still have yet to be contacted or refunded. Never again.",-1
2022-05-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Baltimore,,,,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly them again,True,"  I regularly fly to Atlanta from DCA on a variety of airlines, but never Spirit because the extra costs and drive evaporates savings. This time was different because my sister was graduating from high school and Memorial Day weekend made flight $350. Normally they are $150-$250. From the time I originally booked a flight ($84 round trip) weeks ago to the day I was in a bad car accident which left me in pain and having a concussion. Given that I could still not miss the event I added seats and checked luggage to ensure I was comfortable despite the discount flight. I spent $50 for a big front seat and $80 in luggage each way and $15 for a seat going to Atlanta. Day of the flight I get to the airport and check in try to drop my bag. The line made me 2-3 minutes after the cut off. Turns out they delayed the flight so there should not have been an issue. They did the same thing repeatedly to people in line. I was one of 10-15 people that were kicked off their flight because they didn’t want to take my bag I asked if I could check it at the gate given my bag was just a carry on. They told me no. I asked could it just get it as a carry on. They said no. I talked to a rude supervisor that gave me corporates number. I talked to them. They told me there is nothing they can do except have me pay $99 lose the money spent on seats and luggage and get on a flight days later with a 5+ hour layover making it an 8hour trip. It takes 8 hours to drive to ATL so absolutely not. I told them I will book my incoming flight with a different airline if that’s my only option the guy said cool. At no point did he inform me they would cancel my return flight. Days later when I tried checking in my flight was gone. No notifications no nothing. Agents said that’s standard procedure without notification. I called them multiple times had to talk to multiple agents and supervisors to finally get my flight reinstated they did so but my front row seat was gone. I negotiated a different seat. Now the agent must hand me a boarding pass at the gate. Praying I can get on the flight home. The original flight was $84 round trip now the total flight was $220 (add-ones) one-way. I had to spend $200 on SW to fly me to ATL. Overall I wasted over $200 flying with Spirit. They refuse to let you board flight 50+ minutes before take off. I will never fly them again. The cheap price is a trick because you may never be able to board the plane.",-1

My first flight was delayed through Spirit so I missed my connecting flight with Spirit by a couple minutes. They didn’t tell the flight to wait. The manager was rude at the ticketing desk, I just wanted see if Spirit could redirect my flight to get one the same night and she refused, she said I either had to take the refund or get on the flight the next day at 9pm. Horrible customer service she kept walking away and didn’t even help with a refund. Called customer service and said my flight direction could have been changed and helped with a refund. So could have made a flight that was an hour later but instead the manager at LAS airport wouldn’t help me.",-1

They cancel flights left and right with only hours before the flight. They leave you on the tarmac for hours promising you’ll get off soon. The flight attendants are rude and unprofessional, the bags are expensive, they don’t give you snacks or drinks. There’s no security in booking with them. If you want to constantly be worried about them cancelling your flight or delaying it, go ahead. Not worth the money you save.",-1

I am flying from Philadelphia and she flew out of Atlanta. We were meeting up in Ft. Lauderdale We both have our beautiful puppies. My flight took off first and when I landed she called me crying saying ATL wouldn’t let her get on the plane with her pup even though we paid the $125. Per dog. She was still in ATL and they were sending her to Miami because dog can fly international out of Miami but not FLL. (This was not true). Everyone at FLL airport showed no mercy or care except one special, lovely lady, Shaunte, She went out of her way to make sure I was ok and spent the day with my daughter. She was patient and caring. It is so rare in 2022 that people show any kind of emotion. I absolutely wouldn’t of made it through the day without her. She got us a room and booked us on the next flight out.",1

Spirit cancelled the flight and booked a next day flight from OAK to BWI via LAX with a 6 hours layover which is unacceptable. And we arrived at BWI Spirit used one carousel to accommodate flights from Atlanta, LAX , Ft Laudable and it was crowded. Over 500 people looking for their baggage. Crazy. Why? To cut cost I think. Spirit is not customer friendly. I will not fly it again.",-1

I gave them a chance because their flight to Nashville was more affordable than other airlines. The cost of luggage is really high, over $50 for a carry on bag one way. They also changed my flight times multiple times before departure. The last day I was in Nashville I checked in for my return flight the night before. When I woke up I had an email notification from them saying they cancelled my 8 am flight (they sent this out at 2 am). They rescheduled me, not for another flight that day, but for a flight two days later which is completely unacceptable. They also didn’t refund me the cost for the flight yet either. So, I had to scramble and book a $500 flight home with Southwest instead to get home that day. The most unprofessional, terrible airline I’ve ever flown on. I understand paying for drinks or even carry on luggage to keep the tickets lower cost, but to cancel a flight only 3 hours before you’re scheduled to fly? And to not even reschedule the same day, absolutely disgusting. In the end having to pay the luggage costs and for another flight, they were actually more expensive than just going on a better airline!",-1

Our flight was originally scheduled at 9:55p.m. To 11:53. The flight was delayed once again. It’s now 12:54am and we are still waiting they didn’t even accommodate us with a bottle of water!

I booked 4 seats on 1/25/22 for $1,262 with their bundle (not really a low cost, that’s OK for a direct connection) and for a trip scheduled on 5/13-18/22. They then changed the flights 3 times including the day of return on 5/18 to 5/19. When I asked to change my itinerary to get back on my original schedule, I was told that that flight on 5/18 was cancelled and so I had to pick up Chicago instead of Milwaukee, which I have accepted. The fees for editing my itinerary were $752 for the 4 seats (60% of original price, plus cost of rental car). Back home, I contacted their customer service but got no resolution except an offer for 2 vouchers of $50 that I have declined. I do not recommend SA. While I understand that changing itinerary may imply fees, I would also expect that when the carrier is responsible for that change, they would waive those fees, call it courtesy or simply respect of your customers.",-1

Needless to say I will never travel with Spirit airlines again. I got to the airport two hours early for my flight. My flight was then delayed an hour or so. We finally arrive to Atlanta a hour late and only to have to wait an hour and 30 minutes for our luggage due to shortage in workers. Finally after getting to my destination 2.5 hours later to see my gifts were stolen and my luggage was ransacked. I proceeded to call spirit for hour a hour getting the run Around then driving 45 minutes back to the airport. Finally for a worker to tell me go online that’s all you can do .

They canceled our flight 30min before the flight took off, refused to give us our money back, and said that our only option was to be rebooked on another flight with a 9hr layover in 2 days. This was all while we were stuck in Chicago as well so we didn’t even have any place to stay. We ended up paying for a last minute American Airlines flight to get us home later that day, but it was quite expensive since it was same day. Thank you American for getting my family home and I will not be flying Spirit in the future.",-1

2022-05-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Los Angeles,,,,,,1.0,1.0,It's not worth the savings at all,False,"  My first and last time with this airline. They don't care about their customers and they don't provide any customer service. They loaded us onto the plane (2:30pm), then announced we had to get off because there was no pilot. We all waited for almost 2 hours before they told us the flight was canceled and they wanted to move us to a flight the next day. They offered no vouchers for accommodation nor food for the overnight at the airport. The only way we were going to make it home that day was to buy a ticket with a different airline with our own money. They promised if we emailed customer support we would get reimbursed for the new tickets. It's been over a month now. I've called and emailed. No one is getting back to me. The worst airline ever. They will leave you stranded and holding the bag the first chance they get. Avoid it! It's not worth the savings at all. Ended up costing me $600+ extra.",-1

I saw a number of negative reviews, but realized most of them were from people who just didn't follow the rules. Bag sizes are very clear, just follow the rules! Staff were very friendly, flights were on time, airplane was clean. I wonder how many of the negative reviews are from inexperienced flyers?",1
2022-05-19,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Philadelphia,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,I traveled in a regular seat and that was unbearable,True," So I really love the A320 Neo from an operational point of view. This particular aircraft was only 13 months old, you can barely feel the take off and even though this five hour flight experienced turbulence for most of the time, I’m not sure how but you barely feel it inside this narrow body jet. On my original flight from Philadelphia to Las Vegas I traveled in a regular seat and that was unbearable, this time I upgraded to the Big Front Seat and it was better not much better but just “better”. I still find that older models have a more comfortable Big Front Seat with more leg room than the new configuration. The new planes look and feel great however comfort is an overall issue that I’m not sure Spirit cares much for. I’ve decided that I will only fly Spirit on flights that are 3 hours or less, their product on board is not really meant for more than that. At the end of the day Spirit Airlines will take you from point A to point B safely, not on time and with the poorest customer service both in cabin and ground crew in the industry. After all the add-ons I still saved around $200 for this particular trip when compared to a legacy airline, however moving forward like I stated above, I will only fly them if it’s 3 hours or less. And in the words of Forrest Gump - ""That’s all I have to say about that.""",1
2022-05-18,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Orlando,3.0,,5.0,,2.0,4.0,5.0,happily travel Spirit any time,False,"  Financially it was our best option, we had not flown in more than 12 years, so i had no clue what to expect. On arriving at the airport, we were greeted by happy staff. My daughter, who is 8 begins talking to one of the gate people, they make sure the stewardess knows that it's her first flight. They get her a really cute certificate with their and the pilots signatures. All the staff was super welcoming and so friendly and talkative with her. They made sure she was comfortable the whole flight. Our flights ran on time with no issues either way. Bag fees were affordable and they worked with us when we realized we were a couple pounds over the limit. You very much get what you pay for. A seat to get where you're going. I'm 5'5, 230, my husband is 5'10, 330lbs and my son is pushing 6 foot 240lbs, none of us had any issues with seat spacing, you can't recline, but it's an affordable way to your destination. I Will happily travel Spirit any time they are available. Thank you to all the employees we had over our trip. you all made everything fantastic for us.",1

Instead of finding us another flight the same day, because I had my nieces graduation to attend, they send us home and gave us a flight for the following day. And this is not it! Instead of giving us a direct flight to Atlanta which is only an hour and half from Maryland, they gave a flight for FL which is 2 hours and plus a 2 hours stop and from FL to Atlanta another 2 hours, this is crazy. How come you guys sell food on the plane? Isn’t this supposed to be free? Aren't we paying for this on the ticket? Also, the fact that we must pay for our luggage is crazy! The customer service Spirit employees need more training in how to assist people, they should be able to propose different options for their customers when something happens. If the planes aren’t functioning is it our fault? First time flying with them, a very bad experience. Once in the plane, I’ve spoke to one of the hostesses and she told me you guys had a flight available the day our flight got canceled and the day we had to fly back and forth there was another straight flight from Baltimore to Atlanta. Just thinking of this annoys me and makes me mad.",-1
2022-05-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Phoenix,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Definitely won’t do business through them again,True,"  I definitely don’t recommend Spirit Airlines. They have terrible communication and are not trustworthy in my opinion. Back in February my mom, dad and uncle had a flight through them. The flight was early in the morning. We had arrived at the airport with plenty of time. When they went up to the check in when you first walk in they got told their flight was closed. Keep in mind I had pre checked in through their app and the flight status on the app said nothing of it being closed. The only reason they went to the check in desk was for a wheelchair! After being confused and trying to understand what to do next they said that no more baggage could be on the plane. When it was said they had no baggage they were then told they could go. They head upstairs now in a very big rush after wasting lots of time because they were told it was closed by a Spirit employee. Again now keep in mind my Father has ALS and can barely get around as it is so now he can’t breathe rushing around to try and make it. They barely make it there and then were told they couldn’t get on. They and a few others that this happen were told the airline can shut down and close the flight up to 45 mins early due to weather. But, they were there plenty before 45 mins and were told around over an hour before the flight it was closed (I have the texts confirming what time they told them it was closed). On top of that it took my dad a bit longer to get through security due to not being able to empty his own pockets or stand in the machine with your hands up so they had to take him aside and check him with their hands. Again would of had plenty of time if they weren’t told it was closed! After being told they couldn’t get on the flight the rude employee also told them they are lucky they had American Airlines on the way back or they would have canceled the flight back as well. By the way I love flying American and highly recommend them. My parents then drove a long distance again to Green Bay to catch a flight out because they said no flights were available until Sunday and this was a Friday. So they spent over $600 to catch new flights. My mom called Spirit Airlines phone number to see what could be done and was told that whoever she was speaking to couldn’t handle this situation and that she had to submit a form through email and then they would have to investigate everything and get back to her. She did just that and never heard anything. Actually she emailed them numerous times since then and haven’t heard anything back. Definitely won’t do business through them again. I'm curious has anyone else had problems through them like this?",-1
2022-05-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Houston,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is more expensive to fly than it’s competitors,False,  I have flown/picked up people from Spirit on 5 separate occasions. Every single flight has been either delayed or canceled. All from different airports and all at effectively no notice. The additional costs incurred by the delays or cancellations means Spirit is more expensive to fly than it’s competitors. Oh and the seats are terrible too.,-1
2022-05-16,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Las Vegas,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,3.0,took me from point A to point B safely,True,"  I was very happy to fly on a brand new A320 Neo, the plane was only a year old. Takeoff and landing were so smooth and turbulence was barely felt onboard. I have to say it is a magnificent aircraft however this 5 hour flight turned into 7 hours due to a long taxi delay for takeoff and once we landed. For a total of 7 hours seating Spirit should make the padding more comfortable. For this particular plane ticket after all the add-ons I still saved around $200 compared to a legacy airline. The bottom line is do not come expecting much from Spirit and you will not be disappointed. They took me from point A to point B safely and at the end of the day that’s what matters. Will fly back to Philadelphia but this time on a Big Front Seat.",1

This happens in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. It doesn't matter if you miss another flight or go to work no one cares, it's unfortunate that there is no other airline that flies out of Fort Lauderdale.

They do not care or value your time. I can handle a flight being delayed a few hours but to wait for over an hour at baggage claim is ridiculous.

Spirit's customer service is absolutely horrible. Who trains these people? Our flight was ultimately cancelled after having us sit at the gate for at least 5 or 6 hours. They gave us a $7 meal ticket, what is that supposed to do? Because we decided to choose Spirit, we were left with having to lose money, because other things surrounding our trip that was missed could not be refunded. Does Spirit care? Absolutely not! Some of the Agents had attitudes and were nasty with us for wanting answers. Not one time did a Manager come and speak to us about the delay, they literally did not care. That is just not how you treat paying customers. I tried to call their customer service line and was placed on hold twice and ultimately just hung up on.

If you value your time or yourself, do not book with Spirit. They will change your flight drastically without letting you know or giving any accommodations. It's just unfair to not issue an apology or ounce of care when changing someones flight from arriving at 5pm to arriving at 12 am the next day to their destination. I could deal with cheap seating or a small delay but they're just plain horrible with customer service and unexpected significant delays. Worst airline ever.",-1
2022-05-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,avoid them at all costs!,True," Avoid this airline if you are expecting an honest representation of the services and fees this airline provides. What I mean by this is they play on the expectations that travelers have from the industry standard and subtly modify their policies in a veiled attempt charge you extra fees. This way they appear to be a ""budget"" airline option except they make it impossible to for the average traveler to take their flight as advertised, they make it impossible to avoid paying extra fees for literally ""everything"" except the air you breathe, until the cost of your trip turns out to be as much or more than the regular airlines. Example: you pay for carry on and checked bags and have to pay for them ahead of time. Oversized or overweight bags costs more still but you have no way of knowing that what Spirit considers overweight or oversized is different than what you think they would be, i e. the industry standard for overweight is 50 lbs on every other airline I've ever traveled on, so I think I'm good, but for them it's 41 lbs so my 45 lb bag costs another $50 dollars for 4 extra lbs. But since there are fees for everything it's not like I can take out the 4 lbs and put it my other bag to avoid the fee as that would still cost me $50 since the other bag would then be overweight. Its not that they charge extra money for stuff that is standard from other airlines, if they want to be a budget airline and we're up front and clear about their fee structure then no problem. It's their deceptive and dishonest method for charging these fees. Preying on people's misunderstandings of their specific policies as an excuse to reach into their pockets and rob them of more money. This airline doesn't deserve you or anyone's patronage with how they conduct business so avoid them at all costs!",-1

When we get to the airport four hours early. We thought it would be early enough. We waited in line for almost two hours to check-in. The line was long. Extremely long. There were only 4 attendants working. The TSA was very rude. We get to the gate and wait to get on our flight only to have to change our seats because we have two kids under 13 years old he could not sit in the exit seats they put us in.

I was supposed to fly back to LA on May 9. I got to the airport at 7.30 am for my 8.50 flight. First they changed the gate, then at 8.25 am they said the plane was cleaning so it was delayed. However, we got a text later saying the departure time changed to 11.50. People were shocked that they had to clean for 3 hours? Later they said it was because they had technical issues. I had a connection flight that I wouldn’t make on time. Later they helped me reschedule my flight to May 10 at 6.35 am. Flight from Tampa to my layover in Chicago was fine but from Chicago to LA, I was supposed to leave at 10.35 am but it’s 11.05 am and we aren’t even boarding yet.

I have to get it through my head, if Spirit don’t care about their employees, what makes me think they will care about me as a passenger? Three hours delayed! That’s so ridiculous.

Since it was covid I couldn't travel like I usually did then got sick in 2021 where I called them to explain the rep said no problem if you can't travel by the expiration date call us and they will extend your credit.

2022-05-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,They don’t care about the customer,False,  They emailed me last minute saying my flight was changed. I asked to be compensated for my hotel that I booked for the night or get me an early flight with an additional credit for a future flight since it rearranged my schedule and they said no. They don’t care about the customer and the customer service lacks terribly! It’s like they’re reading a script to you like a robot and they can’t say anything else to answer your questions. When asked to schedule for an earliest flight available she mentioned there was a flight but it’s all booked. What is the point in telling me about a flight if it’s all booked?,-1
2022-05-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst flight and customer experience,True,"  There was a five hour delay on this flight for a number of reasons - Inbound flight was late, the pilots headphone wasn’t working and the scariest (as described by the cabin crew) was they needed to “jump start” one of the engines! People were requesting to get off the plane when this was announced. At least ten people got off. Cabin crew extremely rude and all they said was they wanted to get home too. Worst flight and customer experience I have ever encountered.",-1

Two hour delay on Orlando to New Orleans route (1st May 2022) and a two hour delay on New Orleans to Orlando route (4th May 2022). No offer of refreshments, no compensation, no reason for the delays and crew didn’t even know why there were delays when we asked them. I will tell all of my UK friends to avoid Spirit airlines and look for alternative carriers. Absolutely appalling!",-1

I asked 3 different employees about the delay and received 3 different answers, the third employee was asleep at the boarding gate. They do not offer anything complimentary, including water. The seats don't recline. The plane was dirty and uncomfortable. Later, I received an email offering a $50 voucher for future travel. The bag fee was $60! They could have at least reimbursed us for the bag fee, if they wanted to make a meaningful gesture. Never again will fly this airline, it is truly the worst ""ghetto air"" in the world!!",-1

He left on April 29th and arrived at Fort Lauderdale to connect to Colombia. The flight was supposed to leave at 10:45 but left at 1:30ish almost 2 pm.. Now he's on his way back and same thing, flight delayed and now he won't be able to get home tonight because he will loose his connecting flight to Denver from FLL. Not only he has to go through immigration, security and then look for the gate which he won't be able to make it in 25 min. Spirit supposedly gave him a voucher for $50 for the first flight for the delay ... we don't care about that. I wish they could schedule their flights accordingly and give a layover like they do in other flights but no! Or because they know a lot of people its connecting, they have to give them time. Sometimes cheaper doesn't mean better. I don't think we will fly with them again.",-1

We had a carry on that was free to travel with. At the gate the gate attendant and supervisor charged me and my son $78 each, total $156. The supervisor was very rude and discriminating. They let the passengers in front and behind of us pass with even bigger carry on and didn’t say anything. My husband had the same carry on and they didn’t notice and he got to pass through the gate. The fellow was so rude and unprofessional. When we came back we travelled with the same carry on and we were fine.

I am in a rental car at this time driving 10 hours home due to the inefficiency, poor management, and lack of organization we experienced at Orlando Airport. We arrived 2.5 hours early for our flight. Once we got our boarding passes and bag tags we were routed and re-routed 3 different times to different long lines by Spirit Staff. The TSA line was very long, but we would have made our flight if we had experienced an organized system with Spirit check in. I have never seen anything like it. About 20 of us missed our flight and another 20 missed their flights to Vegas. So now my family is traveling in a rental with a 10 month old and pregnant mom. We have to drive to RDU; turn in the rental; find our luggage; and then drive another 2 hours home. Just pay the extra $$. It is not worth what you save to travel with Spirit. I will not again",-1

2022-05-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,This was by far the worst experience,False,"  This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I checked into my flight April 2 for my flight on April 3. My flight was early at 6 AM so I could go to work the next day. Spirit abruptly cancelled my flight at 9 pm April 2. Not even giving me 24 hours. The next flight available to rebook was April 4. I got on the flight and when I went home called them and said I would like a refund or voucher on the flight because not only did I have to stay at a hotel another day, pay for parking and miss an extra 2 days of work. It is the least they could do. They told me no. Since I got on the flight on April4, & despite their horrible service, there was nothing they could do. I have worked in the service industry and when you do not provide a service to people who pay for it, there are consequences. They held no responsibility, and basically told me too bad so sad. From now on I will pay more for a flight & the reliability with United & Delta.",-1

I went on the app to review things and find out about baggage fees. Couldn’t find my reservation. Went on their website with the same results. I then called the airline and was informed that my reservation was cancelled by Spirit because they no longer have a flight that day. NO notification. NO email. NO text. NO phone call.  If I hadn’t called, I would have been at the airport trying to get a flight. Want to know the best (worst) part? They said they’d be happy to refund my money. Well, you bet your butt you’re going to refund my money! If I hadn’t called not only would I have not known about the cancellation, they apparently would’ve just pocketed the money!",-1

After 30 days, I received a note back saying the credit would be applied to my next flight but that flight had to be by June 2022. I called Spirit to let them know I only fly Spirit once a year so would like the credit to my CC or have the date extended thru March 2023. They refused and so the result is that I had to pay $50 for a bag I didn't travel with. I consider this a bad business practice so I am following up everywhere I can.",-1

We paid an upcharge per seat to pick our seats 3 months before our flight. When we checked in 24 hours before our flight our seats were randomly changed not sitting together. When we called we were basically told sorry. Nothing we can do and they wouldn’t refund our $150 we paid for the upgrade. Our flight is tomorrow. We do not recommend Spirit.

2022-04-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fail to disappoint me,False,"  Spirit Airlines never fail to disappoint me! I already heard of its notorious before but decide to give it a try. The first time I flew to Las Vegas for my friend’s birthday and got delay for 3 hrs when the weather was not even bad. They delayed before flying and when they’d landed, they couldn’t even get a gate for more than 1hr. The second time i flew from Boston to Atlanta, I decided to give it a chance a it’s a short flight and more flexible, so I thought “what can go wrong?”. 3 hrs before flying time, they sent us a message saying flight will be delayed for 1 hr. We then decided to came to the airport a little later. But 1 hr before the boarding time, they sent a new message said “the flight is back on time”. How can anybody make it on time with such last minute notice? So we have to had our flight rescheduled for the next day. But thanks god like I said we were flexible so no big deal. The following day we came to the airport and got delay for more than 3 hours and not even cu the weather problem! They told us it was because of the technical problem and the technician has been there for more than 3 hrs till couldn’t get anything done. I’m still waiting right now. Please never fly with Spirit, even with the good price its not worth it. Save your time, money, and health",-1
2022-04-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Raleigh NC to Orlando Florida,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,do not fall for the cheap rates Spirit offers,True," First off I did not end up flying with this airline. I cancelled my ticket the same day of purchase and was refused a refund. This was my first time attempting to fly Spirit Airlines. I saw online a very good deal on a one way flight. $87 from Raleigh to Orlando. What they don’t tell you about this good price is that baggage is not free. By not free I mean $200 for one bag however, the Spirit Airlines website states that you can have a free personal item such as a small bag or a laptop. I explained to Spirit that I was only bringing a laptop bag with me and the lady argued on the phone with me that I had to pay $200 to bring my laptop. I explained to her that the website states it’s free. She continued to call me a liar and tell me I was wrong. I asked to speak to her manager and was given the same rude attitude and told I had to pay $200 to bring my laptop. I cancelled my flight the same day I booked it and asked for a refund and was told since the ticket was under $100 I would not receive a refund. I cancelled my flight anyway and booked with Delta for $169. For anyone reading this review, do not fall for the cheap rates Spirit offers because if you plan to bring anything other than yourself your ticket will end up costing much more than a real airline such as delta, American, or United.",-1

The flight ended up being canceled and I had to sleep on the floor in the airport. This was my first experience with the airline and I decided that after all of the issues even some that I’m not listing I wouldn’t choose to book with them again. Unfortunately my negativity toward the company dwindled with time (I had forgotten how bad the experience actually was.) Until the last flight I took, it was last resort and the only option and I had faith in the company. Well this time I didn’t get my flight canceled but my one hour layover turned into an over 7.5 hour layover and I didn’t get home until 2:30 in the morning and booked myself to work the next day. I would have planned my day back much differently had I known I was going to have to travel for 21 hours straight due to the severe change.  I was inconvenienced, but OK with the small amount of room my seat provided and the fact that we had less than ideal seats with trays big enough to hold a pen, nor do the seats recline. This was a 5 hour flight and a cup of water or some actual food for Purchase would have helped a lot. I couldn’t even have a cup of water on the plane without paying $3.50 for it with a credit card.",-1
2022-04-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Cancun,,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,advise me that it is too late to board,False,"  Only chose this “airline” because I had a $200 credit from a previous cancelation due to Covid, so I figured I would give it a shot.  My outgoing flight was expected to leave @ 8am, I arrived @ the airport @ 6:30, granted traffic was a mess, I can conceive that however, kiosk were not working properly, after happily accepted my $64 bag fee, I spent 10/mins trying to get my passport to scan, w/assistance. I was advised to go to the help desk or in my case the “helpless desk” and spent another 10/mins in line to get checked in, just for the Rep to advise me that it is too late to board!  I would have to pay $100 rebooking fee and fly out the next day which for me was a hell to the no as my vacation started Fri not Sat morning. Since I was already at the airport I decided that if I’m going to pay anything additional that $100 would go a more reliable airline, so I booked on American leaving out same day @ 2PM for $270 (one way). I called Spirit Customer Service to request a refund for just spending $64 dollars bag fee at the kiosk that apparently don’t scan passport but “humbly accepts baggage fees” & the huge inconvenience of not being able to board my flight. The Rep did apologize about the inconvenience and applied a $81 credit towards my next flight or bags. I Specifically asked for confirmation that my “departure flight back was still booked”, the Rep once again apologize for the inconvenience and advised that I was good to go. Long story short Spirit completely abandon me in Cancun by canceling my departure flight. The thing that’s most unsettling I never received a email, text, IOU letter. I had to pay another $588 (one way) on Southwest.",-1
2022-04-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to New Orleans,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,don’t recommend Spirit Airlines,False,"  First time flying with Spirit Airlines and it’s not the best airline that I’ve been on! I do want to mention that when I flew out of Pittsburgh to Tampa, I had a connection flight immediately following to go to New Orleans. We were delay about 20 min in Pittsburgh but when we landed in Tampa, for those who had connection to New Orleans, were able to get back on the same aircraft without racing to the next gate to catch the connection. That was very thoughtful for this airline to do! Some of the staff were very rude, but there was one flight attendant that was hilarious and made us laugh. Carry-on bags are expensive and the drinks/snacks are not free. You even have to pay for the water which is crazy and like $3.16. Even though their thoughtfulness and making sure their customers were able to make their flight to NOLA, I still don’t recommend Spirit Airlines.",-1

2022-04-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst experience I’ve had,True,"  Worst experience I’ve had in my 20 years of flying! This was the first time we flew with Spirit Airlines and will be the last. They say the airfare is the cheapest but its not. The ticket is cheap, then you have to pay for the luggage that can’t weigh over 40lbs. Unlike other airlines thats 50lbs. The price for your 40lbs luggage is $67 a lot more than the other airlines. So you get less for a higher price. The seats don’t recline, you don’t have any kind of entertainment unless you bring your own and pay for the WiFi. Yes, you have to pay, not just download the app for free like other airlines. You don’t get anything, not even water or a tiny bag of peanuts. You must pay for everything. Not only do the seats not recline like I mentioned earlier, you can’t charge your electronics. It’s literally the bare flight. I can’t say the bare minimum because you get less than the bare minimum. Worst flight I’ve have ever been in. To top it off. For the first time my luggage was missing. Apparently, it was left behind and I would get it the next day. It wasn’t just my luggage. A few other passengers were in the same situation. Beside an apology you’re shit out of luck with whatever extra expenses or inconveniences you have to deal with.",-1
2022-04-21,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Philadelphia via Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,The only thing they have is attitude,True,"  After arriving to Las Vegas to catch the next flight to Philadelphia we discovered one of their flight crew didn't show up. They delayed the flight from 9:45 pm to 7 am next day after waiting hour and half. When many passengers raised hell they announced everyone will receive an email for hotel and meal voucher. But first they have to pick up their luggage. Luggages were delayed for additional hour and half. At this point it was 11:30 pm already. I did not receive email nor a text. I approached their customer assistance and they entered my information again. A side note, yes I have their app and I always receive notifications and advertisements from them. Anyway by the time I received an email it was past 12:20 AM. It didn't make sense to go to find transportation and hotel for couple of hours and back at the gate by 6 am. Personal loss: a days full of meeting and interviews plus additional day for airport parking. At this point I hope my pets are OK since I have no coverage for tomorrow until I get home. This is the 3rd time I was burnt by this airline. Never again! They are not capable of running any kind of schedule and not reliable. Not to mention they have the hardest landing among any airlines I flew during my years. The only thing they have is attitude and that is negative as well.",-1

They have changed our departure flight multiple times on us. Then we had to change our flight and their customer service was awful. They hung up on us multiple times, they wanted to overcharge us, and could never get us a straight answer. They made our vacation extremely stressful and I will never fly with them again.",-1

When getting to my Airbnb at around 6pm, I’ve noticed I’ve forgotten my laptop inside the plane. I immediately went back to the airport and spoke with the baggage services at Terminal B and was advised I had to fill out an online form and was given a number to call the morning after as they would not bring the lost and found from the terminal until after 1am. No one would answer the number I was given and after leaving several messages I never got a call back, so I returned to the airport the next day in the afternoon and my computer was still not found. Long story short - during my stay of 5 nights in Orlando I physically went back to the airport 3 times to search for my computer that was nowhere to be found and the staff did the bare minimum to look for it, to be honest they were waiting for the computer to show up if anything. Now it’s been 2 weeks since it happened and still no updates or sign of the computer which makes me think it got stolen either by the plane cleaners or a staff terminal since it never made its way to the concierge or baggage services lost and found. I’ve filed a police report at the Orlando MCO airport but also wanted to share my frustration and disappointment. Spirit is definitely the worst airline you could choose to fly based on their customer service.",-1

I didn't have any difficulty with checking in, baggage, or boarding. I do have a return flight on Spirit from Orlando. So I guess I just lucked out with the service. The staff were polite, helpful, and friendly at check in and on the flight. So I don't have a bad review so far. I'll update my review, if possible, for the return flight.",1
2022-04-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Orlando, Fl to Minneapolis, MN",,,,,,1.0,1.0,Very very disappointing!,True,"  Canceled flight with no notification given. Worst customer service ever. I found out my flight was canceled when attempting to retrieve a boarding pass from the kiosk. I stood in line for a half hour and told the young girl at the counter I could not obtain a boarding pass. She told me the flight was canceled and offered no explanation or apology. Told me I have to go across the room to talk to other people at a different counter. I stood in that line for over an hour with approximately 50 other people who are dealing with the same canceled flights. Entire staff including supervisor at the airport and supervisor on the phone were extremely rude and disrespectful and condescending. One gal was texting on her personal phone for 5 mins before helping others in line. No one from Spirit cared the flight was canceled and kept stating email notification was sent which it never was. No one ever offered apology or any help in getting me home same day. I asked why Spirit Airlines and Trip.com app both showed the flight was on schedule and later showed the flight was actually enroute. They gave no reasoning. When I asked to see the email that was sent the supervisor refused stating he did not have time to talk with me any further. There were several other people waiting to speak with a supervisor about their canceled flights with no notification also. Only options given was a refund for the ticket price or reschedule two days later. Spirit Airlines would not pay for a hotel, rental car, or food for the inconvenience. They have the power to totally disrupt peoples lives and they don’t care! It cost me $400 to reschedule a flight with another airline and another six hours to wait. If I could give spirit airlines a score of zero out of 10 I would. Very very disappointing! I will never use Spirit Airlines ever again.",-1

After trying for multiple days to book online and being told it was an invalid confirmation number, I called. They helped me and said there would be no additional charges because the codes were not working even for them at first, but of course I wasnt told they would charge me $80 for a checked bag!

Now to cancel a future flight because I obviously will never do that again, they are saying the cancellation will be $150. Just waiting for the flight to actually get canceled. Very unreliable and unhelpful. My flight was supposed to be at 4pm, they waited until midnight to tell us the flight was canceled leaving me stranded in the airport with all food and everything else closed! Don’t let the cheap fare entice you, the flight does not exist. Cost me $2000 to get there and I still haven’t seen a refund.",-1

I offered myself as volunteered and was provided with the volunteer voucher information. I offered myself as volunteer, but after having being re-routed ok a flight to an alternate airport not of my initial destination, Spirit is refusing to issue the voucher credit. I have spent hours on the phone and not even the customer service supervisor could help. I'm not kidding, at one point a CS rep told me that I had to return to San Juan and talk to their staff there.

First problem we never got an email to confirm our flight. Our flight was supposed to leave 1.39, April 5. Finally called them at 11pm the night before. They confirmed our flight but wouldn’t let us check in and pick our seats. They said we could do it at the airport. Of course by then the only seats left were middle seats and none together. When the plane took off it was rattling and  vibrating (truly was afraid). They charge $75 for check bags and carry ons ($150), ridiculous prices. You couldn’t even get a free glass of water. It was $3.50 for a glass of water. We had to circle our arrival airport twice because the plane was going too fast to land. Lastly they didn’t tell us what carousel our luggage would be at.",-1
2022-04-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Columbus,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never recommend Spirit Airlines,False,  My family and I have experienced a travel experience like nothing before. Myself as well as my partner & our children experienced sitting on an airplane for over 5 hours with continuous delays and unfortunate events ultimately resulting in us not being able to experience the Ohio state game that we were traveling to Columbus for. We've lost money on our tickets as well as excursions that we have prepaid for that we can not get our money back for due to the inability of your company being able to rebook my family and I on another flight that could get us to Columbus on time to make the game. The most egregious thing about this whole experience is the fact that ultimately my children as well as the other many infants and children were subjected to being on a flight for over 5 hours without being able to get any real food since the morning since our flight was originally due for take off at 9:20 am and didn't get canceled until 3:30 pm. I would think above all that a company should put the well being of children over anything else. The $84 meal voucher for a family of 5 and the $200 voucher that we must use by July was insulting to top off the horrible experience that we had. Missing out on a family trip that has been planned for months and being able to see family we haven't seen in almost 3 years due to the pandemic solely rests on your company's shoulders. I would never recommend Spirit Airlines to any of my family or friends especially while traveling with children due to the lack of concern that your airlines has shown.,-1
2022-04-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Worst flight experience ever,False,"  Worst flight experience ever! Our flight was canceled after we checked in our baggage and returned our rental car. They rebooked our flight for the next day same time, therefore we had to get another rental car and a hotel room. After checking into our hotel we decided to have a drink and chill to find out that the flight we rebooked was also canceled. Needless to say we had to extend our rental and drive back to Florida the next day, which took an extra 9 hours. Needless to say they will refund my $ and I will never book another flight with them.",-1
2022-04-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Miami,,,,,,1.0,1.0,canceled with no real explanation,True,"  My family and I had a direct flight from Hartford Conn. To Miami Florida. We where staying over night in Miami and boarding a cruise on April 16th. The plane arrived at the airport and it looked like we where going to board, then they announced that our flight was canceled with no real explanation, the plane was sitting at the terminal? They told all us passengers that we would have to find another flight to Miami. They did not bother to try to help anyone find another flight. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of care or effort to help any of us find a flight to our destination. I have spent a bunch of money on a hotel in Miami a cruise the next day and it was all not going to happen due to there was no flights in Hartford that would get us down to Miami on time. I will never fly Spirit again. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on another flight. And if Jet blue buys them it definitely will not change a thing. They are just as bad. Stick with American and Delta.",-1
2022-04-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Phoenix, AZ to Chicago, IL",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,my first and last time using Spirit Airlines,True," So I had a flight going to Chicago from Phoenix for today April 15 at 7pm and it was canceled around 12pm. I got no reason just offered me a $21 meal voucher (which expires April 16) and a hotel stay. I live in Phoenix so I didn't need the hotel and my flight is canceled so what am I using this voucher on? I was going to Chicago to surprise my mother for her birthday on the 16th. I got offered another flight that left on the 16th at 5.30pm but didn't arrive in Chicago until 6.30am Sunday morning. That was not helpful at all, especially since my return flight was Monday evening. This was my first and last time using Spirit Airlines because this is ridiculous.",-1
2022-04-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Detroit to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,delayed numerous times,True, Detroit to Orlando. Our flight was delayed numerous times in our original departure and our flight home. We paid for seats that they did not give us and have refused to refund and in doing so we got split up as a family. I with my young children sat next to a gentleman that was sick with a snotty nose and cough with my one-year-old daughter and my four-year-old son as my significant other had our other daughter behind me both of our daughters were lap infant. The gentleman next to me did not have a mask on even though they yelled at my four-year-old son to put his on as he was eating Skittles but the gentleman next to me who was sick very clearly didn't have to wear one and in turn being separated from the family and sat next to this person my children and myself are now sick.,-1
2022-04-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,BROOKLYN to BROOKLYN via BROOKLYN,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Awful customer service,True,"  Dreadful experience with this airline. We requested a credit extension for our flight that was cancelled due to the pandemic. We were told this was approved and would take 6 days to be received on our account. We therefore waited to book our flights, and the prices increased significantly - after 6 days, we called again and we were told the request was not approved and still under review. 2 weeks later the flight prices had risen so much our family holiday was ruined. I tried calling the airline customer services multiple times but they continued to hang up on me. Awful customer service. Do not recommend using this airline.",-1
2022-04-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Fort Myers,,,,,,,1.0,Don't waste your time or hard earned money,True,"  After having out tickets for over 2 months for spring break spirit sends an email rescheduling our flight a day earlier. We book a flight because that's when we are available and hey Spirit, where do you suppose we stay that extra night? Then you can't talk to anyone, your options are to reschedule (good luck), flight credit or refund. Guess what? 2 days later our original flight is still available for booking online? Don't waste your time or hard earned money, use a traditional airline and pay the extra $50 for a more trusted service and a better chance of actually getting there. The old saying is true, you get what you pay for ... or in Spirits world, it will cost you double because you are just another confirmation on the itinerary.",-1

2022-04-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,South Carolina to Hartford,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Do not fly Spirit unless you're willing to be stranded for days!,False,"  My family of 2 adults and 4 children were stranded in South Carolina for 2 days, Spirit kept cancelling our flights and not letting us know that they had to compensate us for our hotel stay until the last day because we brought it up to them! The food vouchers are a joke! You can only use them at the airport and not every restaurant takes it! We were not compensated for the car rental which we needed to go get food to feed the kids! The one time $50 flight voucher has to be used before July of this year and myself and my daughter lost time at work (wages lost). I had to add extra days to the kennel taking care of my pets because I was not going to be able to return in the time I had scheduled to pick them up! I’m waiting to see if Spirit compensates me for the hotel fee I paid because they again never told us they would pay for a hotel! We also had to pay extra for our luggage after we had initially paid! The reason our flights were cancelled (as told by Spirit) is due to lack of Staff!! We were also notified at the last minute of these cancellations! Do not fly Spirit unless you're willing to be stranded for days!",-1

I bought more than 30 days in advance, I booked a hotel, everything in advance. They simply canceled the flight with a few hours to go, I had to cancel the Hotel and lost all money, no refund for being in less than 24 hours. So I rescheduled the flight for two days later, and it happened again, they canceled with less than two hours left for the flight. This time I didn't have the courage to reschedule. I don't trust this company anymore. It caused me a lot of inconvenience for a trip that was well planned. I am really very angry and disappointed, it caused me a big problem as I was not able to make my trip at the necessary time.",-1
2022-04-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never use Spirit again,False,"  What a scam. If I could give them a negative rating I would. I flew with Spirit for the first time because I had to attend an unexpected funeral. On the morning of my return home, I got to the airport and was told the flight was cancelled due to weather - but there were other flights going out, so this didn't make sense. The Spirit Rep printed out a receipt of the flight information, which showed I was to be refunded $391.50 (which included the flight and the ""boost"" of seat option and one checked bag). I saw a refund pending on my credit card for $169. When I phoned Spirit to confirm my refund, the amounts she was reading off were totally different. I attempted to review the receipt with her verbally, but no matter what I said, she kept just repeating that incorrect amount. I will never use Spirit again, and they should be shamed for their business practices.",-1
2022-04-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Minneapolis,,,,,,1.0,1.0,a last minute cancellation,False,  Today I was supposed to fly with sprit airline. If I could give this airline a negative star rating for my experience I would. My flight was supposed to board around 12:30 from Las Vegas to Minnesota. At 12:20 we looked at our phones to see our flights were canceled. Very convenient for us the sprit airlines representative by our gate left about 5 to 10 minutes before emails were sent out. So not only did we get a last minute cancellation but we also had no one to assist us and hundreds of other people who thought they were about to get on the plane. Then trying to contact customer service was a nightmare. The person on the phone did not understand what I was trying to say and was extremely rude. I have not flown much but I just spoke with a representative from American Airlines and it’s worth the money. The lady was very understanding and extremely helpful and seemed more apologetic for spirt airlines then any of their employees. At the end of this spend the money for much higher quality service then this garbage airline!,-1
2022-04-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Do not fly with Spirit,True,"  Flight back from Vegas was cancelled due to staffing. Their email for confirming our rebooking on a flight tomorrow said to call for a refund of we didn't want to be rebooked. When called, customer service claimed that because we rebooked on a competent airline, they can't refund our money. This airline is a parasite. It will suck your dry of your funds and hold onto them like the leech they are. In the past, my flights with them were equally terrible - charging people for a cup of water when the flight was delayed an hour after it had pushed back from the gate but couldn't get to the runway yet. The least they could have done was give people free water in that situation. But no. Do not fly with Spirit.",-1
2022-04-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,will never recommend Spirit,True,"  Our flight was canceled from New Orleans to Orlando and the best the company had to offer was a flight that's wasn't till 5 days later and refused to comp any hotel or meal. They claimed it was canceled due to weather even though there were 6 other flights, 1 also being another spirit flight, to the same destination that went without delay within 2 hrs of the cancelation. I stood in line for 2 and half hrs and stayed on hold with their customer service for over 4 hrs. Multiple passengers in the line with us were told it was canceled due to staffing until the airline changed their narrative so they didn't have to provide lodging to any of the passenger they had just abandoned. We were told to wait 5 days and that they wouldn't give us any hotel or attempt to book through another airline. Worst experience I've ever had flying, and will never recommend Spirit and will go out of my way to make sure nobody I know uses them.",-1
2022-04-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Tampa,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,can't provide a reliable service,False," Indianapolis to Tampa. I recently booked two flights with Spirit. First was for trip from IND to TPA on 4/3/2022, the second was from TPA to IND on 4/10/2022. The flight was for a cruise sailing on 4/3/2022. I show up and IND airport 3 hours early just to be informed my flight has been cancelled. They offered a refund or to rebook next available flight which was at least two days out. The cruise that I paid over $1000 was sailing that day so it was clear to take refund as other option not feasible. I had to end up booking another flight with a different airline to fly to the first port the ship was sailing to to catch the ship and board there. Spirit did not offer any assistance whatsoever besides offer rebook or refund. On return from my cruise I get to the airport 5 hours before flight just to find out yet again my flight from TPA to IND has been cancelled. Again the option was next available flight in two days or refund. Flight in two days would me taking two more days off work that I cannot get back and not counting the two days I already lost at the start of my cruise. I noticed they had flight to DTW from TPA in about 2 hours from the time I was talking to the agent. I had them put me on that flight to get me closer to home and rented a car to drive home. When we get to DTW we had to sit just off terminal until people showed up to guide us in to terminal, move jetway to plane for us to exit and unload baggage. It was like they were not prepared or expecting the plane to be there. They were nice enough to give me a $50 voucher to user by July 7, 2022. There should be no expiration on it but it does not matter because I do not plan on booking a flight with them that may never leave. I have flown Spirit in the past and thought they were good at that time. I will never fly with Spirit again. I gave them benefit of the doubt when flight from IND to TPA was cancelled but when I returned to TPA a week later to fly back to IND that flight also being cancelled sealed the deal or should I say the straw that broke the camels back. Spirit does not seem to know who their customers are. They are working people that have limited time to take off from work and funds to invest in vacations. If they can't provide a reliable service they need to get out of the flight business",-1

The breakdown of charges in e-mail confirmation did not match what the customer representative had in her system. I was charged twice, I had to call for a refund. ""Government's Cut"" in the amount of $81.17 was added to total cost, the cost was not disclosed during booking. Then, found out a loyalty membership fee was added $59 as well, I did not sign up for a membership nor was that disclosed on the confirmation e-mail cost breakdown.

2022-04-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit canceled both my flights,False,"  Spirit canceled both my flights and wouldn't make a reasonable attempt at making it right. Canceled flight from Cleveland and had no other flights to rebook for 2-3 days. Same thing happened on return from Las Vegas. Even at their help desk (I laugh as I use the word ""help"", they wouldn't print off any confirmation of anything they promised such as hotel stay for 2 nights since they couldn't fly me out for over 48 hours after the original flight. Then they only gave 1 night at the hotel. It is impossible to contact them by phone. They turned off online chat support because they are overwhelmed. Been on hold for over an hour and still no end to the wait in sight. So I asked the guy at the counter, ""So you're giving me nothing - I am just to trust that you will do this right?"" He said, ""Yes"". As if knowing they can't even keep their flights going, wasn't already evidence enough they can't do things right.",-1
2022-04-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Indianapolis,,,,,,,1.0,would never fly with them again,True,"  They cancelled both of my flights. O give them props for the first one they gave me enough notice to find a flight where i was going but they didn't give me a refund, tried sending me vouchers as a refund when i asked for my money back. When it came time to come home i got no notice, missed out on work, stuck with no rental cars. I would never fly with them again, and it made me value to pay more to get a flight that is reliable. They cant use weather when no other flight was cancelled or even delayed. My child is missing school due to this and its ridiculous cost me lots of money and i still havent gotten a refund.",-1
2022-04-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,pay the extra money and fly another airline,False,"  Flight was canceled last minute. I understand that it is not the fault of the customer service agents but they were not apologetic at all, would not reimburse for any additional costs that it cost their customers, and the worst of all was that 2 of the customer service agents were even cussing at the customers. This is by far the absolute worst customer service I have experienced anywhere and I can’t believe an airline would allow this. In the end it was my fault for trying to go cheap, you definitely get what you pay for (and so much worse)! Please pay the extra money and fly another airline!!",-1
2022-04-11,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Punta cana,,,,,,,1.0,canceled the flight 3 hours prior,False,  We actually didn't get to fly. We had our honeymoon booked in Punta Cana and spirit canceled the flight 3 hours prior to take off with no flights available for the next 4 days. So we had to cancel the honeymoon and I am out 3400 dollars now because the resort doesn't accept cancels the day of and the Spirit airlines is refusing to compensate me for the resort fees. They canceled the flight for weather in Ohio and we were flying from Philadelphia to Punta Cana which doesn't come within 200 miles of Ohio . But if they cancel for weather then they don't have to compensate you such a total scam. They are a fraud of a company and should he banned from doing business,-1

2022-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,aircraft itself was subpar,True," Seattle to Las Vegas. Little did I know what we had in store for us. My husband and I were traveling with our 3 and 1 year olds to my brothers wedding. There was no carry on and baggage had exorbitant prices. We arrived late to the airport due to traffic and made it to the gate just as boarding started. We couldn’t fill our water bottles with the rush, and ended up spending 3.50$ for a single water bottle for our 1 year old who was really thirsty. The aircraft itself was subpar. There was no reclining, no little pouch on the back to hold anything. Then we had to go back to Seattle. We wake up at 3:30am to make it to the airport in time, and right as we get to the airport 3 hours later we receive info that our flight is cancelled. We go to ticketing and upon seeing our little girls and agent puts us in what she said was essentially the fast lane. After waiting 30 minutes, we make it to the agent who tells us he can’t help us and that the line we actually wanted was further down, and had at least 25+ people in it already. We waited another 3 hours to talk to an agent. She was actually helpful and booked us a flight to return as soon as she could, which was the next day at 5pm. So now we had to find a hotel. We finally found one but couldn’t check in until 3pm. The airline would only reimburse us for up to $150 for the hotel and 7$ for a taxi. There was only 50$ reimbursement per ticket for all the hassle after cancelling our flight when other airlines have given us a free flight. Thankfully our return flight is with Alaska who we’ve always been impressed with. Do not fly with Spirit if at all possible.",-1

2022-04-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,Beyond beyond awful in every single way,True," By far the worst airline in the history of airlines. They cancel flights constantly with zero explanation right before the flight is set to arrive. Not only that, they never have a solution for you. If your flight is canceled with them you are effectively screwed, no money back, figure it out on your own. I don’t know how this airline still exists and/or hasn’t been sued into bankruptcy. Beyond beyond awful in every single way. And everyone knows it, even the poor, miserable people working there. The day this airline is bought out by another airline who tries to care a single bit about their customers is going to be a good day for all.",-1

Delays, cancelations and gave lousy 50 dollar voucher as if I'll ever use them again. Pay the little extra with united or someone else. Not even a complimentary water for the inconvenience. I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. Pathetic and not worth the savings. 5 hour delay going to Vegas and hour n half delay coming back. My sisters flight was cancelled 3 times and she is stuck in Vegas bc of their cancelations. Won't even put her up in hotel since no more flights tonight. They are the worst.",-1
2022-04-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Sacramento,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,Still haggling to get compensation,False,"  Very disappointed. Still haggling with the airline to get compensation back after they had cancelled all flights that they are trying to claim was “due to weather” however the poor lady working at the gate did not know what was going on as myself and all other passengers were waiting for over an hour after the plane should have left. She stated that the crew simply “did not show up.” There were no other options from Spirit for me to get home and I had to pay $400 out of pocket (which was the cheapest) to get to a city 2 hours away from my home and call my family to drive and come pick me up. Please save yourself the time, money, and hassle and go with a different airline. Sadly, it does not seem like spirit values their customers.",-1
2022-04-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to El Salvador,,,,,,,1.0,proof that we did not used the credit,True,"  The worst experience ever with this airline in regards to credits. I was unable to flight due to family health problems and I was giving an airline credit to use on a different date. This was over $2000 and I used $100 of that credit. That was all the money this airline let me used. When I was ready to used the rest of the money credit I was told it has been already used by the members of my family. Obviously their system was hacked and they are accusing me of this. As of right now they have not resolved this issue. I have proof that we did not used the credit. The credit was for my wife and my 3 children and we did not go anywhere. Stay away from this airline, the customer service don't even know what they are doing, they pretend they are supervisors, managers, and specialist but they all say the same thing and the worst part is they don't care about the customers. I'm very disappointed and I feel insulted because they make it sound like I stole the credit and I want to get more free money which is not the case.",-1
2022-04-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Avoid this airline,False," Boston to Tampa. Avoid this airline at any cost. Spirit Airlines is by far the worst airline I have ever used. Our flight from Boston was delayed 2 hours. When we went to get on the plane they told us we have to check our bags even though they were carry on size for any other airline. They charged us $284 dollars for 3 small bags which we have taken on our last flight with Delta with no charge. Needless to say we had to pay an additional $207 for the flight home. Total of $491 additional just for bags. The seating on the plane is totally uncomfortable, there's nothing as far as music or tv. The flight back to Boston from Tampa was delayed twice for a total of 5 hours. I cant even put words on what I think might be the worst run company I have ever dealt with. I will 100% stay home than go on Spirit again.",-1
2022-04-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Los Angeles,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,completely miss the mark,True, Columbus to Los Angeles. I've booked with Spirit 4 times in the last 2 months. I've actually only flown 2 times. My first flight out of Indianapolis to Las Vegas we arrived within time but had to wait on a long line and they refused to check our bags that were paid for because they stopped taking bags for our flight 5 minutes prior. They told us to take our luggage to the car and just get on the plane. We opted to not travel for 5 days without any clothes or toiletries. We booked with Delta to fly out a few hours later. I returned to the Spirit counter and notified them we had secured another flight. The night before we were to return home I found out my flight had been canceled because we had not flown with them to our destination. I explained the situation to customer service and that I had notified their help at the airline counter in Indianapolis. I ended up having to pay a second time for the flight I had already paid for. It also cost twice as much. I decided to give them another chance. March 29th we flew from Columbus Ohio to LAX in first class. That flight went well. It's a budget airline - I get it. They nickle and dime you for everything. My checked bag was 45# so I paid an extra premium for that. At that point I wasn't unpacking my bag to remove anything so I paid them we flew and wasn't really upset about it. The flight home sealed the deal. We will never fly with them again. We arrived to the airport. Checked in for our flight. We again paid the premium for our bag. We then waited 3 hours only for them to keep pushing our flight back then to cancel it. All of their staff left the area before the announcement was made. It was a full flight. We were all told to return to the ticket counter for assistance with booking a different flight. Ultimately after being told they just weren't able to help me unless I was willing to wait for a flight until Friday - it was Tuesday. I have a job and so does my husband - so that wasn't an option. Finally they said they could book us with another airline. I thought this was going to be an answer - nope! They wanted us to fly out on Tuesday night and arrive in Columbus Friday morning after midnight and pay an additional $600. Ultimately I requested a refund. I'm still waiting on that. I was not refunded for my heavy bag. They completely miss the mark with any type of customer service. Their screw you attitude is unacceptable when they're not doing their job. Never again! Both times I've used them they haven't been budget friendly because nothing is included. Spend the extra money and use a reputable airline. You're going to spend it anyway before they are done itemizing charges.,-1
2022-04-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Charlotte via Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,just unacceptable,False," Phoenix to Charlotte via Las Vegas. Worst experience of my life. Flew Into Las Vegas on March 22nd for a one-night layover and didn't get to my destination until April 6th. They cancelled two flights and didn't book us on the next flight out. We had one night in Vegas and had our luggage and purse stolen at the stratosphere. So we returned to the airport to find our flight cancelled the airline did not contact us to let us know. We also had our bank account frozen for 5 days unrelated to the airline but went to get on our flight and found it cancelled and were told the next flight out wasn't for 4 more days. We were not accommodated at all so slept at the airport for 4 days. We had booked for the next flight out and when we went to check-in 4 days later they couldn't find us on the computer so went ahead and rebooked us for stand by another day later. In total, we were stuck in Vegas for 2 weeks. Not once given a hotel or apology but were treated very rudely. This airline overbooks flights and cancels more flights without explanation. I will never ever fly this airline again after this terrible experience. I don't know how they are even in business. Sat next to a passenger who missed the birth of his child because of these cancelled flights, and this is just unacceptable",-1

I had a flight from BWI with a connecting flight from Dallas to PHX from 7 April until 10 April 2022. First thing our flight was delayed 2 hours, which wasn't too bad. After the plane's arrival they allowed us to board sitting inside the plane for one hour, then telling us due to mechanical issues the plane can't turn on. They got us a new plane three hours later and told all of us that the next flight would be awaiting us in Dallas. When we finally arrived in Dallas, no one helped us so we walked around aimlessly trying to find assistance. We finally found someone who them told us do to another mechanical issue your connecting flight is canceled. They tried re-booking us for the 9th of April at 5pm which would have been the entire weekend and trip. Asked for a refund I still haven't received it even though I had flight protection. I had to book a brand new flight for 500 extra dollars. Moral of the story never ever fly Spirit, please stay far far away!",-1

No customer service, left me stranded in Lima for 2 nights after making a mistake with my ticket and cancelling flight. Ticket was $600, so not even that budget friendly. JetBlue was cheaper and excellent. Do not fly spirit, they are a terrible airline that need to go out of business, I wasted time and money with them. The staff are indifferent and totally unhelpful. How are they still in business?",-1
2022-04-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Tampa,,,,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled 10 min before the flying time,True,  One of the worst airlines I have seen in the last 25 years. My flight were cancelled abruptly 10 min before the flying time. There were no alternative flights that Spirit provided.

I was booked a Delta flight for my connection. I missed my connecting flight because we had to deplane to do another head count.

Showed up for a flight, it was delayed saying they’re waiting for a flight attendant, then just canceled the flight an hour after we were supposed to take off with no explanation. Then send the entire plane to rebook at the Spirit counter however nothing was available for three days. No hotel offered, no free ticket, no help with booking on another airline, so all the extra money I have to spend to try to find a place and get home late to miss important events, Spirit just doesn’t care. Their chat function for help I have been in a queue for 24 hours. Their one 800 number was less than helpful and hard to understand the people. It took four hours to get up to the rebooking gate for them to tell me the exact same thing which is nothing cook it out for three days. I will absolutely never fly them again. They don’t care about their customers and will chest you out of money with a smile. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs!",-1

I messed up on to and from and wanted it switched. It seems simple enough, the same flight just mixed up from and to, but they did all they could to be difficult and wanted more money to do it. I can’t stress enough how the customer service made me feel as though they are definitely not listening even when you are at your most vulnerable.

I’m a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu competitor and was supposed to be in Orlando around 12am 4/5 to make it a little early to rest up and compete. Because of this cancelation its unsure whether i will be able to compete and i could lose multiple sponsorship deals if i am not in Florida by 4/6 early morning. My flight was rebooked but has at this moment been delayed several hours and will have to go from the airport straight to the competition venue IF we make it on time. Awful experience on an airline.,-1
2022-04-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to New Orleans,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the most incompetent airline,True,"  By far the most incompetent airline. They cancelled my flight 30 minutes after the flight was supposed to take off. Then we, the passengers, were told “weather” and “misplaced pilots and crews” were the issue which is weird because no other airline had this issue. I lost out on money for the hotel that I booked, as well as vacation time from work — none of which Spirit was able to reimburse. I’m embarrassed to even say I booked a trip with this airline. You get what you pay for! Just spend the extra money for a quality airline.",-1

They canceled the flight 2.5 hours before we were supposed to leave. No representative came to the ticket counter until three hours later. Even the airport people were paging them and still hours went by before someone actually showed up. Once they showed up we got % lied to. Spirit employee said we would be flying from Seattle to New York then leaving that airport to fly to Charlotte. Once we finally made it to New York I was told at JFK after, they laughed at me they don’t fly to Charlotte period. When she checked what the spirit counter did in Seattle she said “you have to find a way to New Jersey that’s where he booked your next your plane to fly from. It was a complete nightmare we ended up spending $142.00 plus tip on a cab going through Queens New York the Bronx etc. very dangerous, very costly, very stressful. There is no person to speak with no one will answer the phones from Spirit we’ve been on hold for hours and hours on several different occasions.

Seems unwise). They lied to us and said they could only offer passengers $1000 travel vouchers, even though a family of 4 offered to take the vouchers if they bumped it to $1200. But they thought that the additional 200 per voucher was too much when they could instead lie to people who don’t have the time to argue with them over their contract of carriage and screw them over. Afterwards they lied to us saying we couldn’t get a refund and they could only offer travel vouchers through spirit. It took hours of arguing before they finally gave us compensation which is not worth the stress and time involved in finding people to manage your pets and missing an additional day of work. Their cheap prices will never be worth it again.",-1

I could write a novel on all the reasons not to fly with Spirit. I’m a budget girl, but Spirit ended up costing me and over 1,500 people in Atlanta more money with all of their canceled flights. At least 9 of 15 outgoing Spirit flights were canceled in Atlanta on 04/03/2022 due to “weather.” Somehow Delta (and most other airlines) were able to fly, though. My girlfriends and I planned a girls trip to Atlanta. One friend flew Delta Detroit to Atlanta, I flew Spirit Detroit to Atlanta. Our flights were scheduled within an hour or two of each other. Delta was on time, no problems, both ways. My Spirit arrival flight was delayed 2 hours, my departure flight was canceled last minute for “weather.” No outbound flights available for 4 days, no hotel or rental car assistance. All people on canceled flights were booking any other flights they could get. I ended up having to fly out to another state and drive 5+ hours to get home. Further my girlfriend from Wisconsin flow Spirit flight from Wisconsin to Atlanta, meeting us. She was delayed 2 hours and her return flight delayed 4 hours. Still haven’t been able to get a refund from Spirit, it’s crickets on all methods of communication - phone, messaging app, text service line and email. I’ve tried them all. I flew out Delta and it was worth every penny for the smooth, on time flight. Pay the extra money for Delta to begin with, or you’ll end up paying for the Spirit flight and the Delta flight when Spirit leaves you stranded and you need to get home.",-1

When I get there, despite me having all my pre check credentials and malfunctioning spirit qr code, the front desk said that because it's now 55 minutes or less (it was like 51 minutes) before the departure they cannot issue me a physical boarding pass and I therefore missed my flight and had to sleep in the airport and reschedule for the next day. On top of that, they actually tried to make me pay $100 for a rebooking despite the fact that the only reason I missed my flight was because their precheck QR codes did not scan and they had ridiculous policy that wouldn't let me get a physical pass. I had to fight for a free rebooking and sleep on the floor until the next day. Flying from Atlanta to Hawaii. Had a connecting flight in LA with a 4 hour layover. Atlanta flight got delayed with no prior warning. Ended up delayed about 3 hours. Got to LA late, missed my connecting flight. Had to rebook to fly into Honolulu instead of Maui. Had to buy my own ticket from Maui to Honolulu on my own dime. Slept overnight at Honolulu Airport to catch a 6am flight to Maui. This is the only way for me to not miss the experience which was the only reason I was going to Hawaii in the first place. No travel voucher or refund given. Last and final time ever taking this airline. April 3 flight from Vegas back to Atlanta. Get an email about 6 hours before the flight saying our flight is canceled, not delayed but cancelled. No reasoning behind it, luckily I check my email frequently. No way to manually reschedule, it's the weekend so the customer support Is down. They automatically rescheduled me for a flight landing on April 8th.",-1

I planned a 4 day trip with my 7-year-old granddaughter to visit my mother. We were to leave at 10pm which was perfect because she could sleep on the plane. ONE HOUR before we were to leave for the airport, I got the cancellation email. I panicked but was luckily able to rebook for 8 am the next morning. I was disappointed because I lost the money on the hotel I booked for the night we got in, but I could get over that. Fast forward to 11 pm, I am in bed, and something tells me to check my email before I go to bed, and AGAIN, my new flight was canceled! There were no available flights for that next day, and basically, I was just screwed. Luckily I did get a refund, but the disappointing look on my granddaughter's face was heartbreaking. This was her first time flying, and she was so excited. Not to mention the amount of money spent prepping for this trip! All just a waste! I will NEVER fly Spirit again. Pay the extra money and fly Delta - it will save you the headache",-1

My Saturday flight was canceled from Honduras to Houston. I flew to Houston on Sunday to find out my Houston flight to Los Angeles was canceled as well. They booked us on a Monday flight that got canceled as well. I had to pay for a hotel room for Saturday in Honduras, Sunday and Monday in Houston. I had to purchase airline tickets with United. Booking a trip with spirit cost me an additional $1300 plus the $1600 I had already paid them to fly with them. Every time you have a problem when you call them and it takes hours to speak with a representative and when they answer they can’t help you. The employees are not willing and able to help you with anything. This airline shouldn’t even exist period. I was supposed to get home on Saturday and now I’m getting home Tuesday with a different airline. My kids are missing school 2 days my husband and I are missing work for 2 days as well.",-1

Got to airport the night before. Went through security and going to sleep at gate just to have flight canceled again. They just claim the flight was disrupted. Every other airline was running no problems. Just run away as fast as possible and go with a real company. They deserve negative stars.,-1
2022-04-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Seattle,2.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled via email one hour before my flight,True,"  If you like wasting your time and having an awful day at the airport, book with Spirit. There is no spirit agent in site, they are literally there only in spirit. I found out my flight was cancelled via email one hour before my flight. Since there are no agents you scan a QR code to try to either rebook or get a refund, so you basically have to scramble to find another way home. No big, it’s not like I have a job, maybe Spirit will hire me so I can work from home and do nothing. Don’t book with them, I should have known better by seeing the one star they currently have but don’t deserve. Paying the extra for another airline is worth it. If not bring a butt pillow or sleeping bag since you’ll be sitting for a whole day at the airport.",-1
2022-04-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Milwaukee,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Zero regard for customers,False,"  Horrible, will never fly with them again and will let everyone know not to fly with them. We had flights cancelled twice due to “weather.” They put us up in the shadiest hotel I ever stayed in, no towels, blankets or TV and it was filthy. I can’t believe I stayed there, but we had no choice, no other place to stay and we just paid 50 bucks for a taxi. Some employees were extremely rude and unhelpful. Zero regard for customers. We were offered flights several days later, but most of us had to work, let alone paying for additional hotels, meals, car, etc. The computer system locked up and many of us were in line for hours on end. They gave us no choice but to rent a car at our own expense and drive 20 hours home. I would guess because of Spirit we will spend an additional 1500 dollars and now miss a day of work. Spirit needs to be reviewed by whomever the airlines certification/governing board is and shut them down. There is no way they should be running a business that people invest their hard earned money into. Very sad situation!",-1
2022-04-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,airline is a complete disaster,False,"  After reading lots of reviews of the airline I was pretty skeptical. I wondered if there are a lot of malcontents in the world. However, all of the negative reviews were spot on. This airline is a complete disaster. The reviews say that approximately one third of those who reviewed this airline will never fly them again. I have just joined the 33 percent. It was a horrific experience. A direct flight from Louisville, KY to Ft. Lauderdale, FL was to leave at 6:20 pm and land in Florida at 9:30 pm. At 6:15pm there was no plane at the gate and no attendant at the gate. It wasn’t until around 7:00 pm that someone finally showed up at the gate saying that the flight was delayed and it would be ready to board around 9:45 pm. The was no notification on the website that the flight would be delayed. So, after several other instances, the flight actually did not take off until after midnight and it finally landed in Ft. Lauderdale at 2:40 am. It took till at least 3:30 am to get your bags and there were virtually no rental cars. At 5:15 am I was finally able to get a car and I arrived at my destination around 8:15 am with no sleep. The part that angers passengers is that they knew there was no way that a plane from their airline was going to be in Louisville at 6:20 pm and they didn’t let anyone know. You were stuck and there was nothing that you could do. The flight attendants near the gate were whooping it up having a great time while everyone sat by in amazement. My return flight was a few days later and you figured that it couldn’t happen again, however it did just not as bad. The return flight was to depart at 3:20 pm and arrive at 5:30, however I got to Louisville around 8pm. This time they had a plane at the gate just not enough flight attendants. It took them about 2 hours to get one. This airline is a true clown show. They don’t care and it’s so obvious. There’s a whole lot more that I could add about how truly inept this airline is, however I guess I knew that before I booked the trip and won’t make that mistake again.",-1

While at the Orlando Airport no one was working at the Spirit check in counter. Therefore Spirit was no help at all at the Orlando Airport. So we then called there customer service number, waited over a hour on the phone, no answer. Had to rent a car and drive back home. Tried to call Spirit customer service numerous times over the past 3 days, to at least get our canceled flight money back, again no answer. Had to finally call our credit card company to cancel Spirits numerus charges for the canceled flight, luggage and check-in charges etc. They obviously could care less about me and my wife and the long line of customers they screwed over.",-1

My flight on April 1 from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago was cancelled and I stood in line at airport for hours to rebook my flight to only hear that they will offer a flight on April 5 otherwise, I am on my own. I had my 72 years old mother, my wife and 4 young children with me. This was at 11pm, we weren’t able to find available hotels or rental cars, everything was sold out. all my attempts to speak with customer service agents at the airport and on the phone failed, they offered no help what so ever. Absolutely useless and disrespectful to any human being. We slept at the airport on the ground, then took a taxi the next day to Miami to find a rental car and had to drive back to Chicago. The drive took two days. We had the worst time ever. They spoiled all the fun we had on the Cruise. Everyone arrived home super sick. All my friends that traveled on other airlines were able to rebook on the same day or within the next 12 hours while spirit airlines did absolutely nothing to its customers. Do not fly on this airline regardless of the cost. It is a complete disaster and the most mismanaged company in the world.",-1

The flight was an hour late on the way to Las Vegas from Minneapolis. When they served refreshments the cheese was fully warm not cooled - was overpriced and the cheapest brand you can get plus the flight was very wobbly and unstable for a flight with 0 bad weather. Then our flight back from Las Vegas is canceled last minute with 0 notification, not even an email. Waited in line 1.5 hours to get told we wouldn't have a flight for a couple of days. We now have to drive from Las Vegas to Minnesota and spend tons more money because of there unreliability. Never flying with Spirit ever again.",-1

We were supposed to board at 8:30, and when time comes around spirit has made no announcements. About 30 mins later at 9 an employee says that they are delayed and waiting on flight crew to arrive. We were already getting worried since we had a closely timed connecting flight, however they reassured us that we were going to be good. They delayed by 30 mins once again. 30 mins is up then its 2 hours so it's now at 11:30. We were stressed out about our connecting flight and weren't receiving any help from staff. Then the lady spoke and said that for anyone going to Michigan, this plane will land in Atlanta and you will take the same plane all the way to Detroit. So we felt better and some of the flight crew decided to show up, so an hour and a half passes once again and finally it seemed like we were good to go. They said we will be boarding the plane in just a few moments. Another 30 mins goes by and then they finally decide to tell us that anyone going to Detroit cannot fly. So we are trying to figure out what's going on since they just told us we could fly the same plane all the way there. Then they responded with your connected flight was canceled. Makes zero sense! They told us we have two options stay in Fort Lauderdale till next available flight. Or take the flight to Atlanta and hope for a connecting flight to come in the next few days. Either way they made it very clear they will not give any money towards hotel or stay, even though they caused us to have to stay a few more days. In addition we were told to go get our luggage from terminal three. Then that changed to terminal 4 carousel 2, terminal 3 carousel 4, and finally terminal 4 and carousel 4 which they were finally right about. We spent 8 hours in total waiting for the spirit flight itself just for it to be canceled. Then wait another hour for luggage and then another 2 hours for spirit rebooking services. Worst airline ever and I've never had such a terrible experience in my life. Now we are stuck in Florida without a plan and are hoping to make it back home by Monday. The best part about all of this is before going on spirit I told myself I would never just from what I heard. However, with such a cheap flight I was hoping it would pay off and of course not even close. Ended up spending a lot more money then saved, since we we're staying a few extra nights and having to book another flight.",-1

First, they cancel the flight (8am flight). They rebook you the next day. We had paid for seats - but they wouldn't allow us to check-in or choose seats until the following day. Still unsure if we can even get on the plane. Support said 'it looks full so you just need to go to the airport to see if you can get on.' Truly unreal how pathetic these people are.",-1

We have booked rooms in New Jersey, tickets to the New York game as well as tickets to the indoor water park at American dream everything is a complete list. We arrive at the Atlanta airport to check in to find out our flights were delayed, a hour or so goes by they announced over the intercom that our entire flight has been canceled with no explanation as to why. They gave us 3 options- refund, rebook for a later date or flight credit. We chose rebook for next day. The next day gets here and 2 hours before it’s time for us to check in I received and email that Spirit has canceled our flights yet again. This is insane, I will never in life fly with Spirit again and I feel that they should compensate us in some type of way.",-1
2022-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Las Vegas to Detroit via Newark,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3.0,fly a more reliable carrier,True,"  Las Vegas to Detroit via Newark. Be warned in advance. This is the 2nd time we booked with Spirit and it has been a nightmare both times. We canceled our 1st flight because 1 month before our trip took place in 2020, the airlines changed our direct 2-hour flight to a connecting flight with a 12-hour layover! We booked 3 months in advance. After that, I said I would never fly with Spirit again but we planned a trip to Vegas for my daughter's birthday. We flew Frontier (which was great) to Vegas. Our return flight with Spirit forced us to have an 18-hour layover in Newark NY and a connecting fly out the next day in LaGuardia! I booked a hotel in LaGuardia to be comfortable which the hotel charged my cc $200 for a no-show due to the flight cancellation. Spirit sends a cancellation notice the day of our departure and provides no remedy. We were forced to stay and pay for two extra hotel days totaling $316, purchase 2 new one-way tickets home at $500 each, and charged a $200 no show fee from the hotel we no longer needed since our new reservations had no layovers. I will never ever fly Spirit again. Sometimes the more feasible price is the biggest headache. Trust me, save yourself the unnecessary stress and fly with a more reliable carrier.",-1

2022-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,zero communication,False," Orlando to Columbus. Worst airline I've ever flown with. We originally had a flight planned for takeoff at 11:00 a.m. and were supposed to begin boarding at 10:15 a.m. We waited until about 11:00 a.m. (keep in mind that the plane wasn't even at the terminal yet) until we understood why our flight was late. Finally, a spirit worker came on over the loudspeaker and explained our flight was running late but we should be on track soon. No big deal, right? Well, fast forward to about 11:30, our plane FINALLY shows up at the terminal. We began boarding as usual, which was extremely complicated considering we had to change our gate THREE times to finally be able to board. As we made our way to our seats, they went over the same introduction all airlines do, and we all sat there waiting. The plane made its way to the runway and just sat there for about 30 minutes not moving. No information was given to us as passengers as to why our flight was an hour delayed from of original departure time, and finally, we were told that our plane was unable to take off at the time. We made our way back to the gate and were given the option to either stay on the plane or hang out inside the airport until our new takeoff time, 2:00 p.m. So we waited on the plane for about fifteen minutes, and then were told all passengers were required to deboard. We left the plane, being told that our flight would be delayed for approximately an hour. Again, we were all just happy that we had a flight. Hours passed (more than two) and no update was given to us about our ""delay"". FINALLY, we were given the information that our flight had been cancelled, far too long after our departure time. Yet no announcement was even made about the cancellation. It was only when I walked passed the flight agenda board that I saw my flight cancellation. Complete waste of time and zero communication between Spirit and its passengers. The cherry on top would be the unfriendly flight crew. Unless you want a flight full of miscommunications, confusing changes, and unreliability, DO NOT fly with Spirit Airlines!!",-1

2022-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Indiapolis,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,Never flying Spirit Airlines again,False,  First we had to wake up very early to go to the Orlando airport which was cold and rainy at around 7:00am. After we got there everything went smoothly and we would heading to boarding. We boarded the plane on time and everything looked good. But then we hit “airport rush hour” which means a lot of plane traffic basically. We waited 10 minutes for this to pass. Then the pilot said we had a engine failure so we went back to the gate. Then after having are flight delayed 3 times they canceled it saying it was “because of weather” but there was no major storms in the usa. So they lied to our faces. After that we had to wait in a long line to find out a possible flight. After waiting 2-3 hours we found out the next spirit flight was on Monday. And so we checked for other flight but there were none. They also said they only did the un used portion of the refund so about half. As well as no hotels and cars to provide you or no deals for your next flight. We ended up having to spend even more money to get a car as we decided to drive home. Never flying Spirit Airlines again.,-1
2022-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Tampa,,,,,,1.0,1.0,we finally hear Flight cancelled,True,"  Let me start from the beginning of the play. Searching the web for the best “deal” I can get I stumble across Spirit Airlines: $158.00, that was almost $200 less than my “go to” carrier. I call the number…my fingers quivering with delight. The phone rings and a gentleman answers. He is not a Spirit employee but he handles my query quite professionally. He tells me the rate and I think to myself this is to good to be true. So I ask him what about luggage fee and he says $40.00!  All is good I receive the E ticket as promised.  I get to Milwaukee’s airport and there is a very short line. I am delighted with Spirit. I am ready to check my bag in at the counter when this lady offers to help me at the kiosk to check in my bag and pulls up the price: $78.00. I am stunned an exclaim “this just isn’t right”. The gentleman who took “care if me quoted $40.00. Then the lady says if you went online you would have been able to get the bag checked for $50.00. I begrudgingly fork over the dough.  It is 2:00 o clock and the flight doesn’t start boarding until 3:25 with take off scheduled at 4:10.  I get to the gate on time and wait quietly people watching. Time goes bye and I notice it was boarding time but no Spirit rep was at the gate. Then I notice the big Spirit light display saying “Flight delayed 5:15. So a little delay isn't going to hurt anyone. At 5:15 there is a couple of representatives. They haven't made an announcement yet, they both disappear and then the Spirit light flashes 6:10.  After another two hours we finally hear “Flight cancelled”. 8:15 pm. No explanation.",-1

We had a flight booked with them for 16 people and they canceled 3 hours before the flight. We had already driven to Vegas from Salt Lake and were stuck.

Waited 3 more hours, and then they told us it was cancelled and we need to see our options for rebooking, only to tell us that they don’t have a open flight for the next 4 days.

2022-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is a terrible airline,True,"  I would give Spirit Airlines 0/10 rating. I booked my flight from Tampa to Chicago months ago (before gas prices skyrocketed). I get to the airport on time, go through security, and get to my gate and wait. 3 announcements were made that our plane has arrived but needs to be cleaned, it’ll be ready in 15-20 mins. After over an hour the final announcement made was the flight was canceled. The weather was fine because other flights went out and the later Spirit flights were still scheduled to continue. Our only option was to receive a refund because the next flight available was in 5 days. Yea, sure, refund me the amount of money I spent months ago so that I have to pay way more to book a new flight with a new airline with ticket prices for today and not months ago. The reason my flight was canceled by the way, they had no crew for it! Spirit was no help in resolving their cancellation and I would not recommend them to anyone! Sure the prices are cheap but that’s because you pay for everything else like a carry one that is normally included with most airlines. No entertainment on the plane, good thing I downloaded some stuff from Netflix on my IPad, and $3.50 for a can of pop that used to be complimentary with other airlines. Spirit is a terrible airline, buyer beware!",-1
2022-04-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines ruined my vacation,True," Spirit Airlines ruined my vacation. My family and I were excited to go on our first cruise since the start of COVID. We usually fly Delta, but since we were flying across the country, I thought I would try saving a few dollars and fly with Spirit. I understood the nickel and dime approach for everything from seat selection to snacks, but we were taking a late flight and would probably be sleeping most of the trip. After planning and preparing (my sinuses are still sore from the mandatory covid test required by the cruise line), we arrived at the gate and waited. After the listed boarding time passed, passengers began asking when we would board. There were rumors that the co-pilot had not arrived. Shortly, we were informed that the flight was canceled and we would have to be rebooked. Only there were no other flights that night or the next day. Consequently we could not get a flight to make our cruise and we missed it. Because it was less than 48 hours, I was not eligible for a refund or cruise credit. Spirit did refund my airline tickets, but that was only a fraction of what was lost. Because of my work schedule and my kids's school schedules, this was our only opportunity for a cruise this year. I will never consider Spirit Airlines again for any flight.",-1

Booked a trip from Philadelphia to San Juan, Puerto Rico. My original flight was from 07.30 to 11.30. At 04.40, I received an email from Spirit to alert me of the flight change to 08.30 to 12.30. Then at 05.30, I received another email to inform me that my flight was canceled. I didn’t realize there was a change as many other customers until we were already at the airport checking in bags. I paid for flight, paid for bags, paid for seats, paid for hotel and the was for three people. Thanks to Spirit, I am sitting here trying to figure out what to do with my family. I live in Southern California and flew to Philly for vacation. Now trying to salvage my time away from home. This hurts so much as I am not rich and spent my hard earned money trying to show my family a good time. This is the first time in my life I am taking a vacation and look what happened.

They do not value their customers, it is just a business to them and have “policies” in place that prevent any accommodations for you as a result of their mistakes. You can look at this entire list of reviews and see that. I had a trip to Mexico planned. My flight was then changed close to my departure date (randomly) to completely different days - obviously that does not work when you are planning a vacation. They had no flights available at all for my original return date all of a sudden. The new departure date was cheaper than my original and they denied the ability to just pay me the difference. I canceled my flights all together, was given a refund and paid for the cheaper new flight myself…thinking let me give Spirit another shot. Horrible mistake because Guess what? My flight was changed again to a time that hindered my vacation. Only this time “it is policy” that no one can offer me a refund (even supervisors) because it was a 50 minute difference instead of 60 minutes. So just forget you if you have somewhere to be! Do not use them. Go with JetBlue, United, American or somebody. But Spirit will ruin your vacation. You deserve better. We all do.",-1

2022-03-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Stay far far away,True,"  Yesterday I missed a flight due to the agent at the bag counter. Our plane was due to depart in 40 minutes and she refused to take our bags stating we were “late”. We would have made the flight. She rudely told me I have to be at the airport three hours prior to flight. I had to get a hotel, pay to rebook $200 and I missed work and had to pay extra to now take a bus because I did not have a ride for today. Today we arrived at 245… their employee did not arrive at the counter until 330. (How about that arriving three hours prior to the flight?) There is a long line and the plane boarded in an hour (which apparently their staff will refuse to take bags) The first day they made us miss our flight they told us to call Customer service to which we did. I chatted with an online agent who stated their employee was in the wrong. They told us we could file a formal complaint online and they would get back to us in 30 days. They would not resolve my issue that day. They charged us $200 to rebook, threatened to charge $260 for a “no show” if we didn’t rebook with them  (we were there and were refused service). If we didn’t have bags it would’ve saved us over $1000 (rebook, hotel, Lyft, bus ticket, missed day of work). Never again flying a budget airline and never again spirit. I have filed two formal complaints. Our flight was overbooked which is likely why she refused to take our bags. Because the same person who refused to take our bags that day came in late the next day and took our bags at the same time she refused them the day prior. So I guess it’s a double standard?  When calling for boarding they were rude stating “hurry up let’s go” over the intercom while their was a long line boarding. Hurry up and get in line to be mistreated by unprofessional staff.  I spoke with spirit and they literally did not care and then acted as if it was an act of god that they gave me a measly $50 voucher to fly with them again before June.  Stay far far away.",-1

Carry on cost more then a checked bag. A few hours before we are to leave our flight is cancelled. When arriving to the airport to see an alternative route back home I was sent to Cleveland. Where again there was no additional flight home. I was told that there would be. I was dropped off to an airport that was 7 hours from home with no other way to get home but the following day. For personal reasons I was not able to leave the next day, I needed to leave that day when I booked my ticket back in February 2022. So with no other choice I had to get a rental car and get myself home. again, 7 hours from home and all they gave me was a $50 voucher that certainly did not cover the cost of a rental.

Upon boarding, the seats are bunched in together and very uncomfortable. I ask the flight attendant if there were any items they had to make the seat more comfortable and she said no. To my surprise, I’m used to being able to watch a movie while in flight. To my surprise, I was not able to. On top of this, I had to pay for internet service to stream movies in my phone. Along with this, no snacks were offered. We had to pay for everything, even a cup of water. I fly JetBlue and everything is included. Of course if I want extra, there is an additional cost but at least something is offered on the flight. The flight home was no different except that the flight once again was delayed twice (30 minutes and then 15 minutes). Then we were delayed a 3rd time on the runway. This was the first and will be the last time I fly spirit airlines. It was a very disappointing experience. Along with this, I was never told that the combined weight of the luggage is taken to determine extra charges.

Two months (March 2022) after my flight, I finally get an email regarding my incident (January 2022). Still, no resolution or compensation. Spirit’s app can at any time (which is all the time) experience 'tech difficulties' and the bag you paid for can be refunded without your knowledge. At the gate, you will be charged the max (75) for a bag you already paid for (refund in 3-5 bus. days). Spirit will not compensate you in any way. Also, if you have a connecting flight, the agents at the desk are not trained to continue your bags, thus you will pay twice for a bag you already paid for. The customer service agent does not care about your boarding pass that says yes near carry-on if their system says “no” due to their own wrongdoing. I personally would rather push a vehicle from DC to LA before standing in a Spirit terminal. Zero across the board. The only reason I gave a 1/10 is because I got where I needed to be. Never again. And if you’re reading this, you can’t buy peace of mind. The “cheap” prices of Spirit come with the hefty price or lack of peace of mind.",-1

Seats are completely uncomfortable, the charge for carry on and check, they practice price gouging, and many other negatives, but today will be my last time ever flying with them. There was a lady with two little boys and girl, had one checked in luggage. Even though they charged her ridiculously, still they made her take 4 pounds out of the luggage as it exceeded 40 lb, all airlines check in is 50 lb and they charge half, second: 4lb wow, let the lady keep them instead of carrying them on top of her kids stuff, her backpack etc..",-1

The Detroit Gate staff were rude, displaying unnecessary authority and unprofessional behavior! It is not like we paid for discounted seats, we actually paid more for these seats than we would have paid for in Delta or AA or any other reputed airlines! They have rules that no other airlines have, basically to squeeze every penny they can get away with from passengers!  They charged us $83 for a personal item, when it fully fit into the container with the handle sticking out. They claimed nothing should be sticking out! Just another excuse to suck money from people. We were heading to Miami to celebrate our 29th Anniversary and it just spoiled the rest of our day! Customer dis-service!  They don’t serve as much as a glass of water, you have to pay $3.50 for a bottle of water. Seats don’t recline, they are hard and not very clean.",-1

A group of us flew to Nashville to celebrate my engagement. They didn’t load our bags because the smoke alarm wasn’t working. Our bags didn’t arrive until the next night. We only had 2 full days in Nashville since they delayed our flight the first day and left on the 4th day. We had to buy new clothes, wasted a night because of the delay and everywhere was closed in Nashville because we had arrived so late. Had no carry on bags because we weren’t allowed any and Spirit did absolutely nothing to make up for any of it. We submitted our claims to get reimbursed for necessities we had to buy and they are making it a literal obstacle course to get any kind of reimbursement. Receipts submitted and even had to enter individual items on the receipts per person. We had to go out and buy essentials like toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc and even clothes because all we had was the clothes we flew on. I have never flown with such a disgraceful, uncaring airline. We will never ever fly with Spirit again because it’s honestly a poor company to fly with. No customer service at all.",-1

It had us leaving for a city too far for us to drive. I called within 5 minutes, they changed my flight back to the city and charged me $158.00 dollars more making it more than other flights.

Our redeye flight was delayed 15 hours overnight. We eventually got through to the Escalation Office and were granted one hotel room for the 8 of us. After speaking with Spirit about further flight delays and miscommunications, we were then granted 2x $50 vouchers each, totaling $800. For the last 6 months I have attempted to apply those vouchers to flights - I have tried several destinations, at various times throughout the year, and always receive an error message. I have spoken with and emailed countless customer service agents who provided no assistance at all. Finally one customer service agent explained the vouchers are essentially useless and will never actually work. Very disappointed that Spirit would be so deceptive and issue fraudulent useless vouchers. Hopefully others will contact Spirit and let them know this is no acceptable - join with me in demanding honest customer service!",-1
2022-03-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Pensacola,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,completely unorganized and chaotic,True,"  On Friday the 18th, my family and I completed the early check-in on Spirit’s app for our flight scheduled Saturday the 19th. We arrived at the Orlando airport 3 hours in advance. It was packed, the lines were very long, and it was apparent that Spirit employees were understaffed. I told a Spirit employee that the lines were moving incredibly slow, and I was afraid that my family and I were going to miss our flight. This one and only kind Spirit employee quickly checked our 1 suitcase in, and we went straight to the security check-in. It was packed there as well. Tons of other passengers were afraid they too were going to miss their flights, which we later found out they did. We spent a total of 3 hours checking in due to understaffing! We then hopped on the airport shuttle, which took us to our gate. I asked 3 employees to please alert our gate (gate# 26) that we were on our way. They denied our request. In fact, they said, “To be honest, you’re probably not going to make your flight.” And did absolutely nothing to help rectify the situation. If Spirit knew that we probably were not going to make our flight, then they should not have even checked our suitcase in. The whole Spirit experience was completely unorganized and chaotic. As passengers, we were proactive and did absolutely everything that we could & should have done to make our flight, but due to the limited Spirit staff, the whole process was delayed (took 3 hours) and caused us to miss our flight. Due to this poor operation, we had to pay 1 additional day for our dogs’ boarding ($60) and pay 1 additional day at a hotel ($250). Spirit Airlines completely dropped the ball, and all of the Spirit employees at the Orlando airport (except for the 1 employee) were not helpful. The comments we received (with a sarcastic and negative tone) were, “Well, what can I do?”, and “Well, sorry. The gate is closed. Nope, the gate just now closed.” The Spirit employees had zero care, zero compassion, zero understanding, zero willingness to help, and provided zero options. If I were the CEO of Spirit, I would be downright embarrassed by the way these employees represented Spirit. To top off the horrible experience, the 3 supervisors took zero accountability, and did nothing to accommodate the horrendous experience. I wouldn’t want anyone else to ever endure the awful experience we had with Spirit in our efforts to return home.",-1

After multiple delays, we left the airport at 11.30pm after flight was cancelled, aircraft was available but no crew. Stayed on the phone over an hour to rebook, did not have anything for Sunday, so delayed until Monday 3/21. Flight already showing delayed at 10.00am, and already received 4 more updates so flight is now following same pattern as last Saturday. Decided to cancel this trip as I am not letting this airline ruin my family vacation, booked with Southwest instead. Will never fly Spirit again and will make sure I tell all my friends and family about how bad this airline is, I will spare you the details of their customer service and their airport crew. Anyway if you have to fly don't even think about this airline, it seems like a good idea as the price is low, but you will just be ruining your travel plans once its either delayed or cancelled.",-1

I paid the 60.00 carry-on bag fee with his ticket, but when he arrived at the gate, the Spirit representatives would not let him on the flight. They made him pay the 60.00 again before he would be allowed on the flight. So my son hands over the only cash he has (money I gave him so he could buy food on his trip) to an angry woman working for Spirit airlines because ""unless you pay, we are closing this gate and leaving without you"".

Flights are, without fail, always delayed, or simply canceled, we are never given space for the carry-ons we paid for ahead of time, and the flights are always oversold. I understand the need for efficient travel, but asking time and again for people to get off the flight is super rude and completely disregards the time, patience, and needs of travelers. I will be signing up for a Delta credit card and using them exclusively in the future, as they have never treated me or my husband as poorly as Spirit has on our last 5 flights with them.",-1

They get you in luggage. I bought 1 checked bag when buying round trip flights which was $47. I get to my destination great but on the way back the airlines said I did not buy a bag for the way back so I had to pay an extra $73 dollars. My tickets was $150 and $197 with baggage. Not horrible but having to buy an extra bag for little less then double from the first flight is really ridiculous. So yeah cheap flight of $270 dollars for a 4 day trip but I find it extremely ridiculous that I had to spend that much on luggage. I could have gone to a different airline and paid less without having to worry about paying for my bag. They need to fix their website for buying luggage.,-1

Our flight was scheduled for Friday evening and the best they could do was to get us on the next flight on Tuesday at 9:50pm, arriving at LAX at midnight on Wednesday morning. Four full days would have been lost on our 8 day vacation. They would not assist with other airlines or provide any assistance, other than a refund. The reason for the cancellation was ""weather related"" however, there was no weather in the area of take off or in the direction we were heading (west). Other airlines in STL we continuing with their flights without interruption. This was our first, and likely last experience with Spirit.",-1

Each time I say I’ll never do it again. This time I mean it. Absolutely awful! Supposed to board at 6.40pm. We were delayed over an hour because they were waiting on a crew member. That’s ridiculous. Then we begin boarding at 7.45. We are already on board when they make us exit the plane because the pilot is in Denver! How do you not know your pilot is half way across the country before you have us board the plane? Never. Ever. Again.,-1
2022-03-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,There will be no next flight with Spirit,True," Not worth the savings. There is mass confusion at two gates. Flight staff coming off of two side by side gates are saying the flights are switched. Flight information displayed at the gates is, apparently, wrong. There is not an airline representative in sight. I could overlook it if we didn’t all stand in line for 60 minutes to drop checked bags with only one worker for 2 Spirit flights (that did not start providing service into 1.5 hours before boarding time). Don’t plan on checking a bag? Ok. But you should know it is way more expensive at the gate - and even closer to the flight date. My husband prepared and paid for our bags to be checked a month in advance. Sweet savings! Except that when I checked us in for our flight it did not show us having any bags - so I paid for 4 carry-ons (less expensive than checked at this point - $204 total to be exact). More than what we thought initially - but fine. Until my husband found his payment confirmation and we realized we had paid twice. Sure enough 1 bag checked and 1 bag carry on were shown as being purchased per person (we only had 1 a piece). He called to rectify the mistake only to be told that bags are a non-refundable service - but we could credit it to our next flight. There will be no next flight with Spirit. We are still at the gate 30 minutes after we were supposed to take off with no information/updates and incorrect gate information. It still shows ‘on time’. I wish I had listened to the poor reviews.",-1
2022-03-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,just pay for a better flight,True,"  Spirit Airlines held the plane after landing in Orlando for so long that everyone missed their next connecting flight. My friends and I are all 22 with no adult and were alone and the Spirit workers could have cared less actually. The only thing they did to “help” was to refund us (which they said we still don’t know if we can do that) or give us another flight two days later with no hotel and no food accommodations what so ever. We ended up having to buy another ticket via Delta for about $700 just to get home in time for all of us to make class on Monday. They were rude, yelled at us and said “have any of y’all never missed a flight before?” Also on the flight to Orlando (came from Dominican Republic) I paid $51 for a seat up front (3C) so that I could get off the plane quickly to make my connecting flight and they completely didn’t care and printed my boarding pass with the seats 16 D. After I showed them my bill for $51 and my seat confirmation for 3C they proceeded to tell me “Sorry we actually have no control over that. If someone tries to argue with you about your seat you’ll just have to figure it out with that person” So, save yourself time and money and just pay for a better flight to begin with such as Delta. They were amazing and even gave all of my friends and I a toiletry bag for free AND waived our bag fee for us. After this trip I will only fly Delta.",-1

Respect, I paid for flights that they think is ok to change, people work and plan accordingly. We normally fly a different airline but they have now merged so you don't get a choice.

Why provide kiosks to print boarding passes and luggage tags, if you have to wait 1 hour to turn checked in luggage in? After half the plane missed the flight because their outrageous lack of will to help departing flights, they offered to rebook us 3 days later.

Flight to Vegas was uneventful, but I had received an email the day prior asking if I had flexible travel plans and wanted to change my flight. I declined as I had specific plans. On my return flight, received the same email 12 hours prior. Also had arranged a ride from the airport and could not be changed. Got to the airport the usual 2 hours early and saw that the flight had been canceled. Called the customer service number and they said that they had emailed me to tell me the flight was canceled that happened to come as I was on my way to the airport. Less than 2 hours before departure. They offered a return flight 4 days from the date, which was entirely unacceptable and just apologized for the inconvenience. No solution offered. I ended up flying from Las Vegas to San Francisco on American , then running through the airport to catch a connector flight from San Francisco to Detroit. I was traveling for 18 hours instead of the less than 4 hour flight. I was offered a refund the morning of the cancelation, but when I called the next day, they said all they could give me was a credit for half of the round trip instead of the whole flight.

My family of 4 flew from Milwaukee direct to Phoenix. Somehow only 2 of our 3 pieces of luggage arrived at Phoenix. 5 days later the missing suitcase still has not been located. Then my return flight got canceled 12 hours before departure with NO explanation as to why. I spent $1,427 for round trip tickets, bags, and upgraded seats. They claim I'll get a $488 credit for the canceled return flight but I haven't seen the credit yet. That's really bad math considering they only did half of the job. They never offered a solution and I had to scramble to get a return flight for $667 on a different airline to get home. Terrible communication and terrible customer service.

This was my first time flying Spirit Airlines and I assure you it will be my last. Both flights to and from Tampa were over an hour delayed because we were waiting on the pilots. They boarded us an hour before we actually departed so instead of waiting in the airport where we could stretch out, they crammed us onto the plane to just sit there for an hour waiting to depart. Very frustrating that this happened on both flights. Will never fly with them again. Also, no wifi options. They charge for all snacks.",-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Myers to Minneapolis–Saint Paul,,,,,,1.0,1.0,A horrible experience,False,  Spirit canceled our flight within nine hours of taking off. Then they charged us for rebooking. A horrible experience. I will never use spirit again.,-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Miami,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no customer service at all,True,"  Horrible. Spirit canceled my flight literally 3 mins before boarding time. And the next available flight they could provide is 4 days later - ridiculous. Caused me to spend additional $1100 because now I have to stay over night at a hotel till my next now United flight the following day and miss a whole work day. Very frustrating and no customer service at all, no assistance, no one cares for you.",-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Miami,,,,,,,1.0,canceled the flight at the last minute,False,"  I'll echo what other reviewers have emphasized. The airline canceled the flight at the last minute, booked us on a 1:00 AM flight the next day, and did not have anybody at customer service to answer the phones. We waited for almost an hour, only to be transferred to a customer service survey. It might be the cheapest on Expedia, but unless you want to risk all of your plans flying this airline, don't use it to save the few extra dollars. Buying the cheapest on Expedia only encourages pathetic performance.",-1
2022-03-13,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Horrible customer service,True,  Do not Fly Spirit Airlines! The past 3 vacations have been ruined by this airline because they have cancelled our flight. Horrible customer service who could care less that you have spent months of planning only to see everything down the toilet.  How can they get away with this? I am out $4000 dollars because I chose their airline. This is wrong in so many ways.,-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,do not use this airline,False,  Our plane was delayed for 4 hours because the captain didn’t show up then we finally boarded and proceeded to get kicked off due to “maintenance issues”. I give this company 0 stars and would not recommend to anyone traveling due to their inconveniences and inconsiderate attitudes. The Spirit flight attendants are so slow and have no sense of urgency to help guide us. If you’re flying 100% do not use this airline.,-1
2022-03-13,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,This airline is not punctual,False,  This airline is not punctual. Do not trust Spirit Airlines to get you anywhere on time. It does not care about its customers. It is better to spend more money with an airline company that will get you to your destination on time and that offers adequate leg room and quality customer care.,-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Dallas to Chicago,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,The cheapest is not always the best,False,"  Stay away from Spirit Airlines, if at all possible. They charge for everything and is hardly ever on-time with arrivals and departures. The last flight was delayed by over two hours on short notice and for an unknown reason(s). I have never taken a flight with Spirit Airlines that was on-time getting me to my destination. It does not award or reimburse one for the inconvenience. The cheapest is not always the best. If one wants to receive quality customer service and get to his destination on-time, it pays to use a better quality airline company, even if it costs more.",-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Los Angeles via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,They absolutely do not care about their passengers!,True," We don’t receive any email confirming our flight and what the luggage policy is, we get to the airport and have to pay a fortune for each bag and on each connecting flight! A fortune with very impolite staff. Worst is yet to come. For the flight back from Dominican Republic with a connection in Fort Lauderdale, there’s a 4 hour delay (minimum,  we are still waiting!). We won’t make it for our connection to LAX and there’s no more flights today. Solution from Spirit: none! “Do you want a reimbursement?” Yeah sure…we want to be stuck in PUJ with our 2 kids! Looks like we will be stuck in Fort Lauderdale with our kids for the night and no hotel! And for those who ask why we fly with Spirit (first and last time) we didn’t choose. I strongly recommend not to fly with Spirit especially if you have kids! They absolutely do not care about their passengers! Only solution: we reimburse. Yep, but you’re stuck in a foreign country.",-1
2022-03-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianpolis to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst airline in America,True," Worst airline in America. Charge you for everything. You pay for a ticket yet a seat isn’t included in your ticket, you have to pay extra for that. You wanna check in? $20. Literally will charge you for anything other than a backpack. Had a fragile tag on my bag and it was literally thrown it on the belt right in front of me. Writing this currently sitting in the airport with a two hour delay that “I wouldn’t understand” according to the Spirit staff at the desk.",-1
2022-03-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Hartford,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit is the bare bottom of airlines,True," Don't do it! You're going to be tempted because they are cheap, but I implore you to resist their low-cost charms. Their ""customer service"" representatives are well trained in avoidance and ambivalence, and they simply do not care. Today marks the second cancelled flight that I've booked with Spirit only to have them cancelled at the last minute. The vouchers given for the first cancelled flight were for $50.00 however you can only use them on the actual cost of a flight which equates to about $4.00, literally. Spirit is the bare bottom of airlines. It doesn't get any lower. Rent a donkey, hop a train, hitchhike in the back of a sketchy pick up before you spend a cent with these con artists.",-1
2022-03-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Pittsburgh,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,1.0,They don’t have standby crews,False,"  We have used Spirit more than a few times, members in their discount club, and before the “pandemic” we had zero problems going anywhere they service. We understand that spirit is a low cost carrier and don’t have any expectations of any type of top rated service. It is what it is and we know that. NOW, when they are trying to recoup the money they lost when people were not traveling they are in a jackpot. They will schedule flights, even offer discounts, but they can’t deliver. They don’t have standby crews and when a crew times out you are pretty much screwed. It’s a crapshoot if you are going to leave on time or if you are even going to leave At all, After four days at the Tampa Hard Rock hotel/casino. March 10, Tampa to Pittsburgh, flight 280. The weather was a little cloudy and a few drops of rain at the airport. Delayed from 3:00 to 3:30. Then until 5:00. Then until 5:45. We knew what was coming next so we headed for the desk at the gate. Which BTW had been changed 3 times. Yep, on they way to the desk, just as we expected, canceled. When I asked why, the women at the desk said, “I don’t know. The air traffic control said something about a storm or something.” They canceled 7 flights that day. Talking to a family from another spirit flight I was told they were in the plane when the pilot told them that he was sorry but due to the crew being “timed out” they wouldn’t be taking off and they had to deplane. We all know things are tough and you need to make up for the loss of revenue but at least tell the people that are paying that due to lack of personnel they might be delayed or not flying at all. That “discounted” ticket cost us a hotel for 3 days until we could get home. Not such a great deal is it.",-1
2022-03-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Las Vegas via Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Customer service is probably worst I have ever seen,False,  We had a layover from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas in Philadelphia. As soon as we arrived in Philadelphia we were informed that our next flight was canceled. We went to see if we could get on another flight and they were planning on rescheduling us on the next flight that was in 3 days. Obviously that didn't work out so we had to buy a flight from another company to get home but when we requested a refund for our flight they informed us we had to call customer service. Customer service had no idea the flight was canceled and couldn't understand English enough for us to tell them the situation and that it wasn't us that canceled the flight but Spirit. And once we thought we figured it all out we found out they had lost our luggage. Customer service is probably worst I have ever seen and they are not willing to compensate for screwing you over.,-1
2022-03-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Fort Worth to Sacramento,,,,,,1.0,1.0,I lost my money for all our tickets,True,"  Actually we didn't get to fly because they wouldn't let my 2 year old be on my lap. All 7 of us were supposed to be in California for my nieces 15th birthday. I lost my money for all our tickets ($1400), my car reservation ($1200), my hotel ($350), and parking for a week. But all of that doesn't mount up to what I lost by not being able to be there for her birthday. They said I needed to buy him a ticket, which is what I was trying to do, but they didn't have one available. So they gave all our seats to some other people at full price. They gave me boarding passes for Las Vegas to Sacramento, but not Dallas to Vegas. How does that make any sense. I'm so hurt and I don't know what I can do but I will do whatever I have to do to make sure they don't do this to anyone anymore.",-1
2022-03-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst airline I have ever flown,False,"  This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown, the customer service absolutely terrible. Employees Couldn’t answer any of my questions or ignored me and there were 4 people standing there. They didn’t care about customers needs. Plane wasn’t very clean. Will never fly them again. I hope they find employees that can actually communicate. Highly recommend flying Southwest. Just thought I would give them a shot. Never again.",1
2022-03-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Minneapolis,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,True,  Worst experience ever. Had to pay $82 for my carry on and the workers were beyond rude. Spirit doesn’t care about you and just wants your money. They delayed my flight by two hours for no reason and was not professional about it. Always poor when I fly spirit but never had this level of disrespect from the workers. Never will I fly spirit again. So disappointed.,-1
2022-03-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Kansas City,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Customer Service is by far the worst,True,  Spirit Airline Customer Service is by far the worst we have ever experienced. The lack of customer service skills adds unnecessary stress to what is to suppose to be a fun family trip. They are very inconsistent on their response to the customers needs. We were charged $500 to change our tickets due to a missing flight while some other passenger that were on the same flight were not charged. Very discriminatory process and lack of explanation is unacceptable. There was over 20 people that missed the flight due to the lack of organization by Spirit Airlines. So I would strongly advice to arrive at least 6 hours early if you want to make it to your flight. If you want to flight free of stress stay away from Spirit Airlines.,-1
2022-03-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chicago via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,beyond rude and inconsiderate,True,"  Without a doubt, Spirit Airlines failed at every step of our scheduled flight. Our original flight was at 820 pm. We boarded the plane then had to get back off due to a mechanical issue. Understandable, but then the real service issues started. Each and every employee was beyond rude and inconsiderate. A true lack of professionalism in a service based position. When I asked legitimate questions, I was treated with disrespect. So we waited for the alternative flight to Fort Lauderdale that started to board around 11 pm. Our boarding pass now wouldn't work and we were told to stand to the side. Our flight from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago had already left so we were told that we would be on a flight at 645 am now. Now around midnight, we went to talk with the supervisor. She had the same attitude as all of the other employees. She would not talk with me eye to eye as she was completely dismissive of my concerns & went about what she was doing, answering my questions without an ounce of concern to my experience with Spirit. Another employee gave us vouchers for a meal & hotel accommodations that were completely worthless at the time. By the time we would have gotten to the hotel, we would of had an hour or two max before we would have to head back for our 645 am flight. Also, we would have to go back through security so it made more sense to just stay at the airport. The supervisor told me there was nothing more she could do & said I would have to call corporate for compensation for my troubles. I promptly did that and called the number I was given. After talking with that person she said she would explain my problems with her supervisor and get back to me after a minute or two. She did, then proceeded to tell me her supervisor couldn't do anything more for me than the hotel vouchers. If I wanted further compensation then I would have to now talk with a chat online. I told her that I wanted to speak with her supervisor that she just spoke with and she said that she would connect me with their line. After being on hold & waiting to talk with that supervisor for 25 minutes, I hung up in frustration that the person she just talked with immediately, would now not pick up the line I was waiting on. Now, with nothing resolved we had to stay at the airport over night. We had not eaten since 430 pm & I was traveling with my wife & 10 year old Son. Everything at the airport was now closed so we had no food or drinks all night. The situation was completely unacceptable and was handled by Spirit in a truly grotesque & unprofessional manner. I paid money for a particular value and did not receive that value. Spirit Airlines took my money for a 820 pm flight and didn't provide that flight. For certain, Spirit should have a redundancy plan to account for mechanical issues so they can provide their customers with the value that they sold, regardless of mechanical or staffing issues. In addition, I should not have to jump through hoops to relay my dissatisfaction with Spirit Airlines & be compensated for my troubles with the service provided. In a service based industry, Spirit has the responsibility to have their supervisor be capable to handle the issues, and provide an immediate reconciliation to their customers.",-1

The website said, $25 for a luggage? We didn’t have a luggage, we had a carry on. This is the first time and the last time I will use spirit.  And the Spirit Rep that were at the check-in counter, when we told them, just ignored us and told us to go, because the line needs to keep going. What? They didn’t even take the time to take care of the errors they made.",-1

2022-03-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Miami,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,2.0,never in my life fly this airline again,False,"  First off, my flight was delayed over 2 hours for absolutely no apparent reason, they never told us why. The time of departure was changed about 3 different times when I was stuck waiting in the airport. Once on the plane, the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in. I am 5 feet tall and I had a hard time spreading out in these seats, I can't imagine being any taller or larger than I am and sitting in those seats because it would have been unbearable. Also, there are no USB ports to charge any electronic devices and the tray tables are TINY. also you are charged 3.50 for water. Once arriving in FL, I get to the baggage claim to retrieve my bags and came to find out that mine and several other people's on the flight were LEFT IN BOSTON. how in the world does that happen on a direct flight??? the woman at the counter was completely apathetic and unhelpful when we were trying to figure out our next steps. The next day, I tried about 15 different times calling both the Spirit main number and the specific baggage department number. the people I spoke to from the main number basically said they could do nothing for me. I was never able to get a hold of anyone using the baggage number...it had me on hold for 25 minutes and then abruptly hung up on me 3 separate times. Finally on the second day of my trip I got a call that they would be delivering the bag to my air bnb. they said I would be called 30 mins prior. I got a call by someone telling me he was in front of my airbnb with my luggage (I was at the beach down the street, no 30 minute notice was given). The lack of communication throughout this whole process and the lack of concern from 99% of the people I spoke to from spirit was so frustrating, and I will never in my life fly this airline again.",-1

You made me wake up early to go to this flight, you delayed it so its your fault and then you want me to waste my whole day in this airport to come back where I came from?  Customer service on the phone left me hanging but a lady which I think was a manager was able to find a reasonable but still inconvenient resolution which don't get me wrong I certainly appreciate and that's why this review is not 1 star, she saved me as a customer because I was never going to flight with this airline again, but I need to go look for my luggage now -  the luggage made it to the plane, how does unaccompanied luggage get onto this flight? So I got kicked out but my luggage made it, on January I made it to California and my luggage didn't, now its the other way around. Good lord, if it wasn't for this lady I would never even consider flying with them but I'm still somewhat shocked they let this luggage go without the passenger in it, that's a serious safety issue. Try to stay away if you can unless is a stupid deal.",-1
2022-03-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never recommend this airline,False,"  Very bad service. The employees are very rude. On our way to Las Vegas the lady at the counter said we were lacking because we didn’t have our bags checked in, when my bag was under 40 pounds and they still charged me $60 dollars. Why would I pay for my baggage over the phone not knowing how much it was going to weigh? It’s posted everywhere that bags up to 40 pounds are free. Mine was under 40 and was still charged. They charged for water and snacks on the plane. They told us we couldn’t take any snacks on the plane with us. On the way back they charged me $75 for the same bag that I checked in going to Vegas no difference in weight.  I will never recommend this airline to anyone nor will I ever book this airline for myself.",-1

Every step of the way from check in to flying I had a negative experience. The check in staff made my life hell trying to check in. The staff refused to provide even the basics when asked. I asked for a garbage bag after noticing they had a giant roll of them. Instead of simply receiving the bag to hold items I otherwise couldn't hold in my hand, it turned into a yelling match with the staff in charge. It wasn't until a manager showed up that I finally received any help at all. I wish I wrote down the name of every incompetent staff member involved but I didn't have the presence of mind at the time. It was so appalling that the Spirit staff can openly show you that they don't care about you as a passenger. If you can, spend the extra money and fly with an airline company that at least pretends to care about their customers.",-1

We're not aware that Spirit Airlines change their gate and we have to take the train when we got to Sea-Tac Airport. When people who work in the counter saw us heading to the counter, they suddenly left us and closed the door of the gate. We asked the other employee why? He said, we missed the boarding time of 2:20 pm even we got there at 2:03 pm. Granting that there is 15 minutes before boarding to remind the passengers when they page, we still do have 17 minutes of time when we got there. Instead of being polite they were rude to us and blaming us that it was our fault. We're suspecting that they gave our seats to chance passenger without waiting before the boarding flight that is why they reacting like that. He also said that there is no refund missing that flight.  We just can't believe we had that bad experience that we will remember for the the rest of our life.",-1

The day before I I left I had to change leave date from Feb 19 to Feb 22 due to illness. I paid the cancellation fee bc the agent told me I had already checked in for that flight. So I couldn’t just change it (fee was more than ticket cost!) I left on Tuesday no issues, was surprised at the airport I had to pay $70 more for my suitcase which I boarded with and stowed overhead. Fast word to my return March 2. Did not receive a check in reminder 24 hours before. I used the confirmation # for my return flight (different than 1st flight) and my return flight had been cancelled. I never told the agent to ancel the return flight! So I lost the $ for that ticket as well. The supervisor offered nothing except quoting their policies. I tried to explain it was the airlines fault for cancelling the 2nd half of my trip and got no where. So then I had to buy another ticket at almost $200 just to get home.

The staff were wonderful, both flights to Ft Myers and back to Detroit were on time and great. The seats are obviously a little uncomfortable, but for a 3 hr flight it's worth it. A lot of people complain about Spirit charging for everything but here's the thing - the entire policy is online and tells you what to expect. They are a low fare airline and to keep their flight tickets low, they need to charge for everything extra. If you want to pick seats prior to checking in, you will be charged - again this is in their policy and is not hidden. I will consider flying Spirit again for my next vacation!",1

They have cheap flights but charge you for every single thing on the flight. I was not told what we could bring on and as soon we we got to the gate I was charged for two small carry-ons. Frontier was next to us and they announced what you could bring on but not Spirit. They were relentless, I had a backpack and a small carry on and my husband had one bag with him and was charged $150. Save your money and time, they hopefully will go under since customers will be sick of being charged for every petty little thing. Have to pay for beverages and a snack, wifi and your seat.

I finalized the booking and caught my mistake and called them. Even though I called as quickly as I could, no refund available. $200 in fees and a $200 ""credit"" good for only 90 days is the best they can offer.

I am currently experiencing the most horrific time flying with them and I do not recommend it to anyone. I traveled from BWI to LAS as a connecting flight to reaching San Diego. Once I arrived at LAS, this airline cancelled the entire flight and no updates or directive was given as to where to go or who to talk to. After an anxiety ridden walk around the gates and around the airport asking random airport workers where to go, I walked down to ticketing by instinct and talked to the people at the counter. Not only could I not fly out until 6 the next morning but there were absolutely no accommodations offered resulting from my need to pay for an air bnb stay right away or the Uber it costs to get there and back to the airport the next morning. I was told that due to weather, we could not receive any vouchers or accommodations. I was livid and had events I had to attend that night which I missed.  Not only that but the lack of communication and direction once it was cancelled was appalling. Like other disgruntled passengers, I was left in the cold to figure out how in the world I was to get to San Diego from a city where I knew no one. No explanation of where to pick up baggage.  It was like pulling teeth for information and I just stood there thinking “what kind of people work at this company?!” I mean seriously. I’m already exhausted from flying 6 or so hours from the opposite coast and now I must deal with sleeping arrangements, transportation, and trying to figure out when I could catch the next flight. It was borderline traumatic and panic inducing, at best.",-1

Rude staff at the boarding gate pulled me aside and made me pay $80 to check a bag that actually fit into their size display except the wheels. That was more than the price of that leg of the flight. When I complained they threatened to throw me off the flight. Then I waited more than an hour and a half before we took off. I will never fly Spirit again. Don’t fall for the low fees.

On my way to security, the Spirit representatives pulled me aside to berate me with questions and request I re-check in on the kiosk. I tried telling them I was in a hurry but they said not to worry and continued asking questions. Finally they seem satiated and look down at their watches and tell me it’s now too late, after their interference, to make the flight. My jaw literally just dropped because I couldn’t believe what they had just done. My understanding now as I have more information is that the flight was fully booked and they were offering 500$ vouchers to bump people. My presumption is, when they realized that’s the flight I was on, they deliberately made me miss it so they’d have an extra seat without having to pay out a voucher. She said she’d happily schedule me on the flight for the next day at twice the cost and no refund for the original flight. She also did not entertain my questions about local hotels or taxis and clearly did not care they had just stranded me in a foreign city. I would have gotten more enjoyment out of watching my money literally burn than dealing with spirit. They should be ashamed.",-1

Its ridiculous! And it was a ""One way flight"". This was for my nephew and had an awful experience. My sister and him had a flight yesterday from Kansas City to Vegas, was supposed to be boarded at 2.05pm even though they were suppose to take off at 2.50pm, but the plane lost all communication with tower after taxiing away from the terminal and had to sit on the plane for over 2 hours plus going nowhere. He was already nervous about flying as it was and my sister is a Diabetic and instead of offering food and juice to keep sugar levels level, they charged her for it. We got an email for a credit of $50 but expires May 2022. Really? Most airlines give you a year to use travel vouchers. Very Disappointed and will probably not book or fly Spirit Airlines again!",-1

They basically told me to get on the plane, so I did. When I got to Vegas my connecting flight was canceled and I was left with no help to find a hotel, or any reimbursement. I got an email telling me I was confirmed on another flight the next morning at 6am. When I got back to the airport at 4:30am they said I was no longer on that flight and the next available flight would be the following day! And that I would have to buy a ticket to get that flight.

The airline called us in our way to the airport and told us that the flight got canceled. I lost time from work, meaning wasted leave time, had my children with babysitter that I had to pay in advance, I lost money because we had Vegas shows and entertainment tickets bought as final deals on Groupon. Wasted money on Uber to get to the airport. The airline couldn't book another flight within 2 days. Just ruined our anniversary weekend and put my family in the impossible situation of not even being able to book a ticket with other airline, there were no last minutes tickets available for that day.

There’s about 12 of us here forced to cancel our flight and endure a nine hour flight later versus the 4.

When we leave Nashville they said it weighed 50.8 lbs and charged me $2.00 per lb ($50.00) extra. Figured take it up when return home. Leaving FL. to come back home same luggage just had dirty clothes nothing extra weighed 37.3 lbs. So how is this possible weigh your bags and have ticket so this doesn't happen to you.",-1

I have probably flown the airline 20-25 times in the last 24 months. I am now writing a review that is not very positive. I had a flight from Las Vegas to New Orleans last Friday, 2/4/22, which was 1 1/4 hours late in departing.  However, for my return flight, I was unable to check in online, with no indication as to why. I arrived at the airport 1/12 hours early on 2/8/22, and thank goodness I did. Apparently, Spirit did not have me as having boarded the aircraft when I departed on 2/4/22, and canceled my return flight. I was required to ""re-book"" my return at a cost which was nearly double what I had paid for the round trip booking. I had to provide my credit card, and was informed that I should call customer service to get it straightened out. I called the customer service line for Spirit on several occasions, and not one time has anyone even picked up the phone. When I suggested a manager at the airport assist me, I was required to provide a copy of my boarding pass from 2/4/22, and the prior reservation was re-confirmed, with the additional charge credited to my account. The entire situation was disturbing.",1

Lets start with my flight was canceled due to a snow storm on Saturday, which ok it happens. So I booked a new flight. I go to the airport the next day to fly out and I decided to talk to customer service about getting my money back for the flight they canceled. So as I tell her all I want is a refund for the flight that was canceled. She says ok, but instead of doing that goes ahead and cancels my entire flight there and back. So now I had to rebook the entire same flight and seat for the double the money all because customer service messed up. So let me say I was extremely frustrated. So lets move forward, Wednesday comes around and my girlfriend is flying home, I drop her off the airport, about an hour of her waiting for her flight and they cancel again. So now for the past 3 day days I have been going back and forth about getting a refund for my miles and money and all Spirit is doing is giving me the run away. So fed up with the company, if you can avoid flying with them do so. Just pay the extra couple bucks and fly with a better company.",-1

After waiting online for almost an hour on numerous different occasions in one day, then you deal with their terrible customer service. We had a flight scheduled for this month (that we bought insurance for) and ended up having to cancel our trip. We called Spirit and waited on hold for 45 minutes. They said my reason to cancel was not valid and they could only give us a credit. I stated we purchased the insurance though in case we needed to cancel. Then we had to call back 3 more times in the day after they redirected our call to the wrong departments and they still would only give us a credit. They rip you off even if you purchase their airline protection plan. Literally a joke!",-1
2022-02-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Really bad service,True," Really bad service. It’s cheap but they make their money out of your luggage weight. Spirit Airlines standard weight limit is 40lbs when any other airline is 50lbs. I got charged separately for my luggage. I paid over $200 just in luggage. The flight was for my grandma who is senior with hearing and visual impairments. (We made sure they knew about this at the check in). Her flight made a stop in Miami, upon arrival to Miami her flight was cancelled. They made us a refund of $50 dollars for the flight cancellation. They rescheduled her flight for 3 days later. We couldn’t afford to buy a ticket back home and then again back to Miami for the rescheduled flight. My grandma was left all alone in Miami. She called us crying and desperate because she didn’t have anybody to help her out. Their customer service is pretty bad. This is the second time I booked a flight with Spirit and the two times have been a nightmare. I don’t have any positive comments for this airline. Never traveling with them again. Especially, neglecting elderly with disabilities. I called them to ask for a fair refund on my money, but their telephone lines don’t work. We had to buy another flight through another airline. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to any family member or friend.",-1
2022-02-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Cheap seats for horrible service,True,"  Horrible never again. Got to the airport at 10 am for my 12:10 pm flight. We boarded after 20 minutes took us another 30 to get everyone situated and seated.  We took off and less then 10 minutes later had to turn back around as there was an issue with the planes oil system. Once we landed told us we can remain seated as it was be paper work and that’s that. Joke. An hour and a half later we are all told we need to de board the plane with no update given to us as to what was going on. About 4-5 hours later we are updated from the site that the flight was canceled and delayed until the following date 2/3/2022 at 6:50 am. I could simply not do this flight as I had to attend a funeral. You think they cared? Nope. Best they could do was book me in horrible seats on a flight that was with a stop. From Boston to Fort Lauderdale at 5:37 pm till 9:15 pm. From there to Orlando in an hour. A stop that crossed paths with a stop to get to Orlando even with a two hour lay over. Of course spirit was late yet again. Flight was delayed a whole hour maybe more. My mother needed wheel chair assistance so it was even more of a hassle. Got on the plane got there at 9:55 pm I had to wait for someone to assist us with a wheel chair. Our layover flight left at 10:15 pm. Flight attendants had assured us our next flight was aware of us just getting there and we would still be able to board the plane as my mom needed the assistance. Lol what a joke. The person who assisted us brought us to the wrong terminal once I noticed we were in baggage I had to tell him where we were suppose to be. Once we got there rude spirit desk lady pretty much slammed the doors in our faces and stated nothing could be done. Not her problem type of thing and walked away. Had went to 3 different customer service desks with this assistant for us not to speak with an actual supervisor after waiting over an hour just to get some assistance since we had missed our previous flight. Only to get a voucher for a hotel meals and rides there to the hotel and back to the airport for our flights the next morning. Even worse. I made sure to call and book for a hotel before I left the airport with the supervisor from spirit as people were being sent back due to lack of room availability. Due to all the canceled flights just from spirit alone. We got to the hotel from them to tell me the vouchers were not activated and they had there hands tied. Tried sending me back to the airport as I could not be sitting in the lobby waiting. We had waited two hours just to get a room. To sleep less then two hours to be back at the airport for 7 am as we didn’t get into our room till 3:30 am showering etc caused us some time to be wasted. We went through security once we got there the worst customer service ever. Never ever will I fly with them again. Worse airline services ever. Seats are trash, customer service sucks, nothing is worth the head ache this airline causes. Cheap seats for horrible service. Would rate then negative stars if I possibly could.",-1

Unfortunately due to the weather my appointment that I had to attend in Colorado was canceled. I called the airline and I was hung up on twice, I'm calling 11 days ahead of my trip, they said they’re not giving me a refund, basically they get 147$ for themselves and I get 130 as a credit!

2022-02-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to New Orleans,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,the worst I’ve ever experienced,False, I’ve never been treated more poorly by airport staff in my life. I’ve flown hundreds of times. Spirit has consistently been horrible. I’ve taken them the past 6 or 7 trips I’ve been on and they are genuinely the worst I’ve ever experienced. Some of the workers seem to lack a heart entirely which reflects upon the company’s reputation as a whole. The leg room is worse than Delta. They do not have tvs on their aircrafts. They will also charge 132$ for a carry on over 20 lbs. Dont spend your money on spirit. They deserve to receive what they give: nothing good.,-1

I only had a personal item, and its all I needed. The flight cost me $23 and the uber from the airport $55. Coffee on the plane cost me $3.25 but it was pretty good coffee and the coffee that I bought at the Starbucks at the airport cost more. Despite the 6.00 am departure, the staff were pleasant. The plane left and arrived on time. I booked relatively late due to a funeral. Direct flight. What more could you expect.",1
2022-02-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Ft. Lauderdale via Myrtle Beach,,,,,,,3.0,worst I have ever experienced,True,"  Spirit Airlines deserves this review because their customer service has been atrocious, possibly the worst I have ever experienced anywhere and by any business. So I caught COVID when I was supposed to fly out right after Xmas in December 2021. I cancelled my flight in time and was expecting incidental fees to be tacked on. No big deal. I got a reservation credit. I now want to fly Spirit again, but this time for a destination in Mexico. I want to use this reservation credit, which does not expire until the end of March 2022. First, there are flights on Google Flights that are substantially cheaper than flights on the official Spirit Airlines website. In fact, the flight that I am about to book on Google is listed as ""full"" and thus ""unavailable"" on the Spirit Airlines website. So already this airline is acting mighty shady. Then I go to customer service to see if I can use the reservation credit through Google Flights. I wait for an hour the first time around and then hang up. Then I go to the Spirit Airlines ""chat"" feature for customer service and twice I am logged out. Both log-outs were made to look like I already was serviced by a customer agent when in fact I was not. Then I call again, readying myself for an hour plus when I get a human being within seconds. Surprised, I am excited that I will finally settle this situation, by first asking what's the deal with the different prices on Google Flights when compared to the Spirit Airlines website. This human being then proceeds to tell me that Google Flights is a ""third party"".  Then when I ask if I can extend my reservation credit deadline from beyond the end of March 2022, he says that I need to call a week before the expiration date and that ""rules and conditions"" will apply. I then ask where these ""rules and conditions"" sit within the Spirit Airline website and I am directed ""Contract of Carriage,"" which provides me little information on what ""rules and conditions"" apply. I want specific reasons why he won't tell me why these ""rules and conditions"" are so vague, and not even in the contract. He gives me more generalities. I was hoping the manager would clarify with me precisely what ""rules and conditions"" apply for that discussion about the status of my reservation credit one week before the expiration date. . He didn't transfer. Against my better judgment, I will fly Spirit Airlines to my Mexico destination because the price is pretty good. I will not judge on the in-flight service yet. 
The worst I have ever experienced. Use this airline at your own risk.",-1

Besides them ripping you off, their customer service is horrible. I had missed a flight and tried rebooking it and a customer service member did it over the phone and told me I am all set to travel with a different airline which they transferred my flight to. There was 8 of us with the same issue and once we got to the airport to check in with the new airline, we were told there was nothing in their system saying that we would be traveling with them. We headed over to Spirit customer service and stood in line for over an hour and the agent that helped us said that we could only travel 2 days later because there’s nothing available in her system. I found that extremely unprofessional and terrible customer service because their agents doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Spirit will never be an option for me to fly with again. This is insane. When I called the Spirit Airlines customer service to complain about the miscommunication, we were told that their system does show that our flights were transferred to United Airlines. I recorded the whole thing for proof to use after and was told that they have to talk to the back office and get back to me. Please, stay away from this company.",-1

It was completely unprofessional. The cheap flight kept getting more and more expensive.

Now you have to pay $66 which is double other airlines and the price goes up as you add bags. Spirit airlines has no guest service, we felt like cattle being lugged around. They can't even afford to provide a soda and small snack, everything is for purchase. Our tickets that cost $66 ended up being almost $250 by the time you were done checking your carry-on both ways. At this rate, it's better to book with United or American pay a little more up front but get the service and quality you expect, rather than upcharges for every little thing!",-1

Cheap fare and you get what you pay for. There were 30 people on a plane that holds 90+ yet we were all crowded in 3 across rows. We had to ask two stewardess if we could separate for room. They told us it is a balancing issue! No comp drink or snack. And rude help, in the gate and on the plane - Pay the extra and use a real airline.",-1
2022-01-26,0.6,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,3.0,5.0,the difference flight attendants make,False," I wanted to give give 2 reviews and the difference flight attendants make on trips. I flew with my daughter and 6 year old grand daughter from Orlando to Dallas on Friday, Jan 21st. Our flight left at 4:25 PM. We had the most genuine and kindest group of flight attendants on the plane. They were so thoughtful as to checking on the little kids and babies on the plane. They also took a moment to bring my grand daughter a snack box because they over heard her complaining she was so hungry. The flight was smooth and actually arrived 20 minutes early. Now another story when I flew home myself on Monday Jan 24th at 7:20 PM. The flight attendants were very distant. They encountered a drunk passenger and had a very hard time resolving the issue to the point he refused to leave the plane and it ended up the entire plane have to deplane. Why did the police not come on the plane and escort him off. People were saying because your airline was afraid of people recording on their phones. Make no sense. So our plane was originally supposed to land at 10:53 pm we landed at 11:25 then we sat because there was not any people to bring us in to the gate. It ended up a terrible night. So good and bad reviews. I hope my first flight and the flight crew get a shout out.",1

What a ridiculously classless business model. Wifi I paid $5 for was intermittent and slow, and wasn't available on the connecting flight. The flight time was changed half a dozen times before the date of our flight. The check-in experience is misleading, and makes you believe that if you do not pay extra for seats, you may be separated from your travel companion. Spirit allows planes to be completely full during a global pandemic which makes social distancing impossible. Flight attendants did their absolute best to get people to keep their masks on but with no recourse whatsoever, adults and children alike flew either wearing their masks improperly or, in the case of two children well above the age of 5 coughing and sneezing maskless the row behind us for the entirety of the flight. Furthermore, the plane looked like a music festival just happened when we left. Crushed chips and wrappers covering floors and seats. We flew American on the way to our destination and it was simply night and day. I will never fly Spirit again and I will tell everybody I know to avoid it. The crew was professional and gracious, but the company is a joke where the punchline is getting covid while being nickeled and dimed by their laughable business model.",-1
2022-01-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Punta Cana,2.0,,1.0,,,5.0,5.0,Absolutely atrocious,False," Raleigh to Punta Cana. Absolutely atrocious. Absolutely the worst, staff were extremely patronizing and were demanding that passengers put their mask over their mouth while they were chewing! The worst customer service I have ever experienced. They were a terrible team and that was their entire emphasis on the whole flight of over the ocean. They told me specifically they were targeting me because they saw me eating without the mask on. Give me a break, It was the worst experience and terribly stressful. They need to learn some people skills in understand this mask thing should not be the only priority in flight.",-1
2022-01-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester–Boston to Tampa,,,,,,,1.0,Haven't flown yet and its already a mistake,False," Haven't flown yet and its already a mistake. First time using Spirit. Clearly wont make that mistake again. The only option I wanted was to purchase a seat assignment. Their own web info says seats starting at $5.00 depending on the flight. What I got was a $131.00 bundle that I never wanted. As soon as I noticed it, I tried the chat service. What a joke that is. So I called for a refund and the customer service rep said it must have been a mistake but she could not issue any refund. They fly planes call around the country and cant offer a simple $100.00 refund? If they need the $100.00 that bad, kinds tells you to stay off the plane. And the agent couldn't have cared less.",-1
2022-01-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Pittsburgh,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I wouldn't put my worst enemies on these planes,False,"  I have never seen such a bizarre, haphazard, guess it as we go company. Everything al a carte sounds great until you realize it's just as cheap to fly Southwest. 90min in line to get bags checked because they have 3 people for several planes leaving at once. So once that was fixed we took off. To be diverted to Detroit. Said it was too snowy to land. OK, sounds reasonable. Except that was almost 4hr ago. Family I'm talking to says it's been clear all day. They're waiting for people wondering where we are. So they refueled, taxied out, went oops we have the wrong pilots, and went back to the terminal. No one is telling us if we are actually leaving or not. Who knows if we are going to be in Pittsburgh at this point. Then to have the nerve to still charge for water and snacks when forcing people to sit inside a tube for hours and hours. I wouldn't put my worst enemies on these planes. At worst they're a terrible company with no desire to serve customers, but to extract money from them. At best, they're the best ad agency for Southwest. I will always recommend flying with SW. Hilarious and amazing staff, affordable, and never had issues. Spirit is trash. Plain and simple.",-1
2022-01-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,how bad this experience has been,True,"  Our flight started in Indianapolis. We were told to arrive 3 hours early. So w arrived at 3am. TSA opened at 4:30am. Loaded the plane at 5:30am. Pull out of the gate on time. Then they find a problem with the plane start up. We sat on the plane for 4.5 hours. We were told we couldn't exit the plane because it wouldn't take long to fix. They never offered a beverage or snack while we waited. Not for free or purchase. We finally take off and land. They did offer items for purchase. Very poor customer service in my opinion. Now we arrive 3 hours early to fly home. Departure time was 11:55. Then 1:30pm, now 2:25 pm. On the flight here I did contact them on Facebook. Once they realized they were in the wrong. They stopped responding to me. I'm not sure how much we saved flying with them, but I will spend the money next time. I am 100% sure this is a one and done airline. My wife has used them once before, and had the same issues. I don't usually leave negative reviews. I like leaving positive things in reviews. But I have to let people know how bad this experience has been.",-1

Second or third night in a row this flight was cancelled. Horrible communication on the staff’s part. They had us waiting 7 hours yesterday and 5 hours today. A lady was very upset about missing her wedding and Spirit doesn’t care. The attendants are extremely rude and act irritated when we just want any update we can get. There’s a reason people say this is the worst. Never flying with them again. The extra $40 extra for another airline is nothing in comparison to the stress Spirit will give you.

I don't just think Spirit has the worst customer service in the airline industry, but truly they have the Worst Customer Service of any business I've ever experienced.

I fly every month from Las Vegas to LAX and back since 2017 and this is the 1st time I flew on Spirit Airlines and the travelling roller bag I always carry on was denied carry on and I had to pay more than the flight to check it!

The outbound flight was cancelled at 11PM on 12/30/2021 and email was sent stating we booked American Airlines flight for you to DFW. These emails were sent when I was in deep sleep. I saw the email before starting to airport. From 9AM to until evening 6:45PM (vacated the AirBNB, I went to airport, returned the rental car and started my calls to spirit airlines) for each customer call I was holding the line to get representative on line for 1hour. Like this I made 4 calls to customer service - requesting to put me on 12/31/2021 flight or provide accommodation as my 11 year old started showing signs of sickness. by 5:15PM my son's temperature went up to 102 degrees. I was pleading the customer service to help me with putting me on a flight which can reach my home by even midnight.  I booked American Airlines for $800 and somehow managed to reach home that night. Next day I asked to process my refund for ""Not flown"" flight and all that Spirit airlines paid me is $78 ($30 baggage and $48 for the seats that I paid). The thought process of the management and airline founder is cheap..",-1
2022-01-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,they frequently cancel flights,True,"  This airline should not be allowed to operate. I (unfortunately) have to utilize Spirit frequently because they have an “affordable” direct flight along a route I travel often. However, they frequently cancel flights without notifying their passengers, delay flights for long periods of time without notifying their passengers, and make any attempt to grab at money they can. Most recently, I purchased a checked bag on both legs of my round trip flight. Mind you, the bags themselves cost more than the actual flight. When the bags did not show up on my itinerary, I made the horrible mistake of reaching out to their customer service. After waiting almost an hour to speak with a representative, they informed me that I had only purchased one leg and they would be happy to add both to my itinerary for an additional $50. I was charged for both legs, and the customer service representative was extremely unhelpful and kept insisting I purchased one. Well I guess my bank, who showed both purchases, was incorrect.",-1

To start off - they charged us $88 for over the allowance weight - we had 2 suitcases (one per each of us), for which we paid $65 dollars each plus the additional $88.00 for overweight (which is over 45lbs) and our suitcases were 55 lbs each (this is international flight). We paid additional fee for extra leg room which was another $30.00. All together the flight was over 6 hours, but the seats were uncomfortable, no entertainment and not even a glass of water. When we came back to BDL, we received our luggage and went home right away as it was around 1am and we were tired after almost 6 hours flight. In the morning when inspecting the luggage we found that both of our luggage's were damaged severely, to the point where we couldn't use them anymore. One suitcase had a hole on a bottom and the other one was missing a wheel. Trying to contact Spirit Airlines is impossible - they never answer the phone.",-1
2022-01-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Baltimore,,,,,,,1.0,never get a refund from this airline,False," Second time ever using Spirit Airlines.  Used their website to change my ticket within 3-6 days of departure, for which website lists a fee of $79. Changed to a non-stop flight for exact same price as the original indirect flight. Expected to be charged $79. I was charged $330, which isn't even evenly divisible by 79.  Their ""customer service"" supervisor tried telling me that things change all the time and that her system was showing that their actually was a difference in the ticket cost, which I never would have proceeded with the ticket change if that were true. Also she stated that the website informed me that there would be all kinds of other/additional fees and charges, which again, I never would have decided to change the ticket if I had been told these things. So she ""was unable to refund the amount"". I feel really bad for the position they put their poor ""customer service"" (actually they act as customer deflection shields) in. You will never get a refund from this airline. Of any type. For any reason. You, the customer are wrong and they are right. Period. That is actually their business model.",-1
2022-01-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Orlando via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,going through hell,True," Lima to Orlando via Ft Lauderdale. Flying with Spirit Airlines has been the worst experience I have had as a passenger. My flight was delayed for more than an hour. At the check-in counter in Lima, I was told that I would be missing my connection from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. Although my flight was on January 3, they were offering me a connection for January 6, without assuming any of the expenses that my stay in Fort Lauderdale would cause during those 3 extra days. When I put my suitcase on the scale, I learned that the maximum weight allowed was 18 kilos. I was both furious and surprised because I had paid 65 dollars for a suitcase that weighed 5 kilos less than what you are allowed in any other airline. They did not make any concessions despite all the trouble that their flight delays was causing. When I finally got to the Spirit Airlines rebooking counter in Orlando, there was an endless line. After being in line for more than an hour, a lady called out:""Those of you going to Orlando, follow me, please"". They got me along with another 9 passengers into a shuttle, and sent us to Orlando without us, passengers, being given any other alternative. As a result, we arrived at the Orlando airport after 3 P.M. as there was heavy traffic on the road. I missed my bus connection to Gainesville, which was scheduled for 2:00 P.M., and had to stay at a hotel overnight at my own expense. We did not receive any meals vouchers that the Spirit agent promised we would get. I do not even want to talk about the service offered onboard because that is just infamous, to say the least. I just wonder how American Airlines can risk its prestige by offering return flights with Spirit Airlines. That is beyond any logic given the fact that Spirit Airlines is certainly affecting the well-deserved reputation of American Airlines. In a nutshell, flying with Spirit Airlines is literally going through hell. Never again.",-1
2022-01-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to St. Louis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never Spirit Airlines again,False," What a way to spend your new year eve and new year! Flight got cancelled two days in a row without any explanation.  Absolutely impossible to get hold of customer service or provided whatsapp number to discuss any alternate options. We ended up spending $800+ dollars on hotels/transportation as all the prices were sky rocketing on new year. Since we could not get hold of customer service, we drove to airport to discuss our options to get home. The agent said, there are no flights available to Chicago for 5 more days after the 2 days cancellations. how bizarre! We could not afford to spend thousands of dollars to stay 5 more night, so we ended up flying from different airport in Florida to another nearby state, rented a car and drove 5.5 hours to get home. Lesson learned never Spirit Airlines again.",-1

If you're looking to get from point A to point B safely and efficiently, then Spirit is great. I don't need fine dining in the air for a 2-3 hour flight. If you work the system and gain status with Spirit, all of the things that most people complain about paying for (checked bags, carry-on, seat selection, snacks, schedule changes, etc.) are free. They even have wifi now. I pay extremely low airfare to fly on Spirit and I get extras for free. Know what you're getting into and you won't run into any problems.",1

Bounced around for hour after hour in lines because workers would disappear. Every flight I had was delayed or changed last second while at the gate. Missed multiple flights. Stuck, wasted the whole reason for the trip. Final insult charged me the same as my whole plane ticket overseas for a grocery bag with 2 pairs of shoes in it after making me miss my connecting flight.",-1

2022-01-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no available gates to let us off,True,  This is the worst airline in the world.

This is unbelievable.,-1

No help to get us to Florida any other way. We finally told them there was a flight out of Cleveland that would take us to San Juan to catch up with our cruise 3 days later.. Norwegian accepted this. BUT we had to take a Lyft to Cleveland and wait there for 5 hours. Go to Miami and wait another 2 hours. Get a flight to San Juan and arrived at 2 am. We are going to fight with Spirit to at least help us with our room expenses for 3 nights. Room cost in San Juan was 400.00 a night including all the taxes. And not to mention the food. This would have all been paid for on our cruise. This is just the beginning of our terrible experience with Spirit. From long lines to unhelpful customer service to long waits to talk to anyone. To waiting hours in baggage drop off lines. And to top it off our flights for 2 were 1250.00. NOT a cheap priced airline. I have flown all my life on other airlines and I am not new to flights. I will say that Spirit deserves a rating of zero. I will never ever fly Spirit again and suggest if you want your sanity that you won’t either.,-1
2022-01-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,I would not recommend anybody,True,"  The problems began at the check-in to my departure flight (EWR-MCO,) where I was pulled aside for a few minutes while every other passenger boarded next to me. The employee checking me in was on the phone while attempting to check me in, and seemed confused but to not care much at the same time. I was finally allowed on the flight with just a few passengers left to board. The flight to Orlando was perfect, and everything was fine except for the checked baggage taking exceptionally long to arrive after landing. The day before my return flight, I called in to see if there was any possibility of pushing my flight back (as I had seen multiple seats available for later flights online.) After waiting on hold for approximately a half hour, I was connected to an agent who then told me that I had no flight booked. Upon more holds and investigating, I was informed that my return flight was cancelled due to me ""not arriving"" to my departure flight. After further discussion, I was told my only option was to re-instate my initial flight for a $30 fee. I told the agent it was ridiculous to me that I would have to pay to re-instate a flight that never should have been cancelled in the first place. I was eventually offered to be transferred to a supervisor, where I was then on hold for another hour and half before the call was dropped on me. At this point, I was already in contact with the online chat and called back in to attempt again on the phone. In total, I was on hold for about six hours before the initial flight was re-instated through the online chat. I hung up the phone line, and just accepted that I at least had my initial flight re-booked. That was, at least, until I arrived at the airport and was told that there was no checked-in bag for my ticket. I was then forced to pay an additional $70 to bring the bag, I had already flown down with, back up with me to Newark. I was able to make my flight home where, upon arrival, I noted the time that I had arrived to the baggage claim gate. From that point, it took over 30 minutes for the bags to begin coming back for the fellow flight members and I. It was then the next day, and I was looking through my bank statements just to confirm everything looked correct when I found an additional $3.50 fee from Spirit Airlines for ""Onboard Irving TX"". I have never been to Texas in my life, and am now concerned about the company falsely charging me even further for things that never even happened. If not everything else that went completely wrong with these flights and the customer service between, I find immensely unacceptable that I was allowed on my flight to MCO without the company even acknowledging me on the flight. At that point, I could have been any single person allowed onto the plane without any definitive answer as to who; and I find that genuinely terrifying. It is for the multitude of reasons listed above that I will never fly Spirit Airlines again, and I would not recommend anybody else to as well.",-1
2022-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Complete waste of time and unnecessary stress,True," Not only did I have a terrible experience with Spirit, but within 2 days my brother and I concluded we will never fly Spirit again. During our Christmas vacation in Florida, my brother went to fly back to Jersey and when no ticket was found they told him he was never on the plane down to Florida (which he obviously was since he was in Florida) and after being on the phone with customer service for 6 hours he was finally refunded another ticket, but without his baggage so he had to pay another $75 for his bag. Sounds like a major security issue to me, they completely weren’t aware of a passenger being on board? Then, 2 days later when the rest of my family is at Tampa airport ready to go back to Jersey, we check our bags in (which is also a scam because the scales in the beginning of the line read my bag to be 37 pounds then when you put it on their scale they use to determine if you’re overweight, it magically went up to 41 pounds) then go to TSA. The guy at the desk tells me that my date of birth on the ticket does not add up to my ID, so he can’t let us through. We then have to go back to the transit and take that to where we originally started, just for them to tell us that the dates are all matched up and they don’t know why we were just sent back there. Third and last, while on the plane one of the stewardess was quick to demand I pull my mask up after it slipped from my nose, while hers was not even being worn. Complete waste of time and unnecessary stress after already being in a stressful environment. NO communication within workers + system errors there that will cause someone to miss their flight, and clearly very poor training which is quite worrisome being that these people are in charge of our safety. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. Your life costs more than a cheap plane ticket. With all the stress and blatant carelessness this airline will give you, I promise you it’s 100% more worth it to just buy a slightly more expensive ticket through other airlines.",-1

The lady at the airport kept calling people that were arriving late for their flight putting everyone that was on time behind. We were late to board our plane thanks to the horrible system they use.

We waited in line for four hours at the customer service counter to be told they could get us on a flight in two days (after trying several cities and being bounced around between counter staff) - who, btw I feel absolutely terrible for. We were originally scheduled to leave on January 2nd, and were rebooked for a flight January 4th. They said they would give us a hotel voucher via email, which never came. They text us a food voucher that was only valid for the same day in the airport, problem was all the restaurants in the airport were closed. When we asked if we could talk to a supervisor, we were told we could try but that it may take several more hours of waiting. We also tried calling customer service while in line for four hours, which was just as fruitless. I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again, and I suggest you don’t either if you want to preserve your mental health and any stress relief you got while on your trip.",-1

2022-01-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst travel experience ever!,True,"  This was by far the worst airline I've ever flown with. The lost my baggage sent it to 3 different states as well as someone else's address, I didn't receive my bags for 5 days. Then when trying to find out where it was I ended up on the phone a total of 13hrs, 6 different managers everyone had a different story, the email info they sent me was someone else's info and baggage confirmation number. I gave up and went back to the airport and my bag was sitting in their office and when trying to get a refund they were extremely nasty, did not want to help, ended up speaking to 3 more mangers. Then after dealing with that my daughter flew back to BWI from MCO, checked in after waiting in extremely long line, got to her to find out the plane was delayed, then they switched gates, then they cancelled the flight all together. Then while trying to get her on another flight they ended up cancelling numerous flights to BWI so we stood in a line with about 1,500 other people to find out their computer systems were down and they couldn't do anything or print anything, they wouldn't give out vouchers then since we checked her bag, no employee could tell us where it was, I just happened to go down to baggage claim and found it on a carousel. After all of these problems I decided to book her a Southwest flight, after doing the online refund then woke up to an email that they booked her a flight on southwest anyway so then I had to waste more time calling to cancel that fight and making sure the refund was done correctly. So after 5days 13hrs on the phone 6hrs in the car a night at the airport and all the nasty customer service we received we finally got the the baggage back suit case broken by the way and my daughter off but with an airline we should have used in the first place!

Spirit gave us a voucher for 419.59 which was to be used by August. It was extended til December 31st due to COVID. Called to get it extended longer because I work for the post office and I knew I wouldn't be able to use it by the end of the year. I was told they couldn't extend it yet that I had to call back December 30th no sooner no later to get it extended. Its December 30th and I have already spoke to one representative who is refusing to extend the voucher. She went as far to tell me I was just out by 419.59. I told her that was unacceptable because it wasn't my fault their voucher was no good and didn't work when we went to rent the car in the first place. I asked to be transferred to a manager and that was nearly an hour ago. I'm still on hold. I'm sure at this point I will never see my money back. They better enjoy the 419.59 because that's the last of my money they will see. I will pay extra to use another airline.,-1

Our flight schedule was leaving Louisville,KY at 6am. So reading the reviews we went to the airport at 3.30am. It was smooth sailing through the check in and everyone with Spirit was very nice. Our flight left 5 minutes early and landed 20 minutes early. We did not have any issues or complaints about our flight. The flight attendants were very nice and polite. I was expecting the worst after reading these reviews. So thank you Spirit Airlines for proving those reviews wrong for me today. I enjoyed my flight and I will fly again next week to come home and will post that flight review as well. Great Flight and great employees.",1

Traveled with a family of 5 with 4 ticketed and one lap child. Thought I was saving money to find out bags are considered overweight at 40lbs, and not 50. Had to pay over weight fees on all the bags. That admittedly was my mistake, but almost $300 for bags and this is only the first leg of the round trip. At the connecting flight in LA, I was charged $80 for a carry on bag. How do you get charged for a carry on bag for a connecting flight? And how $80? They claimed it was supposed to be checked in and it was a checked bag. How did a checked bag end up not being checked before the first flight. If it was, how did we have it at the time of the second flight? The extremely cheap rates pretty much become the same as all others once you pay for bags, overages, and other nonsense. A $2500 trip is going to cost well over $3200 or so by the time of the return trip with bags and and everything all over again. At the end of the day, you pay the same after all additional fees, have no wifi, no electronic device charging, no complimentary snacks. Do yourself a favor and pay more and get what you pay for instead of being nickeled and dimed.",-1
2021-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Chicago,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never again flying with them,True,"  Never flying with this airline ever again. Please spend your money somewhere else, it will be worth it trust me. First time I flew with spirit they charged me twice for my bags and instead of giving me a refund they gave me a credit. I was forced to flight with them again to claim this credit. This time everything was smooth. I decided to give it a third chance and flew with them to Chicago for Christmas. I had to paid $204 for 2 checked bags and 2 carry-ons. I thought that would cover the round trip since it was with the same airlines. Nope! I had to pay for the same bags that I already paid for, again! The only difference is that this time they were charging me $230. I called the airline and they gave me a discount to $176 which is still ridiculous! I paid $900 for the round trip and on top of that I had to pay almost $400 on bags. This is the “cheapest airlines” that charges a bunch of money for your bags. I rather pay a higher fare and not deal with this bs. I ended up paying around $1200+ for a round trip to Chicago for a family of 4. I could’ve paid the same and be comfortable and worry free with another airline. Even southwest or American Airlines doesn’t charge $59 for checked bags. Never again flying with them.",-1

Spirit changed 3 flights to different gates the 3 hours I was waiting for my flight. Never updated the app because people were so confused. Those needed wheel chairs were moved back and forth with no reasoning to move. My flight was scheduled for 9:00 boarding and delayed because "" a flight attendant was late"". We waited for hours with no update, because the attendant stated she had no update. The app NEVER updated the status. When they finally boarded at midnight we waited for over 20 minutes for ""paperwork"", I have never been on a flight where they walk on and off the plane with paperwork. The flight attendants start by saying, ""since the flight is so short we will not serve any snacks or beverages"". And on Spirit you pay for it, its not complimentary. All other airlines manage to serve snacks on the 80 min flight to RDU. Clearly Spririt attendants are not capable. This was the Walmart of flights, the Walmart of customer service. Unorganized, rude and unprofessional. The pilot was nice and professional and the fly and landing were great. But packaged together I will never fly Spirit again. First and Last. No regards for your money or your time. Nothing is complimentary, no beverage, no snack, no wifi, no entertainment, no respect, no professionalism, no good experience.

Boy did we realize really quick that we should've spent more money on any other airline on the planet. Both ways there was delays due to incompetence, they put on a broken tug, only to have to get a mechanic to replace it before we can even back away from the gate. On the way back there was someone vaping in the bathroom and it set off the alarms. The quality of toilets are terrible, they must clean and restock them monthly. On our flight back we are delayed for already an hour and counting after we've landed. No one knows what's going on, we're still here. Several people here have connecting flights and places to be. If you guys thinking about flying save your money and pay a little extra and go with another airline.",-1

As we arrived to the airport we were notified that our flight was canceled and we would not be able to leave till 24 hours later. Later in the week, traveling to the airport to fly home, our flight was canceled yet again. Do not fly spirit airlines. The prices are not worth the hassle of rebooking a new flight, especially since the staff we also encountered were horrendous and not helpful whatsoever. A friend of ours who flew spirit as well was also stuck for 30hrs due to his flight being canceled and them not being able to provide another flight out (due to them canceling quite literally, every.

My cousin is immune compromised and very high risk for severe illness/death from COVID. Attempted to cancel this flight over 1 week from scheduled flight and they are refusing refund. We are in a pandemic and unfortunately we are all suffering health wise and financially. For a multi-billion dollar airline to decline refund for an unforeseen medical issue is horrendous. I was offered flight credit but last time I received flight credit for them due to a surgical emergency, I was denied the flight credit after it was applied.

Upon entering, an older gentleman was assisting people at the kiosks and helping everyone get situated, bags weighed, and was reminding people to grab their things. He was so kind and helpful and kept things moving smoothly. On the flight the head or lead flight attendant was wonderful. She was so kind to my toddler and made our trip better. He had a difficult time transitioning into his car seat for the trip and getting settled. She brought him a treat, used his name, distracted him and helped me feel better too. She was very calm and friendly. He became restless mid flight and she offered him another treat. She was absolutely amazing. The other staff was friendly and accommodating too. Thank you.

Their customer service is absolutely horrendous, and they don't give two thoughts about their customers. They canceled my Christmas business flight 4 hours before my flight, and I didn't find out until I traveled three hours to the airport. They refunded my ticket but I spent $206 dollars on a new ticket with another company, and Spirit will not pay for my additional ticket. They have the worst customer service of any company that I've ever dealt with in my entire adult life.",-1
2021-12-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,nightmare of an experience,False," Spirit is a complete and utter joke of an airline to say the very least. My family and I were flying in to Newark for the weekend and not only did we get left behind, but in line to check our bags. They had said they would call for all passengers in line on the flight to Newark since the lines were out of the doorR but bumped us, and I can only imagine several others, off the flight because of how ridiculously overbooked their flights are. Not only did we have to rebook into LaGuardia (without reimbursement), but the new flight arrangement included no return flight. This same scenario played out again on the flight back from LaGuardia where they left us on the terminal with NO final boarding call. Terrible service all around on the part of the airline. It seems that everyone blames everyone else and no one knows how to competently do their job. Will never again be flying with Spirit airlines after this nightmare of an experience.",-1

We get to the airport 3 hrs before boarding check our bags in pay the over weight fee then sit in a dead stop line, they had no staff taking tickets to board people on the plane for another 3 hrs for us to get to the ticket manager for him to tell us it’s to late you miss you flight. So we go to there assistance area for to sit for another 2 hrs - no staff taking any orders or going over peoples tickets by this time lines are through the roof, we finally get to someone for them to tell us no refund and we will not reimburse you for your luggage or our money spent on the ticket. The only thing they would do is give us a flight for the following day for another $200 each which was completely absurd - pay more money because their lack of staff and Service do their job. Service is completely horrible stay away.",-1

We’ve flown Spirit in the past a couple times with no issues. Unfortunately this trip was the worst experience ever. Our flight was supposed to leave Los Angeles at 11:15 PM on December 18 and arrive in Cleveland at 6:47 AM on December 19. Flight was delayed to 1:30 AM, then again to 2:05 AM. 40 minutes before new delayed departure time no announcements whatsoever. Usually airlines give announcements when the flight is significantly delayed. Then it is 1:50 AM and no one has boarded the plane. Still no word on what happened. We board the plane at 2:10 AM. We did not pay for seats and were assigned together 1 aisle & 1 middle seat. Previously, we were on hold with them right when the flight was originally delayed. We waited 1 hour and 16 minutes and then they disconnected before anyone answered. Overall, we will not fly this airline again especially during peak holiday travel. To top it off, the gate agent was really rude. We will stick to our usual airline and go back to flying United in the future!",-1

My holiday plans are ruined and I’m in the process of demanding a refund and it’s been over 3 hours without a person on the line. If I could give negative stars I would this is absolutely insane. My flight was cancelled two hours before take off and if s full refund does not begin processing by the end of the day I’m going to any means necessary to receive full compensation. I work in the hospitality industry and this is a disgrace. Never booking with this atrocity ever again.,-1

At the beginning I made a mistake with the original reservation and called customer service and even though costed me a lot of money the issues was resolved. Now once it was the day for my flight back home the day before they canceled the flight with no reason and sent me the info the night before which I didn’t see it because the flight was pretty early. When I get to the airport realized my flight was canceled and that’s when the problem started. First the counter lady just told me “hey just flight was move for tomorrow, you have to come back tomorrow” of course I explained to her that I didn’t live in that location I will need a hotel or something to stay but she refuse to help with a very poor attitude. Then referred me to the supervisor for a refund which it took 2 hours and I was left in the limbo with no other option to either get in another flight or a hotel for that night. This is the first review I ever done in my life but honestly the money that you save is not worth at all.",-1

Flew to Detroit with my friends to attend Club meet to feed the Homeless Veterans Christmas Dinner. To only get to airport to fly back home and to be lied to and said flight was canceled because of bad weather. No bad weather at from Detroit to Atlanta. Then wanted to give me and my friends a partial refund which I still hadn't received. I had to pay someone to drive all the way from home to come and get us. Next flight was full for tonight. Next available flight is in 2 days. Spirit ruined my good deed. Time to found another airline.,-1

Had a flight scheduled and canceled our flight a couple of hours before departure time. Had to wait in a 4 hour line and couldn’t even tell me why they canceled the flight. They could not accommodate us for a flight until 4 days later. The person helping us rebooked our flight but didn’t tell us that we wouldn’t get a refund if we needed to reschedule she said she could do nothing for us and we had to call customer service. Also when she rebooked us she only gave us a trip to get there and no plane ride to come back when we originally paid for round trip to go there and to come back. So they basically robbed us of our money. They gave us a voucher through email for 50$ which expires tomorrow. When our flight isn’t for the next four days that they had available. Then when I tried calling customer service nobody answered. This was honestly a total disaster and a huge waste of time. Please save your money spend the few extra dollars and go to a better airline. We had reservations to go to and have been saving up and everything got ruined. I am completely in awe of the situation and have no words. Utterly disappointed.

My flight got canceled last minute and I had to wait four hours in line just to get it rebooked. They do have an option for you to rebook online but the waiting time was over an hour, if that was even accurate. The employees were not all that friendly or helpful and one would give you information about some thing and the other one would give you different information. It was very disorganized and confusing. I will never again fly this airline. United and Southwest are much better. Especially because you don’t have to pay for carry-ons and all these extra fees. Please take my advice and save yourself a headache and do not fly this airline. It is not worth the few bucks that you would possibly save.",-1

I booked a flight with them months in advance to come visit my family for the holidays and three hours before my flight early in the morning they send an email that the flight is cancelled. Can't get anyone on the phone (waiting for over 45 minutes), and no way to easily request a refund through the app. I am never flying with this airline again. They might be cheap, but be prepared for everything to go wrong. If you can handle that, then by all means don't hesitate to book with this airline.",-1

We were waiting to board the plane and it got canceled. We waited in line for 5 hours to be told they will give us a voucher to stay somewhere. I run a business and needed to be home when I needed to be. I booked the flight with a return date for a reason. This airlines inability to run an airline should never been a reason for passengers to suffer. Should be ashamed at all the people and kids that this affected. Should never happen and they way it was handled was totally unacceptable! As a business owner I would have started at the top and fired everyone that was involved. I own a business of 300 employees and I should have never took such of a disastrous airline and so many incompetent personal! The staff acted like it was the passengers fault! Someone needs to read this and take action! Everyone blames everyone else but in the end it is the airline’s responsibility to make sure that all passengers are taken care of!

After waiting in the security line, the boarding pass on my phone did not work at the security gate and I had to go back to the check-in counter to get a paper one then go back and go through the security line again. The gate agent charged me $67 for a small suitcase I forgot to check-in. The seats as hard as a wooden bench, and do not recline. There were several passengers wearing masks over their chins. The flight was 3 hours late so I missed my TriRail train home and had to rent a car for $110. The flight attendants gave a loud and obnoxious sales announcement for Spirit's credit card that woke most of us up at 11.30 pm when we were sleeping. You have to pay for anything to drink.

Our entire experience with Spirit Airlines was a disaster! They delayed our initial flight out on our anniversary vacation causing us to miss our connecting flight. After spending 5 hours in the Orlando airport, the only option was a hotel stay that night and missing a day at our all-inclusive resort. The only compensation they wanted to give was $50 towards a future flight and $28 in food vouchers to be used in the airport! The hotel that we chose to stay in advised us that they had no vacancies and that Spirit was terrible about connecting flights and causing over-night stays. To their credit, they found us a room! Fast forward to Dec 11. We are on our way home. The flight crew on NK1021 was the rudest and most unprofessional flight crew I’ve ever experienced! The lectured the plane as if we were in the first grade and threatened to throw anyone off the plane that lowered their mask longer than it takes to eat or drink. If they would’ve spoken to most people like that in any other setting they would have been slapped across their pompous faces! No flight that we were on left on time. The baggage fees were higher than advertised and no one in customer service seem to care at all that they are there to assist customers! I would not fly with Spirit again if the flight was free! I’d rather pay another airline and be treated with respect!",-1

2021-12-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst airline experience of my life,True,"  Worst airline experience of my life. My flight was delayed, I arrived to check in 1 hour before scheduled departure only to be told that check in was closed. Agent proceeded to play a little game with me where they first told me I couldn’t get on the flight which boarded in 1 hour but then told me maybe I could. Then after finding I could, it took three agents 10 minutes on the computer with nobody else in line to figure out how to print me my boarding pass. Ohh by the way when I told them I needed a boarding pass they looked at me like I was from mars and told me I should already have it? They handed me my boarding pass and told me to run as fast as I could to the gate so I didn’t miss the plane. Arrived to gate only to be told that the plane was delayed again for cleaning for another 40 minutes making me wonder why they told me to run so fast. 1 hour later got on the plane, after loading entire plane captain came on and said plane had a serious mechanical problem and now we all needed to deplane and take the next plane…making me wonder why I had been waiting on them 1 hour previously to “prep” the plane only to find out we needed a new plane after getting all strapped in. Another hour later we were preparing to load second plane and some spirit airlines staff starting yelling and screaming in a loud and threatening voice at multiple passengers telling them they were not to talk back to her or give her attitude if they wanted to get on the flight and telling them to listen to what she told them or else basically threatening everyone like an insane person. To top it all off, and add insult to insult after we eventually got on the new plane and the staff kept telling everyone so sorry. I thought wouldn’t it be nice if they offered everyone a complimentary cold drink or coffee as a nice gesture to make up for this mess but they started selling water and soft drinks for $3+ each.",-1
2021-12-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Flights with Spirit was extra stressful,True," We planned to travel from Miami to Denver, December 4th, 2021 and get back to Miami on December 9th. We booked both direct flights and arrived on time at the boarding gates on both flights! Our first flight was done 20 minutes before expected and I wasn't notified about that. My wife is pregnant, she went to the restroom in front of the gate a minute and when she came back they had closed the gate before the time specified on our boarding passes, so we missed the flight and the attendant was super rude! I tried to talk to her, to explain that my wife was coming with my son but it was in vain. They closed the gate earlier than the 15 minutes showed on our boarding passes. The flight departed early and we were not notified about that before. We tried to talk to the attendant explaining everything, showing her our boarding passes and the time but she didn’t care about it and started to yell, telling us that we should be there 45 minutes before. (Unbelievable). We needed to wait about 3 hours in MIA, to get the next flight, that was not a direct flight like we paid for. After that, 10 hours traveling to Denver, passing by Houston, TX first. I tried to explain the situation to many attendants and showing the time, but nobody said anything or helped us, including about the bags that were on the flight, and was left for the day in the baggage claim in Denver. We were charged an extra $600 to get this second flight. Needed to pay extra money to stay in Denver before starting to drive to Aspen. Will never recommend Spirit to anyone! In Denver, when we were coming back to MIA, the flight was late more than 30 minutes and nobody was informed! The attendants at the boarding gate were extremely rude with many passengers that tried to have information. Flights with Spirit was extra stressful and we were extremely disrespected!",-1

2021-12-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"seem to be issues, frequently delayed",True,"  Every time I have flown with Spirit Airlines, there seem to be issues, frequently delayed. On one trip, I purchased a ticket that my daughter was unable to use. I decided to not change anything and keep the seat (since I purchased it) for extra space. I was then told at the gate that if the seat was not full, they would put someone else in it. Only place that you can buy something and have the company take it back because you're not using it. I just booked again and they changed our flight from arriving at 12:30pm to arriving at 12:56am, on a school night! Any night time flight would not work for me because I cannot drive late at night. I agreed to fly the night before and get a hotel since it would not be a school night. I asked that if they switched it, that they honor the cheaper price for the inconvenience since it was $30 per ticket cheaper at that time. They would not even make this concession. I would pay double. Triple their prices to never be treated so disrespectfully. As a small business owner, I would have no customers if I treated them in this manner.",-1
2021-12-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Indianapolis,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Will never again use this airline again,False,"  The worst experience ever, was supposed to depart from Richmond VA at 8.20 am, they had an hour and a half delay causing me to missed my connection flight in Orlando FL. Get there at 9.45am to be told the next flight was at 9.40pm causing me to miss work. Agents were rude, I’m diabetic, I ask if my bags were there so could take my meds, she told me it somewhere and went on to talking to her coworker and greeting staff so I was without my medicine for 12 hours. The flight finally took off at 9.40, get home at 2.08am, waited an hour cause my suitcase wasn’t there to be told it was still in Florida so still had no way to take my meds. Call customer services three times get hung up on, every time I ask for supervisor. Will never again use this airline again.",-1

I flew with Spirit for the first time on November 27th, 2021 leaving Miami, FL. By far the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. First off, the flight attendants were extremely rude, the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I’ve ever encountered on a flight (I’ve flown Delta, AA, JetBlue, Frontier, Etc.). The cabin was very shaky and the bins were old and unstable, causing the entire plane to shake as if it were falling apart. Overall, this was my first and most definitely last time flying Spirit. Don't go if Spirit is your only option.",-1

This is the very first time that I have flown with Spirit and I must say that from the moment that I began my check-in; Daniel, Chyanne and Itiana were the most professional and helpful. They made the entire experience very delightful and pleasant. Above and beyond their duties they went. I wish every passenger could experience such a wonderful trio and their courtesy is most priceless. Glad you have them on your team. Because of them and their professionalism; I will be choosing Spirit Airlines again and again.",1
2021-12-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Jamaica,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never flying Spirit again!,False,  Spirit changed my flight twice and now made it a non direct flight. I would not have booked a flight with a lay over. They changed my flight last year too. I called and they only offered changing my flight to a different day! I already booked my out of the country hotel a year in advance so this was not a solution. Never flying Spirit again!,-1
2021-12-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,they break your Spirit,True," I finally know why this airline is called Spirit Airlines. First they break your Spirit, then they break your wallet. This was my first and last time flying with this airline. While every decent airline has a 50 pound weight limit for checked bags, dear Spirit here under tiny fine print has a checked bag limit of 40 pounds and also try to charge you an additional fees for any carry on bags. So on top of the 120 dollars I purchased for 2 checked paid I got to pay an additional 100 dollars for them being at 50 pounds. Both trips airplanes ran late on top of a rude Nazi like staff. Planes are tiny and packed to capacity, and seats do not even recline and are super uncomfortable. They charge for everything including wifi and try to scam you in other ways. Please do not fly with company or you will end up paying twice as much for a better quality airline.",-1

Reassured me that they would send my bag to Fort Lauderdale from Vegas, they never did! When I arrived back to Kansas City I was told to call a number which I couldn’t get through for days. Finally talked to someone who told me I needed to call a different number. I called that number and they said I needed to file a claim and submit my receipts where I had to spend money I didn’t plan on spending on the items I already had in my bag! I submitted my claim with all my receipts. I received an email from spirit 30+ days later saying I missed the deadline to submit a claim which I weren’t aware of any deadline. They refuse to reimburse me even though they’re the ones who lost my bag!",-1

Crew arrived, flight cancelled, passengers not informed, waited 3 hours then sat on runway for one hour because they had no one to load bags into baggage. Missed our car pickup and had to wait in until the next morning and pay an extra $100 for late car pickup. We tried to discuss some form of professional responsibility from this airline but they clearly didn’t care. Fly another airline at all costs .

He arrived at the airport to check in 1 hr prior to flight (no luggage to check since they charge an absurd amount for luggage). He was told he did not arrive at the airport in time to board the plane since it had already boarded and would need to pay $100 to re-book for the following day. I have never flown an airline that boards the plane 1 hr in advance of departing! I am sure they overbooked the flight and bumped whomever they could along with making them pay extra to rebook. Spirit will steal your money and waste your time.,-1

Your flight attendants told us the connection flights would not leave without us. They clearly lied. Now I'm stuck in Ft. Lauderdale with a toddler and a child because there are no other flights leaving. Why couldn't you just delay the connection flight? So what am I supposed to do with two kids in this airport for the next 24 hours? If I had known you would have sent the connection flight without caring about those who didn’t make it We would have simply stayed at home in our beds until the next day.,-1

Worst flights I have ever been on. Could not check in online for our flight home. Talked to agents via live chat, text message, and on the phone. Not a single person could help me check in or pick my seats. We had to check in at the airport and by then all the seats with extra leg room were taken up. My poor tall husband had to be cramped for 4 hours and all they could say to me was, they were probably already taken up. Worst customer service on any airline I have ever traveled.",-1

I will never fly Spirit again. I thought I was getting a good deal but there were hidden costs that made my total cost more than if I’d flown Delta. You have to pay a ridiculous amount for carry ons- both ways even for a round trip ticket. You have to pay for drinks and snacks. There’s no tv to watch. It’s just cheap. I also connected to their WiFi to and from my destination and it literally didn’t work. Super annoying. I will stick with Delta from now on.",-1

Have never met a Flight Attendant that was so enjoyable. Monica or Monique made our short flight the best ever.

If that doesn’t make it obvious that they don’t care about our health I don’t know what will. I was drinking water when she came up to me and said that I would be fined or that police officers would be waiting for me when we landed if I didn’t put my mask on. She also told everyone over the microphone that if they tried to keep their face mask off by eating “m&ms” slowly they would also get fined. Who gave her this much authority? I thought I was paying them to serve me not threaten me. They were also extremely hypocritical because while she was telling everyone to wear a mask she took her mask off to speak into the microphone. Also, the pilots wear not wearing a face mask while in their cabin. Here’s a picture of the flight attendant without a mask on. Extremely rude, belittling, and hypocritical.",-1

Our flight with Spirit departure was 10.13am, the flight left at 9.20 am. Doors were closed and we were told they couldn’t let us board. We watched it leave us. I had to buy 2 more tickets and take a later flight which caused us to spend the night in California and Denver. The unnecessary money this flight cost me I don’t see you being cheaper at all. That extra money was meant to help my family and thanks to your unprofessional service I couldn’t. Spirit is not cheaper, the price it cost me we didn’t get to view my sister for the last time. We won’t fly again with you nor recommend you to anyone. This is what greed looks like on Spirit flights. We barely got a half a cup of water.",-1

2021-11-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Orlando,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,This is absolutely ridiculous,True," We paid for two bags 56.00 dollars each. One our our bags was 10 pounds extra weight which we were aware of and wanted to pay the extra weight. However for only 10 pounds extra, we paid 50.00 dollars extra. This is absolutely ridiculous, if we knew how ridiculous the prices were when we would have opted to pay for a carry on for 42.00 dollars or just another bag and bring more things from Colombia. Worst airline for sure!",-1
2021-11-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Houston via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,cut every single corner,True,"  It's incredible how Spirit manages to keep finding new ways to show their customers how little they care. From an abysmal check-in experience with a site and app that just fail with no explanation 70% of the time (and the slowest, least competent agents they could find to address this), through tiny, cramped planes used for long international flights, lacking even basics like charging ports (not to mention any kind of entertainment, needless to say), and finally charging extra for literally everything, including _water_. You can really feel the great efforts they've gone to in order to cut every single corner.",-1
2021-11-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Fort Worth to Orlando,3.0,,5.0,,,3.0,2.0,pricing for bags is ridiculous,False,"  Orlando to Dallas Fort Worth. The flight itself was great. However, the pricing for bags is ridiculous! I bought my check bag online for $40.00 but when I got to the airport it was over weight by 14 lbs. so I knew I was going to have to pay a little extra but when I found out that it was $50.00! That is absolutely absurd! I would have understood if it was even $20.00 a little over half the cost of what I paid for a 40 lb. check bag. Dallas Fort Worth to Orlando the flight was perfectly fine even for a smaller plane. The biggest issue I have is the bag drop off. I paid online for a check bag that was $40.00 however when I got to the self check in to print the tag it said my bag weighed 53.1 lbs. so I paid the $75.00 (which is absurd) for an over weight bag. Just to find out that when i went to drop my bag off that scale said my bag was 38.7 lbs. So I asked for a refund to which the lady told me that they do not refund on bags but can give me a credit so I said okay that is fine. She told me that an email confirmation was sent to my email. Again to only find out that that was a lie! I gave the email over night to come in.... nothing!",-1

I read about the measurements for personal items on their website and my bag was measurement for measurement as stated.

2021-10-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will never fly with them again,False,"  I rode with Spirit for many years, no issues, no qualms, and this last time was by far the worst experience I have ever gone through with any airline, that I will never fly with them again. Now let my say I have flown on over 10 different airlines, in over 13 different countries, with many airlines and locations being put on a personal list of mine to never go through again. Out of all my airline experiences not only was this the worst, it was also the one airline that did NOTHING to help me when they screwed me 3 hours before my flight was supposed to leave! They then send me a food voucher for $75, though I paid double to buy tickets last minute with another airline, so it barely eased the sting since I lost $150 because of them. So fast forward through the stress at 3am trying to get another airline and spend more money, I am finally at the airport, with no help after Spirit screwed me. I sit down to eat a meal, ordering enough to get covered by the $75 meal voucher, because why should I lose out on the voucher? So I order $115 worth with my mom, and I even ask the server if it would work just to be safe. She says yes, so great we order. I go to pay, and lo and behold the card is not even declined, it does not exist! The credit they sent me does not exist.",-1

My elderly parents were flying with my mom in a wheelchair and they could not print out their tickets because the kiosks were not working correctly, I wasn't flying with them unfortunately but one of their ticket people took the time to print out their tickets for them and we were able to get them through security and board their plane with her wheelchair so I want to thank them for a change unexpected but very appreciated.",1

Took over an hour to reboot. Spirit planes are dirty, the staff is rude, you get absolutely nothing during you flight experience and now you can’t even count on your flight leaving on time. They offer no credits when they ruin your travel plans and can’t even mussel up an apology. I’m so tired of airlines treating us like this and changing an arm & a leg for it.",-1

They switched the flight departure time to 8:30am while at the airport, didn't tell us that, just noticed it printed on the tickets. They need to be more specific around the posted ticket times. I scheduled transportation in Mexico from the airport to my hotel, the delay caused issued with my private transportation. Very big headache. I've never experienced this with other airlines like Jet Blue, Frontier, or American. Spirit also did the same thing while flying back to US. My flight departure was set for 10:12am, now after having my ticket, realize I won't arrive home until 3 hours after what was originally purchased. It still states my flight is ""ontime"" as I sit here, at the still closed gate, not a Spirit worker at the gate desk. My baby sitter will be forced to stay for the extra time. Very unprofessional, even for a cheap airline, you still shouldn't expect this. Spirit should oversee the logistics and stop playing politics.",-1

Now when I check in online all I get is a paper telling me to see an agent at the desk. My requests to customer service for an explanation are dismissed by both Customer Care and airport employees. I used to enjoy zipping through the airport and that convenience is no longer available to me, now I must come extra early, wait in line behind people checking bags and no explanation or apology given. I decided to give them one more try, hoping it was a one time fluke, but I am facing the exact same issue on the flight I am taking tomorrow.

Tickets are so cheap because the seats are so small. I traveled from Las Vegas to Florida and landed at 11.40pm. Our luggage did not come out until 1.15am. The staff downstairs at Gate G - G3 to be exact - would not tell anyone from our plane (flight 797) where our luggage was. we complained and asked for a supervisor but the supervisor was upstairs and did not want to come down. we all continually asked where our luggage was and the man downstairs ignored us. We asked multiple staff but they were all leaving from their 12.00am shift change. They locked the luggage gates and no one knew where our luggage was. The staff downstairs proceeded to curse out everyone asking for their personal items and then shoved all of the people of out the door and locked us out. Our luggage magically started coming out at 1.15am and the staff was then missing. Worst customer service, disgusting people working for them, and a low class service.",-1

They told me the charges would show up as two separate charges so I booked the flight. Sure enough when I get to the airport they take advantage of knowing I have a flight to catch and charge me for a carry on, charge again for the checked and then claim its overweight and charge for that as well. I call customer service and they deny the second more expensive charge and refuse to refund me. It would have been cheaper to just pay the 550 and fly Southwest.",-1

Without any kind of empathy says that she has to sit down now and put on the seat belt, I can understand that the flight will be delayed but what not I understand how they have such unkind people.",-1
2021-10-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Bogota,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,overrated / overpriced airline,True,"  First of all, the site could not retrieve my booking, making mandatory to waste my time for more than 2 hours from the time the agent came online, for nothing. Unable to change my ticket, paid at a 50% higher than AA already. The only offered modification fee was 1.7 folds of original ticket price, no convenient choices whatsoever. Unfairly overrated / overpriced airline, don’t even consider to waste your energy on it, fly with any other airline, but avoid Spirit. A single change it can easily cost 3 times of a ticket with a major airline, to even consider spirit as an option it’s absolutely senseless. They publish a table that shows fees that are only a minor fraction of the amount beyond the total ticket price. No airline in the world will do that, way less during COVID difficult times. Try to avoid flying with spirit if you do not want to be unfairly treated.",-1
2021-10-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Las Vegas,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,"they have been unhelpful, ignorant, rude",False,"  I have wasted so much time trying to contact Spirit people numerous times and then when I finally come in contact with a Spirit representative they have been unhelpful, ignorant, rude and have a complete lack of knowledge about anything I need help with. I flew out of CLE into LAS and checked a bag when I left from CLE. I waited at LAS's baggage claim for TWO hours after I had gotten off the plane, spoke with several reps who assured me ""You're bag is coming just hold on"" and watched as the representative started loudly yelling and swearing at another person who rode on my flight. Eventually after the airport baggage claim was literally empty and no carousels were running, I was told my baggage did not even make it to my destination. From there, things just got worse, Spirit representatives just got more unhelpful, I continued to put time into trying to contact people for help, track my bag and also had to waste time buying toiletries and clothes - this ruined the first day and a half of my trip. In order to get ahold of my bag, it was supposed to come the following day (I knew the flight it would be on and everything) and I was told by several representatives that it would be dropped off directly at my hotel. I was never able to track that my bag, I called many  times and no representatives were there to help me, I had to pay to be driven to the airport two times, to physically go and ask about my bag and end up find it sitting there the second trip for over 12 hours and no one was going to inform me or have sent to my hotel like I was assured would happen? After the trip I completed my claim by adding each and every receipt I needed to be reimbursed for... now I am told you are not even going to pay for it all? I shopped so so carefully, I even asked two representatives at the airport what I was allowed to buy- she told me ""go to Walmart/Target or a drug store and to keep it cheap no name brands no fancy perfumes .. buy toiletries, makeup whatever you need but keep it cheap""- that's what I did. I literally tried so hard to not be excessive and to keep my outfits minimal. I am now told you will not cover the drug store makeup- literally 3 items, when most women have TONS of products (and especially want to use more when they are in a place like Vegas/going out to a nice dinner and show)I bought three drug store items, literally three items at drug store price. I asked several spirit representatives what is covered and was told makeup would be fine as long as it was not a fancy brand or ridiculously priced. I bought the cheapest three essentials I could find (I will say, comparatively to most woman I think three drug store items- a lip balm, mascara and coverup, is quite conservative) To be quite honest, as a woman, I am offended by your policy and find it absolutely repulsive.",-1
2021-10-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to St Louis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,True,"  Legally changed my last name due to divorce after purchasing tickets. Frontier changed my name over the phone in 5 minutes. Spirit wouldn't do it over the phone, and their automated messaging service I was supposed to use kept saying no one was available to help me and to submit a photo of my new license through the complaint form, which I did. I got a reply that it could be 30-60 days before my message was read, which I didn't have. Waited two weeks and sent another less friendly complaint. Name was changed the next day. Got to the airport and was told the same 39 lb bag I had checked on Frontier with no problem was overweight at 49.5 lbs and I now owed $50 more than what I had originally paid to check the bag. I had not added anything to the bag. I will never fly Spirit again.",-1
2021-10-21,0.7,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Aguadilla to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5.0,4.0,positive experience as long as you plan well,True," My experience was very positive. I just made sure to read the fine print and plan accordingly. With a front seat and checked bags in advance by purchasing the package, I was able to board on time, sleep on a spacious seat and land rested. Cabin crew members were always wearing the masks. And so were the passengers. Flight left on time from BQN, now here’s the trick to understand Spirit, check historical data and understand if the route has a cancelling record. In this case not only did they not cancel any flight to this airport from FLL but they were always on time. I originally booked them because I didn’t want to go through all the mess at San Juan airport, and United and JB’s fares were outrageous. In conclusion, positive experience as long as you plan well, check historical data, make sure you have a plan B (have point of residence in both cities, no ties to itinerary or work / personal commitments). Spirit will get you to point A to point B as long as you understand its cheap - fares operational business. Only real complains were the seat and the schedule. We bought front spacious one, but still not reclining on a red eye can be a misery. Can’t even imagine on people flying on regular seats, but again, you pay for what you get, schedule was a torture - departing at 2.30 am and landing at 5am - not sure why all three airlines operating this route have these nightmare times, but again, $99 bucks / ticket for one way from Puerto Rico to FL it’s a bargain.",1

I tried three times because I knew there must be some sort of error, received and email all three times stating the above. I went ahead and bought a flight with another airline and the payment went through successfully. The day after I received an email from Spirit Airlines letting me know that my flight is in 24hrs. I was furious! I called Spirit Airlines, explained what had happened and clearly told them I did not authorize that payment, how is that possible and i want a refund not flying credit as I’m from the Caribbean and there’s no Spirit Airlines there. To this day I have not received my $500 they took, and every time I call, their customer service representatives with the very thick accents cannot help me. Just stay away from Spirit Airlines.",-1

Accommodations were not met. We were on the phone for three hours trying to get information on what other flight we could be on. After finally getting a hold of someone we were told there wasn’t a flight for another three days. There was no effort to try to be transferred to another airline despite us saying we needed to be home today. When we finally decided to rent a rental car and drive 15 hours home we were not given any kind of compensation. The terrible customer service and cancellation makes me never want to fly spirit again.,-1

This is not the first time we have had this happen with Spirit, nor the second or third. This airline has no regard for its passengers at all.

Over Charges for baggage at the airport. Planes are newer, but filthy dirty. No hand wipes as you board the plane. Food and dirty trash in the back of the seats. The plane is not cleaned well in between flights. Continuous cancelled flights. I have given Spirit Airlines many opportunities to make things right with me & they have failed every time.

Let’s start with customer service. It was awful. The clerk never acknowledged us with a basic 'hello','good morning', nothing. The reservationist assured us that we would not have to pay for luggage because of our Service to Country. This was by far from the truth. We paid over $200 for luggage, not to mention we’ll have to repeat this on our way back. Your weight allowance is a joke! 40 lbs. Really! Our luggage is costing more than the cheap ticket, which by the way, nothing was cheap about this no frills flight. We will never fly this airline again.",-1

Seats are horrible and you are nickle and dimed for every little thing (seat selection, carry on and baggage, and you have to pay for drinks and snack). And the baggage fees are a lot more ($45 vs $30 on delta). And for comparison, we flew Delta on our way north 4 days earlier and were very comfortable and didn't have to pay for snack and drink.",-1

We waited in line and spoke to the counter, the lady proceeds to print out my boarding passes for the 12.50am flight that got canceled and said. ”your all set”. As I was walking away I noticed that it was the wrong ticket so then we spoke to another women who looked up our names and proceeded to tell me we missed our 9.50am flight this morning although all emails, txt & the app say 1.15pm, nothing about 9.50, at that point I cried she got me on a 11.24am flight but that was the worst flying experience I have ever had.",-1

It has been the worst experience I have ever had with an airline, and I would suggest you don't use them either if you want to save yourself the aggravation. They made me pay for a carry on bag although all I was carrying was my handbag and a small backpack. They told me I was allowed only one so I put my handbag in the backpack, and they still made pay $65 for it. I went to my original destination with no problems and was carrying the same exact items on my way back home. On my way back home, there was a lay over in Las Vegas. I had no problems with original destination, nor did I have a problem returning home, but did have a problem on the last leg from Las Vegas to San Francisco. I explained to them that they had not charged me anything on my first two flights and that I was carrying the same things, but they still made me pay. Totally not right! Even the other passengers were asking me about it because they did not feel it was right. I got the feeling some of those people did not pay extra for their bags.",-1

When it was our turn to finally to check in, the lady told me that the flight was no longer taking on passengers because they were closed and at 75% capacity, as if I didn’t buy a ticket 3 weeks in advance. She proceeded to tell me that we should’ve arrived earlier. Then told me that I should’ve checked in online and I explained that their system was not working online which is why I arrived early to have this process done.

After i told my mom in Arabic to wear hers too, the manager went bananas since she heard our Arabic accent and started shouting at my face saying “do not approach” which I haven’t because I didn’t even know she worked for Spirit because of the absence of the uniform and the name tag!  She told me you are not getting onto this flight, i told her i have my boarding pass and i payed the full amount of my ticket, you do not have the right to do that! After that she handle the rest of my group which they obviously treated very rude. Then she called the police saying that i refuse to wear a mask although when they came they saw i was wearing it, and when my mom asked what happened she told her you too are not going on this flight! The officer came and had the whole situation under control however he told us that it is a private company and they give that privilege to their managers to not let people on the flight when they want and he could not do anything about it.",-1

We were at the gate 30 minutes before departure but no calls were made to board or anything. I did not hear a last call to board or any call to board whilst waiting. We missed the flight and a whole day of the vacation because of the ineptitude and laziness of the employees. I will never fly Spirit again.

Could not check in my bag (which I prepurchased at a lower rate) because within an hour before the flight, no one can check in a bag. I had to pay for my bag to be a carry on, but the attendee was so clueless and unhelpful. She could not provide me with any advice and it took 15 minutes for her to think of a solution. Overall, very unprofessional and unfriendly employees.  I booked this flight because it was so cheap, but the stress and discomfort of flying with Spirit is not worth saving a few bucks.",-1

If you have to pay a little extra for another airline I would advise that you do it. Every time I try to give this airline a chance they some how manage to mess it up. They are so unorganized. From losing people luggage’s to having you sit in the plane for hours because a gate is not open or the plane engine failing causing you to sit around not knowing if you are going to go home today or not. When you finally get a replacement plane then they take two extra hours to find your luggage. I have learned my lesson. Pay the extra money to fly with Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, or any other airline besides this one. Wasted so many of our times. Been at the airport since 10am it is now 3.58pm and we are still here not knowing when we will depart.",-1

I am reviewing the airline as a whole. I had a flight with them in 2 days, I get an email showing my flight times that were different than my original flight I had picked out, so 2 days before my flight I had to book another ticket with a different airline because I would have missed a meeting for work, and arrived back home 9 hours later than the flight I had because they canceled my flight. Now I ended up spending an additional $230 to get a new ticket out on such short notice. I have heard of them changing the time by 15 mins here and there, but 4-9 hours?

They lost my husband's CPCP this trip, blah, blah, blah but after 4 days and being on the phone with multiple people and driving to 3 (three) different cities to pick up (not deliver, pick up) his CPAP we were finally able to enjoy our 6 days vacation. However, our flight steward on our return flight was amazing! I was so angry about people not wearing their mask but he was able to calm my fears, took the time to explain how the system works for passenger and staff safety, and had me laughing at the end. The whole flight cabin crew was great. They showed the height of professionalism under fire. I really admire the job they do, do well, and with such grace. I wish them all safe travels in this most difficult of times. The cabin crew gets a 10/10. Spirit Airlines gets a 1/10.",-1

Flight was delayed going and coming from our vacation destination by an hour to two hours. Airports they use are entirely overcrowded and very unorganized. Planes are over booked and not the cleanest. One good thing is that they are cheaper than most and use a direct flight pattern, but you know what they say, you definitely get what you pay for. One of the most terrible experiences flying and once we arrived back in ft Lauderdale was required to wait an additional 30-1 hour because their was nowhere for us to deplane.

2021-09-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,4.0,waiting for an hour to get our suitcases,True,"  Worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I travel 6-7 times a year for vacation. In the past, I've only used Spirit for short flights and nonstop flights to certain cities. Our flight yesterday from BWI to Fort Lauderdale was delayed, which I understand and things happen. Not a concern. We left an hour and a half later than originally scheduled and landed into Fort Lauderdale at around 9:30 pm. There were issues taxiing into our gate because they were still loading another plane. Again, I get it and nothing can be done. My issue is when we waited about an hour in baggage claim to get our luggage. I went to to the Spirit baggage service at Fort Lauderdale airport around 10:45pm and the 2 representatives behind the counter (One was either a manager or assistant manager) were beyond unprofessional and rude and all they could say was ""It is what it is"" and walked away from me. I admittedly yelled back ""Is that what you call customer service and how you treat your customers?"" They responded back with ""I can't deal with this"" and walked into the back room. Multiple passengers witnessed this and was in disbelief. I get flights can be delayed, issues getting into a gate, etc. However, waiting for an hour to get our suitcases after all the delays we had and getting treated the way I did after trying to figure out what's going was completely unprofessional and rude. I never post bad reviews but this got me extremely upset.",-1

2021-09-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I didn't dare ask the stewardesses for anything,True," Worst company I have ever flown with, the stewardesses were extremely rude. I understand it was a night flight but don't sign up for that shift if you're going to do treat the customers like garbage, at one point a stewardess told a customer that they don't answer questions until they're in the air. Well they were serving beverages and snacks that you have to pay for, I kindly asked what type of soda they had, I was told one moment so they could continue their conversation. Last I checked customer comes first. Then the woman gathering trash from people - I was going through my bag looking for something as she came down the aisle, stopped at me, I looked at her and she said do you have trash or not? At no point did I give her any indication that I had trash as again I was going through my bag before she even came near my row. The seats are extremely small, there is no legroom and absolutely uncomfortable. It was a very long flight that I didn't dare ask the stewardesses for anything. I originally booked a flight for me and my husband but he could not make it due to illness and they would not refund or credit his ticket, they told me that since I cancelled it the charge for the cancel is the entire amount. I had also booked my mother and mother-in-law on a separate booking but under my account they didn't see any of us together and I asked to be seated near them and I would have had to have paid I believe it was $21 to be moved. Then once we got on the plane people were seat hopping without an issue, one man literally took up 3 seats to lay down. I will never recommend this company to anyone, they have a bunch of hidden fees, according to online baggage I should have only paid $43 for my bag to go on the plane but when I got there I had to pay 60 and my mother-in-law had to pay $60 as well for a carry on. Airline is absolutely ridiculous, nor did they have any inflight entertainment. At least other airlines have a TV you can watch or play games on, staring at the back of a blank seat like a canned tuna for almost six hours with rude stewardesses is not fun.",-1

It ended Sunday. So I knew when scheduling my flight a month prior to the event to select 19th, a Sunday. Why would I stay any longer when the event I only plan to go to ends on the date I selected my flight to leave? Sunday the 19th. What Spirit Airlines failed to mention was they changed my flight date and manipulated it to push it to the 20th. This was unbeknownst to me the entire time until I tried to board my flight the 19th, and after dealing with the agent she could tell I was furious, but not at her, she was very helpful and provided me the assistance Spirit Airlines fails to provide.  There's not a single recollection of my mind ever telling me that I selected the 20th. Spirit Airlines provided no sort of help, compensation. All they could provide me was that I pay them $99 to have a new flight prepared for me ASAP. I already paid, knew what days I would be there and which day to bring the flight home.

Left my family and 30 other stranded at the airport after not announcing boarding. They delayed the flight 1-2 hours to change a tire and told everyone to get food. Only boarded the people waiting at the gate. The flight ended up being delayed only 45 minutes. Asked them to make it right and they said absolutely not. Get what you pay for I guess.,-1
2021-09-19,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to La Guardia,1.0,,4.0,,,3.0,1.0,not fly Spirit Airlines again,True,"  Beware of this airline, although they offer very good prices for the flights, if booked well in advance, when they make changes for you and then you correct them, they charge you as modifying your flights. original booking was for 4:55 flight out of LGA on 9/15, then Spirit changed it to leaving at 12:30. I booked the later flight due to a business meeting that would not allow any of us to leave at 12:30. I called Spirit and asked them why they changed the flight, they had no answer but said they would change it back (they considered this a first modification), yes, change it back to what I originally booked. New Itinerary - 9/11 flight was not the issue Saturday, September 11, 2021 TIME FLL 12:55 LGA 16:00 FLIGHT 710 Wednesday, September 15, 2021 TIME LGA 12:30 Each modification was due to Spirit airlines making changes and putting us back to the original booking time, they claim I made the modifications because they notified by email. Yes they did with a ""if you do not respond your flights will be cancelled""! Of course I responded, this was business and we had to be in NY. I did not call Spirit back until we returned with my complaint to which their response was, over and over again, you made the modifications. I believe this is how the company makes a little more money on their cheap flights. I know never say never but if I can help it I will not fly Spirit Airlines again and if anyone asks me I will relay this story to them so they will be aware.",-1

We arrived at the terminal to fly home, only to find that they rebooked us on a flight that would connect in Ft. Lauderdale and get us home 12 hours later than the original ticket. I will never use or recommend this airline. They did not contact us about the switch so we could change our arrival plans in Tampa. Very unhappy with this airline.

2021-09-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Kingston to New York via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,delayed every single time,True,"  This is the fourth time in my life I’ve ever flown spirit after the second time I promised myself I would never fly this airline again. I fly every month between the Caribbean and America where I have homes in both places. I had an event coming up on August 24 for my business in America I found a ticket to leave on 23 August arriving on 23 August in New York. As usual the flight from Jamaica from Spirit was delayed every single time the flight leaving Jamaica is two hour delayed with Spirit. I don’t fly it but I have friends that work at the airport so everyone is aware of that delay I took the chance to fly Spirit. The flight was more than two hours delayed it made me miss my connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale, when I got to Fort Lauderdale they were extremely rude, they made a stand on a line from for five hours. The car going to the hotel that they put us in took over an hour to come. The flight that they booked me on was canceled and they had to book me on another flight that was delayed. I did not get home until August 25 and I left Jamaica on August 23 - my event was on the 24th finding any ticket to leave and go to New York was over $1000 that day. They very well knew they would make us miss our connecting flight and the hotel only allow you to stay till 12 PM. I ended up having to pay for another night at the hotel because my flight was not leaving until 8 PM but of course that flight was also delayed. This is their way of operating they made me miss a lot of money for my event on the 24th. I’m very angry about that they made me pay for a hotel. They are liars, they are disrespectful - this is not about you get what you pay for when you offer a service you’re supposed to accommodate your customers and honor the promises that you’ve made to them they do not care about us they just want our money when I got to the hotel to hotel basically told me that they are usually booked more than half of the people that stay in their hotel are from Spirit Airlines delays. It should not take me two days to get home the people were super disrespectful - they actually argued with us when we had to stand up for over five hours on lines being taken upstairs and then downstairs and upstairs this is ridiculousr.",-1

Rude people, horrible seats and if your over their 40lbs limit on luggage they charge you an additional 71.00 or you can take your items out to be under the 40 lb limit which still makes no sense because your still bringing the extra weight on the plane. They are always delayed or cancel your flights for no good reason. Do not fly with them, it’s worth it to pay a little more and be with a better airline.",-1

My children contracted COVID before my flight I contacted spirit airlines an they were rude as well as insensitive. I did everything that they required as far as uploading my proper documents and they left me in limbo. Call them every day two or 3 times a day with hours long hold time. Everybody across the world knows that if you contact or are in contact with someone who test positive for covid-19 you have to quarantine it is not as if I just deliberately canceled my flight who expects that they are going to contract COVID-19 after all that time and the run around they put me through for 30 days they gave me a flight credit that I have to use within 60 to fly where I have no place to travel to within 60. I do not travel like that I contacted the CEO  to get a a senseless response of after my flight credit expires in 60 days go through the same endless steps to get another 6 months flight credit once again I have no place to travel to but I guess they are doing that bad to basically strong arm a single parent out of $191.00. I totally understand that they have procedures however I guess I was supposed to come to the airport and risk everybody else with this deadly infection.,-1

They change your days without notice or options other than to cancel. Try to charge you for every little bit they can. I spoke with two supervisors, one never called back and the other was extremely incompetent. I got no resolution, no options. They wasted my time and money big time. The worst part is not the price or charges but the customer service, they only care for money no customers saying is part of the policy but will never even try to make it up in any way.",-1

I arrived at 3:45 AM and was asked to joined a line that was so long that it wrapped around side and back of check in counter… after an hour of waiting I was made my way to get my bag tag then back on line. At 5:10 the start announcing last call for my flight and many people flocked the counter when I got to the representative spilled a cup of tea and he got furious. He went to the back to get papers to clean up my mess. I apologize profusely. He then looked at is time and told me “you are not getting on that flight” He said “you need to go deal with customer service to be rebooked”. I called service and waited 2 hours without anyone picking up the phone. I also joined the chat line that took 1 hours before someone responded. The chat went on for 1:30 hour with long wait time in between responses. I eventually got so frustrated I had To purchase new ticket on a different airline because I had to get to my wedding. There is no service department to help you or guide you in these circumstances.,-1

Then when I received the email it was only the amount I paid for baggage, a small portion of the charges.

The flight was changed 2 times the second time is was a flight I couldn't make due to work schedule. I went on Spirit.com and canceled the flight and waited about 2 weeks and found another flight that suited my needs. I rebooked my trip only to find out today that my flight was rescheduled again. I called a representative and asked them for a refund and they flat out refused. This is totally unacceptable.

This seat was worse than the departure flight, to makes matters worse I sat next to a guy who was 500lbs and clearly too big for the seat and he didn't pay anything.

After we received the news, we talked to a manager  who provided great service. She worked with us and made sure we were good. Since we traveled with 2 adults and 4 children, we had to split to make it easier for us to find a different flight he same same day. Myself and my 2 older children flew out of the Ft Lauderdale airport, but my wife had to catch a plane with my younger 2 children from a different airport. Genesis provided her with a Lyft, she gave us vouchers to eat at the airport. Even though we are still annoyed about our flight being canceled, and the fact that we have to land at different airports and then find a way to our cars at phl airport, we had to acknowledge that this women and her staff provided excellent service.

Luckily we got a very nice agent and we were able to leave as stand-by’s. Not only did we miss our flight over 100+ did and it was such big chaos and no organization at all.

However, all flights were canceled, I was scared my flight was going to be canceled and I booked a another departure flight through AA. But I still left my return flight coming back through Santo Domingo on Spirit which I call the flight from hell. I paid $1026 for two one way tickets and paid extra for whatever services they offered. First of all this airline counter line was 1 hour and 20 minutes long just to drop, at that rate with each customer the flight was delayed by two hours which made everyone miss their connecting flights in Fort Lauderdale. When we got to Ft. Lauderdale no one at the Spirit desk could tell you exactly where to go. They would make you stand in line and once you reached the counter they would tell you to go somewhere else. I stood in 3 different lines and the counter workers were rude and didn’t want to help. By the time I was able to get the new tickets printed it was only 20 minutes left to get through TSA and to get to my gate. This was my second time traveling with this airline and I have promised myself that even if this was the only airline travelling I would not purchase a single flight.",-1
2021-08-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Columbus,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,nothing but frustration,True,"  I would just like to express my disdain for Spirit Airlines as they continue to show they do not really care about their customers. I live in Columbus, OH and am from Orlando, FL, so to fly home conveniently, my options are limited as Columbus is a smallish airport and Spirit seems to be the only airline with a direct flight every day from Columbus to Orlando or vice versa (Allegiant and Frontier only fly certain limited days). Last week, like many, my flight from Orlando to Columbus on Spirit was cancelled. Yes, they gave us a refund, and fortunately we were able to catch a flight on a different airline, albeit 12 hours later. Spirit ""gifted"" us each (me and my dad were flying back) a $50 voucher to use on another flight. Since I travel monthly between Columbus and Orlando, I proceeded to book a one-way flight from Orlando to Columbus for next week (I go tomorrow from Columbus to Orlando on a different airline). Naturally, I chose a $43 flight home to Columbus, which ended up being about $90 due to me needing a carry-on. I thought perfect, I'll use my voucher, but of course it did not work. Annoyed by this and a message stating that this flight was ""restricted"" and I was unable to use the voucher, I called Spirit and remained on the line forever. This isn't about the money, $90 is fine for a flight, but if I have this voucher, I want to use it and since Spirit put a 12 hour wrench in my plans last week, I think its the least they could do. I finally get some poor dude on the phone and proceed to explain the situation. After giving him my voucher number, he proceeds to tell me that I cannot redeem the voucher on this trip. By this point I am totally confused as I believe I am someone who can read, and the email clearly states: ""Your voucher credit is redeemable for trips booked by the expiration date on any flight available in the system."" Now this person proceeds to tell me this flight is too low cost for the voucher to be used and that I can book on a later flight that day. Keep in mind, this flight he is suggesting is not direct, will take me like 6 hours instead of 2, and is $100 more expensive, basically rendering my voucher useless. I proceed to read him the email and ask him, how am I supposed to know what flights this voucher works for, as it says all flights, but clearly that is an actual lie. Thanks Spirit, for nothing but frustration.",-1

Then it was changed to 10:30pm and then to 11pm, i have a child with Anxiety, Autism that wants to go home she is tired and hungry. We have been in the airport since 5pm and is not fair to us as passenger to be out through this inconvenience. The employees are the worse, and when you have an issue with the flight you can only talk to them via whatsapp. What kind of airline is this. They don’t give you nothing to drink or a snack They charge you for everything.

Many extra charges hidden, that by the time we pay all of them, would have been as if we got a ticket on United or Delta. The attitude of all their personnel is so poor, unwilling to help. Our plane was delayed due to a medical emergency, and as a consequence, we missed our connection flight and ended up stranded in Dallas. Well, these people knew that almost 1/3 of their plane was going to Atlanta, and that we were missing the connection. Anyhow, knowing that, as soon as we arrived, they took our luggage and sent it to Atlanta, but left us passengers in Dallas, with no flight, no luggage and no help. These people were not willing to try to help us find a connection flight, nor give us at least a toiletry bag so we could spend the night. Of course, they did not want to pay for overnight hotel, and with an attitude told us to sleep in the airport. Unprofessional, rude, with the worst attitude. Never again.

This airline is going to fail to get you where you need to go when they say they will. I thought it would be a convenient airline, but it wasn't. You're better off driving. My first flight was delayed an hour, which was annoying but not the end of the world. The return flight was cancelled because the organization is a mess! So now I have to spend more money to cover for their mishaps. Just don't use Spirit. You'll just end up spending more money to get to where you need to be. Also their customer service was terrible. I got hung up on twice. In short, other airlines are worth the price, Spirit is just going to make you wish you flew with someone else.",-1

Total incompetence, first flight was canceled, had to book with another airline for an international flight 8 hours before boarding. We were told we would be refunded, has been 7 days still not a word. The bag check for the return flight was a complete nightmare, spent hours waiting, nearly missed our flight. Then when we landed at our destination, over half the people on our flight had their luggage lost.

If you think that it is a low cost airline, you are mistaken. With exorbitant fees for checking bags and fees to select your seat, etc. the ultimate price is equal to or greater than a ticket on a more professional airline. The airline and their schedule is very unreliable. Do NOT book with them unless you are prepared to have your scheduled itinerary changed with little notice. Recently, Spirit cancelled my flights to and from Tampa and put me on alternative flights --- with the return flight landing past midnight rather than the originally scheduled mid-afternoon timeframe. Then, trying to change these alternate flights was a nightmare. Spirit's website is VERY unfriendly, and (purposely) misleading. The website asked me to pre-purchase my checked bags ---- failing to note that I had already purchased checked bags when I made the original reservation and any subsequent purchase would be IN ADDITION to the original purchase. Therefore, I ended up paying for TWICE as many checked bags as I needed. I spent well over an hour on a ""chat"" with their ""customer service"" department --- to no avail. And to try to get someone on the phone is impossible.",-1
2021-08-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst airline I ever took,True,  By far the worst airline I ever took. These people were rude and the policy spirit have to where they make you miss you’re flight is unacceptable. These people will never get my service again. First time flying this airline and I will never return.,-1
2021-08-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to La Guardia,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Not comfortable at all,True,  Spirit is the worst airline ever! Be ready they will delay our flight about an hour to a few hours. Always not in time. Not comfortable at all.,-1
2021-08-14,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Las Vegas,3.0,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,very friendly and patient,False,  Danielle at the St. Louis airport check in was very friendly and patient trying to find our flight because our last one we missed. I really appreciate her for trying to help. Customer service like that is what it should always be people are not like her anymore.,-1
2021-08-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,refused to pay for me to stay anywhere,True,  So I had a connecting flight from New York to Chicago with a stop in between in Fort Lauderdale. My flight got so ridiculously delayed to Fort Lauderdale that I missed my flight to Chicago. They booked me for the “next” flight which was at 4 pm the next day. Spirit refused to pay for me to stay anywhere even though there was 16 hours till my flight and wouldn’t even refund me for my flight because “I had already taken part of the flight”. But before I found out about that the customer service agent lied to me and told me I would get a hotel voucher via email when he knew I wouldn’t and then disappeared. So I had to spend $200 to get a flight home with a better airline because there’s not a chance I’m ever flying with Spirit again.,-1
2021-08-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Austin to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,poor scheduling of services,True,  Our plane is still sitting here at the gate and we were supposed to take off 45 minutes ago. The reason we're still sitting here is due to them not having a fuel truck ready. hat did they think the plane was going to fly on?  Not one time have I ever hopped on a Spirit Airlines flight and took off with any incident. This airline should be embarrassed for their mismanagement and poor scheduling of services required to operate an airplane.,-1

If you choose your own seat the price begins at $18, checked bag cheaper than carry on, max weight 40lbs. If you have to check your bag don’t bother checking in on your phone you will have to check in again. There’s no complimentary anything not water and not a snack, no WiFi. Seats are stiff, so small, and the tray is the size of a half a sheet of paper. Bottom line if you were getting a good deal for all of these inconveniences I’d get it but you’re not getting a good deal. Oh and my flight was canceled.",-1

We got to the airport early, flight was boarding was at 6:15, we sat at the terminal for an hour an then was told to go to a different terminal. We sat and stood there another 1 hour, once we boarded the plane we sat there an additional 2 hours then we had to sit an wait for 31 planes to take off before we were able to take flight. I will not refer anyone to this airline.",-1

They delayed more than 3 hours and not a single apology or a cup of water on the flight. They forced me to buy a return ticket if not they wouldn't let me fly and they would keep my money. They said i can get a 100% refund as soon as i land or before 24 hours if I cancel and they only refunded me 40% . They stole items out of my luggage and they say they can't do nothing about it and to go online. You go online and they say to call. You call and they say go to the airport. The airport says to go online.,-1
2021-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Cleveland,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,My flight was delayed,False,  First off on my way to Florida for my wedding all flights was cancelled the day us and our wedding party was supposed to fly out. My flight was delayed. MOH flight cancelled 2xs. On the way back from Florida our flight was delayed we get to the airport and they try to charge us and our children $500 more dollars to get another flight all for my brother to call me while on the plane to tell us that the plane hadn't left and is delayed for 20 more minutes.  I lost my bag in the airport with some very important items in it including my wallet! Luckily someone turned it in.,-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Not worth it at all!,True," I will never fly Spirit again! Canceled my flight and had to wait over an hour to speak to a live person to reschedule. Then when checking in on our flight home, I realized that we paid for checked baggage on the flight to Orlando, but apparently you have to pay again for the flight home! So $180 for checked baggage for the flight home! Outrageous! I could’ve flown a better airline for what I paid for this round trip flight. They don’t even give you a complimentary drink or snack on the plane. I learned the hard way about all of these airlines add ons. Not worth it at all!",-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to New York via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit voided our tickets without notice,True," My wife and I had two round trip tickets. When Spirit canceled the outbound flight less than 24 hours before it was due for take-off I requested a refund using that flight’s number. Fast forward to the day of the return flight (today) and I rudely find out that I no longer have a ticket, despite this flight not being canceled. I did not use the return flight’s number in my refund request, so I thought the return flight tickets were still valid. Evidently, that was not the case, and Spirit voided our tickets without notice. Spirit gave no notice or communication that we no longer had tickets for our return flight. On top of all this, we did not receive a refund for the $100 checked bag fee.",-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Newark via Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst ever experience,False,"  Worst ever experience. They first said the flight was delayed but did not update anything anywhere. After 3 hours of the original departure time they stared the boarding and deplaned again. Did not provide any accommodations, food or beverages. Not even water bottles. The rescheduled for the flight which was 24 hrs later without providing any accommodations. I lost my airpods and the agent did not even care to check and said they did not find anything. Would never recommend to travel with spirit even though it's cheaper than other airlines. Sometimes it can take a toll om you",-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Detroit,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,This was just horrendous,False,  Worst experience ever. My flight got delayed multiple times. They had changed my ticket without even telling me. I had to call customer service just to fix it. I was supposed to arrive at Detroit at 3 pm I didn’t arrive until midnight! This was just horrendous. They barely gave us updates. It was just terrible.,-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,customer service is very poor,False,  Not worth the time or money. After 2 canceled trips and a delay we finally got to our destination. The customer service is very poor. It’s worth paying the extra to fly on another airline. You would think they would want to compensate people to make them want to give them a second chance. Nope!!,-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to San Juan,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,They should be shut down,False,"  I much rather pay a few extra bucks to fly with Jet blue or any other airline than to buy a cheaper flight with Spirit only to end up paying for every single thing and only have it add up to way more than any other ticket I could have gotten. Not only that but my flight got cancelled last minute and they wouldn't give me another option but to leave 3 days later than my regular departure date. I had no money and I was stuck with my son out there. Not only that but I had to be home before my finals in school and now I have to repeat my class because of this airline. Not to mention the flight they were trying to give me, would of had a layover in Florida for 6 hours. I ended up having to call family members and pay about 600$ for a last minute flight just to be able to get home.  They should be shut down.",-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,do not fly with this airline,True,"  Worst airline. They cancelled my flight, put me on a new flight, lost my bags, still missing my bags after 3 days, no one has any answers or answers the phone - do not fly with this airline.",-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,delay after delays!,True,"  Rude flight attendants, rude staff at check in, horribly long check baggage lines and lack of pilots and delay after delays! Like a cheap casino they nickel and dime you and at end you end up paying more than an actual airline. This crazy airline needs to be put to sleep and not be allowed to enter the skies.",-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Fort Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,you receive a very low quality service,False,"  I had a round trip ticket from Philadelphia to Los Angeles. The flight from Philadelphia to LAX was ok, but on the return our flight had a 2 hour delay which caused me and about 20 other passengers arriving to the FLL airport about 20 minutes before our flight. However when we arrived at the gate, about 8 minutes before the departing time we were told that our flight had left. The next flight to Philadelphia was 14 hours later. The Customer service was awful and nobody cared. At the Customer service I found a big crowd on different routes that had missed their flights for similar issues. I have travelled with many different airlines and have not seen any airline with such an irresponsible and careless attitude. I even found out the airline charges for carry on and lots of other stuff. In the end you end up paying more than other airlines and in return you receive a very low quality service. Do not fly this airline if you have an option.",-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Atlantic city via Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,flights for the following day were canceled,True,"  I travelled with Spirit Airlines for the 1st time in my life. Spirit Airlines  scheduled a flight that will arrived after my next flight will depart, so when I arrived at my 1st and only suppose stop over the flight was gone more than 3omins before I landed. The agent nonchalantly booked me on another flight with 2 stops and made me arrived at my destination late in the night. 7hours after. Then even though I checked with 2 agents in the airport about my luggage and I was assured that its already on my flight I did not get my luggage when I got to Atlantic city. I have to go back to the airport in the morning even though I did not get to my hotel till 2am. and did remember to say there were no one in the airport from spirit to ask about what to do. Even though I filled a loss baggage report I did not hear back from spirit until I was on my way back to the airport to ask about my baggage. Then at 11pm I got a message that my flights for the following day were canceled from Atlantic city to Atlanta with no alternative. then another text to tell me that its almost time to board for my flight in Atlanta, how spirit wants me to get there I don’t know.",-1

Spirit is a scam, pay double, but do not fly with Spirit if you don't hate yourself. Only a few hours before my 8pm flight, on a Sunday, they decided to send me an email and let me know they had cancelled my flight for no apparent reason. I had to be back in Los Angeles Monday 8am for work, and all other airlines were full. Spirit was rude enough to reimburse me only 25% of what I paid for the roundtrip. After hours of searching, I finally found a car rental that still had a couple of awful cars available for rent, so I paid $400 (including full tank gas for $70) to drive, 7 hours in horrible traffic, to Los Angeles to not miss my Monday morning business meeting.",-1
2021-08-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,another horrible experience,False,"  Again another horrible experience with Spirit from Ft Lauderdale to Tampa, it just keeps on continuing. First the employees go on a strike that the company won't admit putting customers all around the world to be put out and stranded. Not only that but the plane is delayed again in Ft Lauderdale this is putting me back in Tampa after midnight tonight at least I will get home tonight. People please don't fly Spirit they are irresponsible stranding passengers across the country and they are acting like they don't care at all. In fact they are threatening to throw you out of you complain. What a experience listen don't fly Spirit Airlines there are many out there that care about their customers.",-1
2021-08-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cancun,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,you are no longer our issue,False,"  I was affected by this “operational challenge” which really means “our pilots are on strike since spirit isn’t paying us enough, and working us to the ground” and in return they are canceling thousands of flights. I was offered a refund for my fight and to go home or to see if spirit can find a similar round trip flight with another airline. We chose the second option. After 5 hours of standing in line we got confirmation that United Airlines had a flight available for us. We went to United only to be told that the confirmation numbers are invalid and Spirit has been doing this all day to just get their customers away from the desk. We walked back to spirit and then we’re told “since we already helped you find a flight you are no longer our issue and you need to speak with United Airlines, we cannot help you”. So back to United we went. This time spoke with a different rep who was phenomenal and was able to do some calling around. She was able to find the reserved seats by spirit but we could not get boarding passes until the finds were released. We spoke to Spirit and we’re told they released the funds and that United did not know what they were doing and if they still do not have the funds for us to pay United and Spirit will reimburse. Here we are fast forward our return from Cancun. I have been on the phone for over 6 hours trying to get a reimbursement, and have been told I’m sorry unfortunately we cannot refund you that much…..please email the help desk to see if they can further assist you. So I did and the turn around time is 2-3 months . I do not understand how I was told to pay for the flight and spirit would reimburse but now almost $6000 later in fights I am turned away.",-1
2021-08-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Ft Lauderdale via Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst ever experience,False,  Worst ever experience. Not only did they cancel flight to Detroit they offered no help and only refunded 1/2 our money. The the return flight to Ft Lauderdale then to Tampa. That flight was 1/2 full and the crew made us sit three across and 1/2 the seats in the plane were empty. The crew would not let us social distance even though covid is wild in Florida and raging nationwide. Even two complete exit rows completely empty with unmanned exit doors definitely a safety issue. When volunteering to move to the exit door to man was told that seat costs extra money if I want to help others be safe in an accident.,-1
2021-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montego bay to Kansas City via Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,We were lied to,True,"  We were lied to about waiting for our flight before it was cancelled. We were then sent to wait for over an hour in a line to receive further assistance while the remaining spirit staff stared at us. At this point we realized that their staff was on strike by looking up local news on our phones. Others in line mentioned they were already stranded since the night before. Because of this we had to book elsewhere. All flights were full from this airport so we had to get a rental car, drive it to Orlando and book a flight through another airline. We have a letter showing crew as the reason for cancelled flight. I have contacted customer support and they could only offer a refund of partial amount of flight without giving an amount. The email us a complaint link gives a 403 error on spirit.com. lastly we filed a request for refund support using chat but this was all automated and ended saying they will see if our flight cancellation is eligible for refund; yet again no way to see amounts. So we might get a refund when we lost 24 hours and spent more to get home, and we were the lucky ones compared to others in line.",-1
2021-08-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Cancun,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,the lack of effort to make things right is the reason for the review,False,"  Tried to save $100, ended up costing me about $800. I can't complain about the flight itself, at least the one that got me to Cancun. The return flight was canceled. They re-booked the flight for the next day and did put me up in a hotel, also gave me a meal voucher (about $13, thanks). They also sent an email for a $50 flight voucher that expired in less than 2 months, really? Don't go out of your way. Back to the airport, next day, that flight canceled also. Evidently there was a strike going on. Maybe their fault maybe not, but if the employees are not happy the customers will not be either. (35 years in the restaurant business). They did offer to put me up in the hotel again, but I had to get back. No offer to put me on a different carrier, only to refund my money ($160). The flight I had to book 1 way cost $400 and had a 13 hr lay-over so another day lost there. Again, maybe their fault maybe not, but the lack of effort to make things right is the reason for the review.",-1

The cheaper price is a scam. 65 dollars for carry on both ways. No free water or snacks of any kind. Uncomfortable seats.,-1
2021-08-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Tampa,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Absolutely horrible customer service,False,  Absolutely horrible customer service! I received an email stating the flight was on time. And it was everything but on time. It was actually canceled and my son and I was told that there is nothing they can do. They refunded me less than half of the flight cost and pretty much told me there is nothing they can do and to get out of their line. My son and have been stuck in the airport for a little over 22 hours now. I had to purchase new flights for us through Allegiant Air which cost me $512 to get us home. So a round trip flight that was suppose to be around $300 has now cost me around $700. Not to mention the money my family has lost on a lager project I was suppose to be at this morning.,-1

First, they charge $65 per carry-on bag. The flight got delayed because they didn't have a plane, and when the plane arrived they didn't have crew members. Horrible experience. Ended up with a two hour delay. Simply do not fly with them, its not worth it.",-1
2021-08-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Diego,,,,,,,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,"  Worst experience ever. Flights got canceled more than once. Then again and again. Lost reservations and activities scheduled in San Diego for my entire family. Stay away from this clowns. I had to fly with United in order to salvage some of my vacation trip. Spirit so called customer service is trash, literally had to wait more than 4 hours and the chat option is a lie. Once they finally connect after 2 hours or more the connection times out and they simply end the chat and you have to re start the chat just to end up with zero customer service.",-1
2021-08-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to San Juan,,,,,,,1.0,I could not board my weekend flight,False,"  The July-August 2021 travel disaster that Spirit airline unleashed on unexpecting passengers is unforgiveable. They cancelled over 350 of their domestic and international flights within a weekend! They left passengers stranded abroad and at domestic airports and provided no customer service assistance. Passengers had to pay for their own hotel stay and find another airline carrier to take them to their final destination. Spirit Airlines does not and will not book its passengers on flights with other airlines. My cousin got stranded in Jamaica and I could not board my weekend flight to San Juan after sacrificing a lot just to have that weekend off to surprise my friend who has been going through a lot of emotional anguish. To make matters worse, the airline is taking measures to not have to refund passengers for flights that they cancelled! How can Spirit expect its customers to trust them enough to rebook another ticket within 60 days after going through travel hell with this airline?",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Fort Lauderdale via Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst airline ever,False,"  I will keep it short. Delays, delays. Cancellations.

2021-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,disgrace to the airline industry,False,"  I am currently active duty military. As most of you know we do not get very many opportunities to get a chance to come home and see our families or significant others. My flight was canceled today 08/05/2021 because of a “systems issue” where my flight and thousands of others are out good money that I’m sure they work very hard for. My flight was later listed, the exact same flight after mine was canceled for a whopping $550 after I paid $125 in mid July. This airline is simply nothing but a money grabbing scam.  Spirit is a disgrace to the airline industry and I will never fly with them ever again.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Pittsburgh via Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,do not care about the customers,True,"  Never flying with this airline again. They do not care about the customers. I was supposed to fly out of Las Vegas on a Sunday at 11pm. When the boarding time came around they announced that they did not have a plane for us because the flight that was supposed to come was cancelled so they just never sent a plane for us. They said the flight would be delayed and would update us when they could but had no time estimate to give us. Fast forward to 2 hours later, I as well as a couple other people on the same flight as me get a notification on our phones from sprint that our flight was cancelled. No one had came up and told us that it was cancelled it was the app that told us. I was furious. I went downstairs to their desk to find a line the entire length of the airport entrance. As I was waiting in line some of the workers were coming around and taking questions. Three different workers told us different things each time. One told us we’d get help with a hotel, a meal voucher, and an email with a new flight. The next worker said other people were just buying new flights with different airlines and said it would be best to do that. The last worker said they were not helping at all with any hotels, had no info for any hotels around, and it’d be several hours before we received an email for a new flight. The worker then said waiting in line is a waste of time and I just have to wait. Finally I get to the halfway point in the line where 2 workers were standing and she asks what flight I was on, and she immediately says “okay well we’re not dealing with that flight anymore tonight” and moves past me to the next person like what... my mouth dropped. So I have to sleep in this airport (other people had tried hotels in the area and all were booked it was a big weekend in Vegas for events) and find a new flight which happened to be 800 dollars... now we can fast forward to the following night when I finally arrived home through another airline, I end up getting an email for a meal voucher from spirit for $20... almost 24 hours later they want to feed me. To this day I still never received the email to help with a flight. I have so many problems with this whole situation. The fact that they didn’t cancel until 2 hours past the departure time when they knew they didn’t have a plane and the lack of help and rudeness from the staff.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,Never fly with them,True,"  I have flown with Spirit many of times and never had a complaint about them, though I’ve heard many complaints from other people (who are to me a little bit more spoiled on how they need to travel), but this experience will forever put a bad taste in my mouth. I planned an entire trip for my mother and I around their flights and they cancel five hours before my flight so now all other ticket prices are double what I originally paid. After fighting for another ticket with only four seats left on the flight and paying double, they were “kind” enough to give me a $50 voucher for the both of us! How will that help me? A $269 flight I’m now paying over $600 for and your $100 credit for another of your flights is supposed to help me? Never fly with them. And they knew something was up too, because they warned me to check my flight before leaving because of “high demand”.  I almost missed my cousin’s wedding, and even now spending that much money puts a horrible taste in my mouth! The worst domestic experience I’ve ever had; I’ve flown with over a dozen different airlines world wide, and have been subjected to a 24 hour layover cancellation with jet blue! This takes the cake.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chicago,,,,,,,1.0,Spirit had horrible communication,True,  Spirit had horrible communication when it came to canceling me and my 12yrs old flight within 2 hours of departure. Getting a live representative on the phone is impossible. Still no word on reimbursement for flight missed. A flight credit will not help the time missed from work or the expense of a flight home with different airlines. I recommend to never use Spirit Airlines again.,-1

I am waiting for the 12:15 AM flight now. After complaining, agent asked me if I was going to Dallas anyway. This is an airline that should be eliminated immediately. It's the worst airline.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Fort Myers,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never to fly with Spirit Airlines,True,  Flight 1655 to RWS was delayed several times beginning on Sunday morning and was finally rescheduled for the next day at 7:00 am. They knew full and well it was going to be cancelled but had everyone come back in through security and go through all that hassle again the next day only to finally cancel our flight. No communication from employees. Our family vacation was ruined and we were out a bunch of money from not showing up to Airbnb. So much stress trying to cancel car rentals and receive a refund for what I could. What should have been a relaxing and enjoyable beach vacation turned into a disaster. My kids were devastated as were many other kids and family waiting in the airport. Never again will we try to fly Spirit.

They messed up my vacation and my and putt me through a huge problem with my job. They do not care I was supposed to leave Today and they don’t have no more flights until the 13 August. Now I have to buy a very expensive ticket with another airline. Hideous experience, please do not use this airline.",-1
2021-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Atlanta,,,,,,,1.0,had our flights cancelled twice,False,"  Worst experience ever. I will never fly on Spirit again. They don't give any explanation for flights cancellation and don't have the needed staff to help. We had our flights cancelled twice. We hope we can get a full refund without any inconvenience since it was not us who canceled. Don't ever get a cheap flight again, specifically from Spirit, you will regret it.",-1
2021-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,email saying our flight was canceled,False,  At 1:00 A.M. in the morning when me and my family were all asleep we got an email saying our flight was canceled. They then tried to book us a few days later but we told them no. We told them that we needed to be back home as soon as possible.  The reason they was because they over booked the staff. Also to add a cherry on top of the cake I was on hold for 2 hours with Spirits customer support and my mom was on hold for an hour. Have I learned anything from this experience? Never fly Spirit.,-1

They then hung up on us and we waited for 2 hours before it was canceled. After it was canceled we waited in another line for 8 hours just to reschedule our flight and when we rescheduled our flight the worker was very rude. I will never fly Spirit again.,-1
2021-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,No help or assistance,True," First time flying with Spirit. Flight was from ORD to LAX round trip. Flight out was delayed by 1 hour. Flight returned was cancelled at 2.32am for a 9.54 flight. The only option for same day out was flying on another airline for 4 times the cost of my original ticket home. I will never fly Spirit again. Lesson learned for going with the cheaper option. Cost me way more in the long run. Contacted customer service for Spirit and their only option for a next flight was 2 days later. They did refund flight home ticket price and gave me a worthless $50 Flight voucher that I had to use within 2 months. No additional compensation to cover my additional expenses. Asked for future Flight credits, additional refunds, and/or food vouchers. No help or assistance. Stay away from this company if you want peace of mind that you can get to and from where you want to go.",-1
2021-08-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,we had to wait for more than 10 hours,False,"  There is so much I would like to Express in this review, however I will just say that the experience I had to endure by flying in Spirit last Sunday 1, 2021, is the worst that I have ever lived in more than 40 years of flying. It’s not only the worst airline I’ve ever flown on, but their people, their staff, the human beings that work for it, are by far, the most evil I have ever met. They delayed our flight (NK 405) several times, so we had to wait for more than 10 hours to finally be told the flight would not leave. We had to stay overnight at the airport under the worst conditions. Spirit didn’t supply anything, not even a bottle of water or an apology. As if it wasn’t bad enough, there wasn’t any explanation or alternative for the pax. Everyone was on their own. No hotel, no meals, no new tickets, no money back. We went through hell, literally. Who responds for all this?",-1
2021-08-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1.0,don’t ever choose Spirit Airlines,True," If you are not really short with the money, don’t ever choose Spirit Airlines. My flight was on August 3rd at 5.20pm, and I received the email on the same day at 8am telling me my flight was cancelled and with no option of reschedule. Calling the customer services, no answer at all. Do the live chat. Only option is refund and that’s it. I really suggest if you really not short of the money, choose Delta or another big company!",-1
2021-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Portland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Changed our flight the day of with zero notification,False,"  Horrid company. Changed our flight the day of with zero notification. Cost us well over 1000 dollars extra to rent a car and drive home. Horrible company, poor customer service. Avoid flying with them at all cost. Matter of fact if you calculate all the baggage fees and your money ahead, fly a reputable airline for the extra cost. Spirit is the only airline I've ever booked with, never set foot on a plane, and the only airline that has ever screwed me over.",-1

Mind you, I was already on my way to the airport when I received this message. I still went to the airport to find another flight, and after checking with 5 other airlines, there were none. I even checked for different days to fly but there were no reasonable nor affordable options, such as 25 hour layovers at 1k per person for a one-way trip. I am now on my way home and the resort is charging me in full. But hey, thanks for the $50 voucher, Spirit! Never again. This was the 2nd time I booked with Spirit to 2 different destinations, and both round trip flights were cancelled. Do not take the risk. I honestly am questioning how this airline is still even operating.",-1

Could not get a hold of customer service and no refund. Next available flight >48 hours from my original flight.

Could not get a hold of customer service. Tried countless times over the course of 9 hours. Messaged them on Whatsapp as I was instructed and told them I would like a refund. I get an email 9 hours later saying that I was put on a Delta flight that had a 5 hour layover for what should be a 2 hour flight. Called and asked to cancel this comically inconvenient flight which I did not ask for. I messaged multiple times that I would rather have a refund. Finally got a hold of a rep who said that they could not cancel it since it was a different airline and they could not refund me. Put me on hold for 77 minutes to speak to a manager who then offered me a $50 voucher to fly on Spirit. I would rather walk from Chicago to New Orleans than deal with Spirit again.,-1

Not taking into account of what people have going on or why they even picked the original time to fly. This is my second time flying Spirit and I thought I’d give them a second chance and my both flights have been delayed for hours and one was even canceled. It is the worst airline.,-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Ft Lauderdale via St Thomas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I was told to sit down multiple times,False,  I was kidnapped by Spirit Airlines on August 1st 2021. I received a message that the connecting flight was canceled. I tried to exit the plane. I was told to sit down multiple times. I was sent to Ft Lauderdale against my will. I stood in line for 13 hrs before I spoke with someone. I made my own way back to Dallas after spending more of my own money. Losing money for a rental and airbnb in St Thomas. For Spirit to continue to charge me for the flight I was kidnapped on is beyond me. It was my first time flying Spirit.,-1

Spirit cancelled my flight the day of our flight out of Tampa with no excuse and did not even off to help to find us another flight. Spirit offered nothing, just flight is canceled. After, hours of searching we found another airline to get us home at almost triple the cost. Minutes before boarding our new flight home to another airport I received an email stating they were going to give us each a $50 voucher towards another flight good for 2 weeks. We didn’t cancel the flight so why would you think it’s even legal to keep our $. They left us stranded, zero customer service, zero customer communication, zero business professionalism and absolutely zero class.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orange County to Seattle via las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,cancelling flights nationwide,True,"  Spirit is cancelling flights nationwide due to their ""operational challenges."" Don't sell tickets of there aren't enough employees to staff the flight. I was abandoned with hundreds of other passengers and given a choice to take the next flight 2 days later or get a credit (does it appear I want to fly Spirit again?) or get a refund and book elsewhere. While I paid under a hundred dollars, now I'm being squeezed to buy a last minute ticket for hundreds of dollars. There's no recourse for Spirit management making poor planning decisions. Spirit has turned their mistake into someone else's problem. I'm at a loss that this keeps happening to consumers. After thousands of reviews, you can see how Spirit doesn't care about passengers or its reputation.",-1

Absolutely worthless company. No customer service by phone, chat or text. Please be smart and go with any other airline as there is a high likelihood of you getting burned. So far, 2/2 experiences were horrific and time-consuming, not to mention the lost money. I wish there was the option to rate a zero.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Cleveland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit delayed my round trip flight,False,"  Spirit delayed my round trip flight, both ways are changed from 6pm departure to 11pm (red eye flight). I click on their ONLINE CHAT service, spent time back and forth, and when I chose to get refund, suddenly, their customer service are busy, please use our whatsapp services. Pick up my cell phone, whatsapp Spirit, same thing, after back and forth message, right where I chose fund, suddenly, they are busy, someone will contact you, that someone never called so we are stuck with the redeye flight. This is my last time flying Spirit. It is worth every dime to fly with a better quality airline. Oh and when I tried to summit a complaint on Spirit's website, it never went through, 30 minutes later, it is still processing.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,canceled last minute due to no crew,False,  My family and I were supposed to be flying to Florida on 8/1/21. Our flight was canceled last minute due to “no crew”. The next day we were supposed to fly out and they once again cancelled our flight last minute. We have been trying to get ahold of someone for 6 hours and have not been able to get anyone. They disconnected us after waiting for hours. Their text service has gone dead as well. Now we are two days behind on our family vacation and have no faith in getting to or coming back with this false airline. We have now had to spend double what we spend initially to get a real airline to take us to our destination. Horrible company I wish they didn’t even get the one star they make you give when rating this is a huge over shot on the actual airline.,-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Boston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,book any other airline,False,"  My flight got delayed 6 times within 10 hours. After 10 hour delay, the airline cancelled the flight. For each delay and the cancellation there was no public announcement of the delay or cancellation from anyone. There was no agent available to answer any questions or provide guidance during all the delays and not even after it got cancelled. Not one person that works for Spirit was available to guide anyone the entire time. I can’t say bad customer service because there was no service to start with. I wouldn’t take this airline for free in the future. Please save yourself the trouble and money and book any other airline in the world.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,Do not book Spirit Airlines,True,"  Booked flight for my godchild from Detroit to Fort Lauderdale and back. On return trip on 7/31/2021, used the Kiosk to check in luggage and then wait 2 1/2 hours in line to drop off luggage. After 8 hours, flight gets canceled, rebooted the next day, and had my godchild leave her luggage since we didn't want to wait 2 1/2 hours to drop off luggage again Today. Today, 8/01/2021, dropped her off at airport again, after 12 hours, she is still waiting on her rebooked flight since it has been delayed. Spirit causes its own issues, can't handle the amount of travelers and just makes their customers mad. Do not book Spirit Airlines for any flights thru Fort Lauderdale. Lessons learned for us.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Detroit,,,,,,,1.0,cancelled at the last minute,False,"  Never book with Spirit Airline.  This was my first time booking with Spirit. My flight was cancelled at the last minute. no contact can be reached. No refund or rebook was offered or available. No representative can be reached. Stayed on hold with the company for several hours only to be hung up on repeatedly by the answering service.  They took my credit card info, charged my account, and kept my money. Have had to cancel all my other flights and hotels and am heading home.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando,4.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit Airlines,True,"  We travel a lot. This was our first time trying Spirit. We booked trying to save a few bucks for a quick trip to Orlando. Direct flight on the way down and they lost my checked bag. Didn’t get it till 2 days later on only a 3 day trip. Ready to come home we waited over an hour just for bag drop. Got to gate, was told their was no crew for flight and had to wait. Two hours later they canceled the flight. Instead of helping everyone at that gate we had to return to ticket counter to try and get it sorted and baggage claim to get bags back. Everyone mad dashed to get in line to be told after waiting to go to another counter. Then they did the same thing again at other counter. Spent $3k on last minute flights with another airline just to get home. Spirit was not willing to do anything additional to make the issue right. When I did finally get ahold of someone the most I got was money back for my one flight and even that was a flight. I learned my lesson and would tell you to never fly Spirit Airlines!",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cartagena to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,customer support is horrendous,True,"  I am based out of the US, and I booked an international flight using Spirit since it was much cheaper than the other major airlines, so I figured I would try them out. Outbound was delayed by six hours, but I eventually got to my destination. Delays happen, I wasn't going to post a negative review just for that. Going back to the US after my vacation was up was the major problem. Four hours before departure, I get an email from Spirit that my flight has been canceled. I didn't leave for the airport yet, so I tried to get in touch with Spirit support to see what they would do for me to help me get back to my home country. I first tried to modify my flight on their website for the next available outbound, but the page kept error'ing out. I then dialed into their 801 Utah number, but after 60 minutes on hold, dialing internationally mind you which is not inexpensive, I eventually hung up. I then messaged them on whatsapp, and got a quick auto-reply that someone would get back to me later in the day. Later in the day?! That did not sound acceptable, but there are no other options to contact Spirit. About an hour later, Spirit support messaged me back on whatsapp to say that I qualified for two options: a reservation credit with a $50 voucher, or a refund for my return flight. I reminded them that I was in an international location, about to be kicked out of my hotel room, and since Spirit canceled my flight, I asked why they could not rebook me on their next available flight. Spirit simply told me these were the only options available to me. So, Spirit completely abandoned me in a foreign country. I looked on Spirit's website for a new outbound where I could possibly use the credit, but the next available flight was now 2 days out. I asked Spirit for a refund on my return flight, which he said he would start to process. It is later in the day, so other airlines at this point do not have same day flight options. I booked another night in the hotel, have to pay to take a new COVID test as my previous one was at 3 days as of the time of my original flight, spent an hour on an international phone call which yielded me no results, and have just booked a new flight on another airline for the next day, for $1,300. I thought I would save money by using Spirit for an international flight, but after they canceled my flight and didn't bother to book me on another one, all the other expenses I am now facing completely wrecked my finances. Spirit is not on the hook for any of this. Is this even legal? Can a US based airline really just abandon you in a foreign country without any recourse? Spirit, you are a terrible airline, and your customer support is horrendous. Shame on you. I will never fly on your airline again.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,airline has no integrity whatsoever,True,"  This airline has no integrity whatsoever. They obscure information, make the booking process as difficult as possible, and take as much money from you as they can. We booked a flight with them in July, 2021, and needed to make some changes to the flight one week before we flew. Not only were we given different information about how to go about this from *every* staff member with whom we spoke on the phone, but we were also charged an inordinate amount of money for the flight change, more than twice what we would have paid to simply book a new flight. When we asked for the agent not to process the booking after all (due to unclear information and us not understanding what we were being charged for), she promptly told us that the payment had already gone through and that it could not be refunded. We asked to speak to a supervisor and waited on the phone for 45 minutes before we reached a human. The supervisor also refused to help us and we ended up wasting a huge amount of money and time on this so-called 'budget' airline. I would definitely recommend avoiding Spirit Airlines at all costs.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to New York,,,,,,1.0,1.0,pilot never showed up for work,False,"  I will never fly this airline again! We got to the airport, everything was going smooth and we walk in to see only our flight at 4:14pm was canceled out of all of the other ones flying to NY. we thought this was kind of strange considering the weather was fine in both Nashville and New York. We waited on a line for 3.5 hours with over 300 people waiting. There were only 3 employees from spirit talking to the customers. Come to find out the flight is canceled because the pilot never showed up for work today. You don’t have a backup pilot?  They didn’t even work with us. They told us there’s nothing they can do and we have to wait for the next available flight to go home. This is an atrocious airline and I personally will never be associated with them ever again. Spend the extra money and get a reliable flight with people who actually show up and know what they’re doing.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,"San Juan to Tampa, Florida",3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,They took off and left me in Puerto Rico,False,  Worst airline ever. I am 90 years old and was on a wheelchair under Spirit care. They change the flight departure time back and forth. Also they change boarding gates. They took off and left me in Puerto Rico. My son had to come back and pick me up. Next day there were all kinds of fights at their desk where they have to call the police.,-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Minneapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never use or recommend ever again,False,"  Horrible airline, sitting in airport because of a 3 hrs delay, I like how they alert me after I'm at the airport so I have to wait there for 5hrs. Then there is nowhere to sit or wait cause the airline packs everyone in a small area to stand. I hate Spirit airlines will never use or recommend ever again. Never had any problems on delta like I have had here.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,The agent refused to listen to me,False,"  Second worst experience ever! First time flying they made me pay for my personal item and threaten to not allow me to board if I didn’t pay for my purse. I paid and called to file a complaint and they never refunded me my money. I decided to give them another shot this year to fly to Florida on Aug 20th. I now have an emergency surgery, not being about to walk and stand and nor will I be able to fly the rest of the year! The agent refused to listen to me and said there is nothing they can do but credit the account for $77 dollars after I paid $245 on the ticket! I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor, I was told “no” at least three times before she placed me on hold for over an hour! All I want is a full refund because of medical reasons.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Tampa,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,will never fly this airline again,True,"  My return flight was cancelled via text which directed me to Spirit page to manage the cancellation. This page gave me zero options to remedy the issue, so I called and no agent answered after a 20 min hold . Arrived at Tampa Airport 3 hrs before flight and learned that 145 passengers’ flights were cancelled and we had 2 options: refund or book on next day flight. We had to return to work so took refund; in the meantime the manager approached and tells us there was an email error; this is their mistake and will rebook us today . Thought we were good but because they refunded us couldn’t get rebooked so we had to book ourselves with another airline and pay $300 more for our tickets . Everyone else on the flight had the option to rebook without the additional charges, but because we arrived early before Spirit agents had their act together we paid the price. We will never fly this airline again for this reason not to mention this is not a budget airline as I am surprised I didn’t have to pay for my own air on the plane. Never again Spirit.",-1

Sat & sat then an announcement that they were waiting for a 1st officer. 16 minutes later flight canceled no warning. Then found out they cancelled 5 other flights. No customer service at all.

They told us then our flight had been cancelled we drove 2 hours to catch this flight then they told us along with 100 other people to go get in this other line to speak to an agent ( only 2 working) After 2 hours we finally were at the agent to be told the flight was cancelled due to no crew. Sad all the way around, if you have a reason to be somewhere at a certain time do not fly Spirit Airlines. I will never make this mistake again.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,they just didn’t care,True,"  After already having checked in for my 2:00 AM flight in Aguadilla, BQN, like I was at the airport and my flight was cancelled unexpectedly, due to a staffing issue (flight attendant missing). As I waited to be rerouted, I called the Spirit line they provided to be put on the soonest flight. They indicated there was nothing for over 24 hours and I have to work on Monday (it’s Sunday). I said no I wasn’t interested and see what they airport could do. Being among the first there, I find out that the rep went behind my back and booked me for that flight the following days anyways, making my rebooking a nightmare. The phone rep was like “I can give you a refund “I’m like I don’t want a refund, I want to go home.” I was able to get rerouted home, but my flight would not be until 12 hours later, all the way in San Juan (about a 2 hour drive). For our inconvenience they sent us meal vouchers automatically and got a taxis for everyone to go to the other airport. We were sardines. No COVID protocols taken by Spirit other than masks, packing 11 people into a vehicle. We had no idea who this company was and absolutely no information. The gentleman got us to the airport, sleep deprived and all, around 3:30 am. We had 8 or so hours to wait. When I got out, I thought I grabbed everything and unfortunately did not notice I had not grabbed my purse, that had my medications, my identification, COVID vaccine card, as well as my air pods and a lot of money ; yes, shame on me. That is completely my fault. What is unforgivable is that every rep in the airport but Spirit was able to assist me in one form or another. We had no way to contact the taxi service they sent us on and they apparently had no way to contact their Aguadilla location to find out who THEY used! Desperate and in a panic as I was calling the Aguadilla office and receiving no acknowledgment, I went to the Jet Blue rep and she directed me to the Spirit line to see if they could dig up the number. The employee who assisted me was lifeless and really knew no information despite the number of times she seemed to be pretending to help. I went back to the Jet Blue line to see how they recommended to proceed, I had copies of my DL on my phone. They said I should be able to pass with it but to go to an officer and file a report so I can use as proof to board. I wasn’t giving up but I also needed to get my ducks in a row. The Jet Blue reps were very friendly and TSA even called in an officer to help assist. My mom kept look out for the van that brought us and by some miracle we were able to get in contact with the taxi driver, an hour or so later, and he came back With everything. Nothing had been moved. Spirit caused all of my issues. I would never have lost my purse if I was on the original flight instead of running around like a crazy person. I was a nervous wreck unnecessarily due to their failure to effectively communicate with their comrades and almost had a panic attack. I understand losing my bag was my fault, I’m disappointed in the fact that they all saw how frantic I was with tears rimming my eyes and they just didn’t care. Everyone, and I mean everyone, who I came in contact with other that Spirit, gave me new info on my quest to getting it back.

I never recieved conformation it was cancelled. it was a layover to get to our final arrival, and we never made it. Had to buy a whole separate airline ticket because Spirit didn’t have any flights from FLL to ATL until Monday. We were supposed to board at 6:30 on July 31. 12+ hours away from home, no where to go. Have tried to get through to a representative for the entire night via emails/chats. Can’t get a response from anyone. On top of that, we had to rent and rental car which was over $200 since we had to drive 3 hours to another airport. We then had to book a separate flight with another airline.  However, that was another $200. So in a total, I lost out on a flight, $130 from bags (they weren’t even checked in), $200 rental, and a $200 new flight ticket. Never fly Spirit. Save yourself your time and money. We are lucky we had a contact as close as we did. Delta, you have my heart! If it would let me give 0/10, I would.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Do not fly on Spirit if you want a reliable airline,False,"  Spirit is at it again. They canceled my flight home to Denver last minute (45 minutes until boarding) due to a ""crew shortage"" which I highly doubt since they have plenty of other flights headed out after mine was supposed to depart. I guarantee the real reason they canceled is because the flight wasn't as full as they wanted it to be. Do not fly on Spirit if you want a reliable airline. This is a company that does not care about its customers in the slightest.",-1

I have paid for hotels and rental car. Very disappointed, lost work time kids disappointed. Don’t recommend this airline at all. Even Customer service hang up on me.",-1
2021-07-31,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Kingston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,I hate Spirit pure robbery,True,"  Traveling to meet our wedding party June 8th 2021 and we arrived at the airport to be told that our flight departed June 7th 2021 With proof of itinerary for June 8th - 15th 2021 . Spoke with everyone and anyone at the ticket counter they were shocked. They scrambled to help us and the sad part is I received no accommodation or anything. I booked through Expedia called Expedia, they said no call spirit they change the date. I got no email notification or anything luckily American airlines was next to Spirit and they accommodated us. I lost $577.10 for a trip on an airline I never boarded. Had to buy a brand new ticket $800 per person and drive to a different airport and they gave us a free trip for our anniversary .

In other words, I did Spirit Airline’s job. All I had to do was drop off bag. Well, the bag drop off is closed so we had to stand in a line out of this world.

I went to MCO airport today in Orlando Florida for my 6 am flight to Dallas. First there was a line around the corner and one person working. When I finally made it to the front of the line at approximately 5.30 after waiting in line for almost an hour, I was told to get out of line and stand by to be assisted. Needless to say I missed my flight. I then went back to the desk to speak with someone in regards to this. I was met with attitude and a barrage of words basically saying this was my fault. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the supervisor just told me there was nothing she could do and turned and walked away without trying to help me or come up with a solution. I called the 800 number trying to see if I could get some help. They left me on hold for over an hour. I just ended up buying another ticket for 100 dollars along with baggage. Then I looked online, the ticket itself was 49 dollars and they would not at least credit me the 51 dollars due to the inconvenience.",-1

2021-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,it was very stressful and traumatic for my wife,True," Boarding with Spirit Airlines has been the most negative experience my wife and I have ever had. A full 24 hours before the flight, I went online to check in. At this time also realizing they never sent me an email for my flight check in, so I had to call. Upon my call, the staff member gave me information about my reservation. At this time I informed him it wouldn’t let me check in, and asked if it looked good on his end. It did, he informed me. I then double checked, logged out and showed up the next day ready to go, 40 minutes early to go through security, which is short at KCI airport. We were then informed, after asking for our tickets (Spirit does not provide a boarding pass online that I would find) that we were not checked in, and because we missed the cut-off we could not get our tickets or board our flight. Neither could we get a refund, neither were they willing to help in any way, even with my wife being along in her pregnancy and having a panic attack due to the poor ness of the interaction and complete lack of customer service and ownership. Essentially, they stole from us, our time, energy, money, and it was very stressful and traumatic for my wife. We will not being flying Spirit out of KC any time soon, and hope that this review causes leadership to act and not take advantage of families. We were set up to fail. and that was very clear from the lack of appropriate systems and customer service in place.",-1

2021-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Latrobe to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit had automatically rebooked,True," A year ago I booked a flight with Spirit from Arnold Palmer Airport LBE to Myrtle Beach to catch up with my family on vacation for the last two full days of their vacation and planned to drive back with them after Labor Day Weekend. I got delayed due to some problem on the plane and we got no snacks, water or anything being held in the plane for over an hour. Today Tuesday July 27, 2021 I was booked again on Flight NK3006 from LBE to MYR for 8.23pm flight. At 4.32 my employee whom booked this flight got a text informing me my flight was cancelled. My employee was off duty and planning to pick me up at 5.15 to get to the airport by 6.40 when he got this text, and he was at DMV getting his license renewed, for over an hour. He text my son whom contacted Spirit Via Text Chat and Spirit offered to cancel their rebooking for the following day and re-book out of Pitt for same day at 6.51, at 4.51pm, where I had less than 2 hours to be driven 93 miles to Pitt. I made it the 93 miles hoping as my employee said, hey the airlines are understaffed and the pilot may have been forced to stop flying which is why they canceled the flight, and hopefully the pit flight had an inbound delay so you still make the flight by arriving at 6.31pm for a 6m51p flight. Finding all of the story was the son had called for attempt to reschedule and he found Spirit had automatically rebooked for 7/28/21 out of LBE at 3pm. But when Spirit at Pit found I couldn’t check in on time they started demanding re-schedule fee of $99, after the automated offer of a $50 voucher for their cancellation. We did not want to allow emotions to escalate with a female airline employee and chose to go back to text chat resolution! Again they demanded $99 rebooking fee (BTW I upgraded to First Row Seat $55). All I was asking was a credit on file for next year and they said no! I rebooked out of CKB on Allegiant Air for $70 plus upgraded seat for $21, all totaled $91. I will say this new Allegiant Air which I took about six weeks ago, CKB to MYR, a very easy flight and less hassle!",-1

If I could, I would rate them -100 for their customer service. I had my connecting flight from O'Hare to San Francisco through LAX. First segment of my flight got delayed by 3hrs and they wouldn’t assure me about catching the second segment. They asked me to stay in the airport overnight without any compensation.

Ticket prices are rising and customer service is deteriorating. Coupons are also getting worse every month. This time I got a coupon for 50% off however when trying to use it on their website it keeps saying coupon does not exist and to call customer service. After trying all day to reach customer service I finally reach someone who tells me “we cannot fix the website, that is up to the guest” How am I supposed to fix your website! Then she tells me I just have to wait and it will fix itself. Yeah ok, because it can just magically fix itself, and how long will this take? The coupon is only good for 4 days and 1 of them it hasn’t been working, hopefully tomorrow it will magically “fix itself”.",-1

My flight into Fort Lauderdale was horrible. First the plane could not take off because all the signals on the dash was lit up and pilots didn’t know what was wrong. Second the air conditioning did not work. We had to depart the plane and wait for 3+ hours for them to fix air. Then it didn’t work fully because they only had half an air conditioner unit available. On my way back home (arrived 2 hours ahead of flight) did not make flight. Then they said we can rebook within the next two days!! I just booked with Southwest instead and will be going home today.,-1

Two days in Costa Rica without anything and customer service couldn’t tell us anything. Their solution was check the internet to see where it was. Until this day it still shows “unavailable” as status! Then to top it off, on the flight back they delayed it twice causing us to arrive too close to connecting flight and changed our next flight to the next day at 6:30am. Didn’t ask us just did it! Had to stay the night in Orlando and wouldn’t provide us lodging for the night! Flight attendants are very rude as well as customer service at airports!

They cancel and delay your flight in the middle of the night with no accommodations, mess up all your plans you have for your vacation because you’re arriving late and then they turn around and delete your flight to return home for over four hours. Please do not pick this airline, you will be very sorry especially if you have plans that’s paid for.

Shockingly People from Spirit team told us it's too late, as we reached late. This is ridiculous for my family stay all over night in the airport as the next flight to Tampa after 24 hours. Then after many trials we found flight to Miami then to Tampa, however the time between them 15min. After we reached the Gate we found a delay 90min. I cannot believe that a flight that would take 6 hours ended up with 20 hours. Spirit is the worst airline I flew with.",-1

If it's not delayed to your destination it's delayed on the way back. Seats are incredibly uncomfortable. I've flown with spirit a bunch of times and my past flight gave me a scare. I had anxiety the whole way.  At take off the plane felt like it dropped and lifted again. At some point in the air the plane was shaking going through a cloud. I get this happens but this one was pretty bad people were near falling out the seats. The pilot or attendants weren't communicative about what may have been happening to keep us calm.,-1

Can you imagine sitting down and looking at this thing which could possibly have to save my life in the event of an emergency? Only 1 bathroom working for 228 people, you do the math. When I contacted Spirit, they said they verified my story, which consisted of lies told by the crew! Always take pictures folks. If you value your life, don’t fly Spirit.",-1
2021-07-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Saint Thomas to Orlando via Boston,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,I should have known better,True,"  Truly terrible. Like many other reviewers for Spirit Airlines, I should have known better. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $50 on a ticket for Jet Blue. I was flying to Orlando from Saint Thomas, and was supposed to transfer to Boston. The plane from Saint Thomas was ""diverted"" to San Juan, Puerto Rico, so they could refuel. Why they couldn't do that in Saint Thomas, I have no idea. We were joking on the plane that this is just like when you only put in a bit of fuel so you can make it to a cheaper gas station. So we were delayed in San Juan for one hour, which caused me to miss my flight to Boston. The stewardesses on the flight were reassuring me that the attendant at Orlando would be able to put me on the next available flight to Boston, even if it was with another airline. Barring that, they would at least be able to put me up in a hotel and give me dinner. Needless to say, in classic Spirit Airlines style, that did not happen. When I got to Orlando, I was told by the Spirit attendant that the refueling was due to ""weather conditions"", and so they would not only have to put me on the next Spirit airlines flight, which is 24 hours later, they would not put me in a hotel for the night. I spent an hour standing in the airport trying to not to lose it, and eventually came to the conclusion that I only had myself to blame for being out of my mind to ever even consider booking Spirit Airlines. I ended up paying out of my own pocket to get a hotel room and getting on the flight 24 hours the next day. I cannot recommend against flying Spirit airlines more. Every single flight I've ever had with Spirit has had some problem associated with it (cancelled flights, missing layovers, etc.). Truly the worst airline in America. Trust me, the $30 you save instead of booking United or America is NOT worth it. You will most likely spend more trying to compensate for Spirit Airline's terrible policies and general inadequacies. I would give this airline negative stars if possible. I am giving the flight attendants 3 stars because even though they were misinformed about their own airline's policies, I would be surprised if the company was at fault for not communicating to them correctly.",-1

2021-07-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit has taken no responsibility,True," Horrible experience. I was part of flight 760 from Las Vegas to Newark on Friday, July 16. It was supposed to leave at 10.30pm but because of lack of personnel, we were pushed to 1.30am, 7/17/21, then it was changed to 6.00 am on 7/17/21 and then 7am and then 7.30am. Half an hour before arriving to Newark, we had to land in another airport because of lack of fuel since there was a weather problem. We landed in Philadelphia, PA at almost 4pm. They made us get our baggage in baggage 4. Then, nothing was told to us and the police was involved. I understand that your company cannot foresee the weather but if you have had personnel, then we would have gotten there at 6am, as planned, and the weather wouldn’t have been bad in the morning. Spirit has taken no responsibility. I want a full refund, including taxes and my baggage fee. This is the minimum you all can do. I could ask for more, and I should but at this point I’m over it. I want my money back, I should change you for the time your company has made me lose.",-1

We are stuck in Fajardo (nothing available close to the airport) in a cheap hotel with no rental car. We had to extend airport parking and call out of work until we can make it back to the mainland.

My Flight got Delayed and because of it I ended up missing a connecting flight. I did not receive an automatic update and had to walk around from gate to gate like an idiot because no one knew what to do. I tried calling customer service several times and had to wait for half an hour each time before the call automatically ended. I finally stumbled on someone who told me to go to customer service. Waiting in the line took hours. Mind you my Flight landed at 9pm. I didn’t receive help until 12. I was told I could be accommodated with a place to stay but that was also a joke being that the book the next flight for 6am and all the hotel was over 30mins away. I ended up sleeping in the airport without any blankets, shivering the whole night. Will definitely not be using this airline again and you shouldn’t either. So not worth it.",-1

After discussing the disappointment with several people, I was able to rebook for 7:35. However, there 3:03 flight from BWI to Myrtle Beach was still sitting on the Tarmac at 7:35. Several passengers came of the flight cursing and fussing and demanding their money back. Then it turned into an all out verbal war between current passengers, future passengers and the airline when they stated that the flight to San Juan would be delayed another 5 hours until 12:30am in the morning. This would make almost 24 hours my family would’ve been waiting in the airport. On top of this they didn’t have any wheelchair assistants available and the refused to honor our military status to check luggage for free. This airline is not worth it. This is not at all worth the small amount of money you save. They are cheap for a reason.",-1

That was a sign! We decided not too, so while waiting at the airport, Spirit changed/delayed our flight time 3 times! After checking one last time it said that our flight time was changed back to the normal time. When walking to the new gate, our flight was completely gone from the list of flights on the board and when we checked our emails, we got an email saying that our flight had been canceled. Trying to get help and service from them was a disaster! They did not want too give vouchers for food or for a hotel and they tried to book us a new flight, but not for another 5 days without even asking us! Thankfully, they issued our refund but we had to pay for our own hotel! While talking to other people in the line for our refund, they told us that Spirit did this to them days prior and then tried to blame it on the weather.",-1
2021-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Cancun via Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,"rude, condescending and discriminatory",True,"  On Monday July 12th, 2021, my mother and I set off to embark on our 5 day 4 night Vacation in Mexico 🇲🇽.  We went to BWI 3 hours early to catch out flight at 9:37. We had a connecting flight in Orlando that would take us to our destination. We left Baltimore on time landed in Orlando with time to spare. We ate and waited. Our 1 pm flight was delayed until 2. Then our 2 flight was delayed until 4. Our 4 flight was delayed until 6. At around 5:45, our 6 flight was canceled. Now we are stuck in Orlando and the earliest flight Spirit Airlines  can put us on is for 1:00pm on Tuesday July 13th, 2021. Spirit Airlines did nothing to accommodate us in Orlando, so my mother and I had to pay for a hotel in Orlando to keep from spending the night in the airport. We return to the airport on Tuesday, July 17th, 2021, 3 hours early for our flight again. We sit at the gate and our flight is delayed again. We finally make it to Mexico around 4 pm Central. That makes 2 days I was supposed to be on my vacation wasted by traveling. On Friday, July 16th, 2021 we returned to the airport around 10am Central. Our flight was to leave at 12:37 pm Central to Fort Lauderdale. It was delayed again. This time the delay kept changing from 1 to 2 to 2:30 to 2:15 to 2:25. We did not take off until 3:35pm Central. This made us late for our 5:55 pm Eastern Time connecting flight to BWI. When we arrived at FLL Spirit had booked us for their next available flight to South Carolina with a connecting flight to Baltimore. When I approached the Spirit counter in Terminal 4 Baggage Claim area, the male representative there was very rude, condescending and discriminatory towards those with disabilities. He told one older woman in a wheelchair that her missing her flight due to no one coming in time to assist her to the gate that it was ""her fault"" and that she needed to pay a $99 rebooking fee. He interrupted my mother in conversation several times and instructed her to ""calm down"" in a condescending way. We eventually just booked another flight with a different airline and asked for our money back. It was then that we were told we would only get about $80 from a $200 flight because the rest of the money paid was due to government fees and taxes which Spirit has no authority over. At the end of this experience I was out of 2 days of vacation that I paid for and an extra $200 for a flight back home that I should have been on with Spirit. The moral of the story is Spirit owes me an apology and a vacation.",-1
2021-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Mexico,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Such a bad experience,False,"  Absolutely bad, flight cost is cheap and they get that out from bags, snacks and drinks. The seat is so hard that your butt starts to hurt in 30mins. The leg room is so so small that won’t fit above 6FT. To check the bags in we waited 3 hours and almost missed our flight. The flight was delayed for 2 times for no reason and they finally boarded us but we waited another hour inside the flight to actually get the engine going. Such a bad experience, we said never Spirit again and I would give minus rating if there was a number available.",-1

I had to pay an additional 184$ for 2 carryons that weigh 8 pound and 13 pound. The seat is like a hard plastic cheer feeling, Flight was delayed for 4 and half hours, the service was terrible,",-1
2021-07-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Lisbon via Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I am very disappointed by the poor service,True," On July 2nd of this year my wife and I were scheduled to travel to Portugal from Myrtle Beach, SC. My wife is from Portugal and we wanted to visit her family. Her father passed away last March – right at the height of the pandemic and we couldn’t attend the funeral because of the flight and travel restrictions to other countries. Her family planned a memorial service for Monday, July 5th to pay respects to her father. We were scheduled to depart the Myrtle Beach (MYR) airport to Boston (BOS) on the 2nd at 2.12pm, flight 3112 on Spirit Airlines. The connecting flight out of Boston to Lisbon was at 6.20 that evening, flight 218 on TAP Air Portugal. Unfortunately, the flight departing from MYR was delayed until 3.51pm (which can be verified via FAA flight records) putting us in Boston at 5.45pm (also verified in FAA records). Here’s where I hold Spirit Airlines accountable. The check in @ BOS for the flight to Lisbon closed at 5.20pm (1 hour before departing) and the flight to Boston hadn’t even landed when the Lisbon flight closed for check in. Because of the Spirit Airlines flight delay, we missed our flight to Lisbon. By the time we made it to the gate to speak with a TAP Air Portugal, they had gone for the day. We then went to speak with a Spirit Airlines customer service representative and were told that there’s nothing they could do to help us out and went on to tell us that they aren’t responsible for any missed flights. Ultimately, they simply said that we should have purchased flight insurance. We decided to spend the night in Boston hoping to speak with TAP Air Portugal the next day – only to find out that all flights were full for the next 3 days. In the end – we ended up flying back to Myrtle Beach on Saturday. No trip to Portugal, no vacation and missing the memorial service with her family to honor her father on Monday. Thanks to Spirit Airlines we are out $2000 for (2) round trip tickets + $200 for a night in Boston + $250 a rental car in Lisbon that we paid for and never got to use. I am very disappointed by the poor service provided by Spirit Airlines. They have left my wife and I very painful memory of a vacation that never happened.",-1
2021-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,absolute worst airline ever,False,"  This is the absolute worst airline ever. I was on a flight 784 on July 16,2021 service from Punta Cana to Fort Lauderdale. The flight attendant who refuses to give her name was extremely rude. There was a family who did not understand English. We were already in the air and they were trying to locate items from their carry on bag. They announced over the loud speaker only in English that we were required to sit down. There was a Spanish speaking flight attendant on this flight and not one time did he attempt to translate to accommodate the family who paid for their ticket and should be subject to the same thing as English speaking customers. She has the audacity to say “we are an American based company if they want to fly with us they need to understand English” I was extremely offended with what she said and in disbelief. I felt bad for the family. Flight attendants who have that attitude should not work for an airline who travels to destination out of the country. Then once I landed for my connecting flight I sat waiting for 4 hours to board my connecting flight to Baltimore Maryland NK2074. My flight was supposed to board at 8:11pm it is now 10:30pm as I’m writing this review sitting on a plane that just finished boarding to my destination. I did not receive any notification of the delay at all whether it had been via email or through their app, I’m not not going to get to my destination until the next day. Spirit has by far the worst customer service and flight attendants.",-1

2021-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Dallas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I had a terrible experience,False,"  I had a terrible experience with this airline. On our way to the airport, we received emails that our flight was delayed (twice within the space of 90 minutes). We arrived at the airport and learned that we would not be able to make our connecting flight as a result of the delay. The service reps told us they could not help us and referred us to Priceline (where we made our reservation). After getting through to a service rep at Priceline, the rep confirmed they could not assist since Priceline reps don't have access to flight status information. The long and short of this experience is that we spent an additional $1,000 booking a flight through American Airlines which, by the way, was a much better experience. When I asked a Spirit rep for reimbursement, they informed me we were a 'no show' and would not reimburse us. This, of course, is not true, I can prove with boarding passes and bag tags that we were checked in at the airport. I will NEVER fly Spirit again. The worse experience I've ever had with an airline.",-1

What could possibly be the reasoning for this? We have waited hours and as soon as we pushed back we are once again forced to have our flight delayed to pick up an employee passenger. I demand reimbursement for my time. You have ruined my vacation. All for not having the proper equipment, defibrillator, and now an employee passenger.

2021-07-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Richmond,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,It’s cheap for a reason!,True," First the customer service and the policy is ridiculous! I had to change a flight due to unforeseen circumstances only to be told that I couldn’t get a refund but a credit and it had to be used in a certain amount of time. I rebooked the flight to another location and they tried to charge me the full amount instead of the difference which was more than the actual price. I was on the phone with those people on and off from 9am until 1am the next day and I finally got someone that did what they were supposed to do. Well coming back from New Orleans where our ride was delayed and I got there an hr before I was supposed to go and was greeted by a rude young man who said you need to go to the counter you may have to catch another flight. So I go to the counter and the lady there was rude, she had me go thru all my emails way back from May looking for a code and I was standing there for another 30 minutes only for her to tell me to read the fine print and we can’t help if your Uber was delayed. We have a 2 hour time frame and only a 15 minute grace period to board so I’ll have to catch another flight tomorrow which an additional 600! I was livid, you held me up an additional 30 minutes looking for an email to tell me that and I can’t get home until tomorrow. They would not refund me at all! I had to take another airline to get home and they both left at the same time and they still allowed me to board with them and I cut down my 10 hour ride to 3! It’s cheap for a reason!",-1

Paid almost 509 dollars with the boost and chose the front seats. Flight times were delayed 4 times. Final time was around 1:45am. Initial time the 10:55pm. So with the last 1:50am delay arrived around midnight. Right when we approached the very non-customer service girl, she said “you can’t fly”, ”this is the same we told her” and there was another lady. Then a family with a mother and two children, then 2 men. There was no refund, only that the tsa closed at 8pm and that we should have come earlier. Called customer service. Nothing, the text option does not work. Flight to Florida to drop off my daughter almost 500! Flight back 219! This airline is a rip off with just as rude customer service. I purchased my flight by myself back to work at 7:15am something like that through spirit! They charged my card, yet no ticket confirmation to my email! Nothing! The screen went blank on my laptop!

They have the lowest bags allowed so you will have a bag charge and it will be an up charge from the up charge. They lied to us over and over trying to get home after Midnight.

2021-07-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I should have at least received some assistance,True," After waiting in a line of chaos at the New Orleans ticket counter for over 40 minutes to drop off my checked bag that I paid over $50 to check, I made it to the gate as the doors for my flight were closing. The supervisor at the gate, treated me as if I were accused of a horrific crime when I asked for assistance. She would not make eye contact with me, would not answer my questions and literally dismissed me to the ticket counter of chaos. Following this, I called customer support and after long waits got no assistance. Even if it were my fault that I missed my flight, I should have at least received some assistance. Shameka and the unhelpful customer support representatives have obviously forgotten that it is the patronage of customers like myself that keep their paychecks coming. Never again will I spend money to pay Shameka and the like to treat me like a dog.",-1

My family and I were trying to get back home to PA after our trip to Florida this past week. We arrived at the airport at 2 pm, went through bag check in, security, and waiting for the plane, which all added up to around 4.30pm-5.00pm ish. Around an hour later, our flight was delayed for an 1 hour and a half. Our plane lands, we boarded the plane, they made us buckle in and get us ready for our flight, only to tell us 2 hours later of sitting on the plane that our flight was canceled. The staff on the plane were rude and the directory inside the Spirit international check in was terrible. The day after (today July 12, 2021), we are taking another flight to a nearby city to where I live in PA. Again, only for them to tell us that our flight is delayed. Their excuse for the flight cancellation yesterday was because the pilot was too tired to fly the plane and today they’re short on flight attendants. I highly recommend anyone considering flying with Spirit take your time and money elsewhere. This is a terrible airline and my family and I will never be riding with Spirit Airlines ever again.",-1

The attendant at the front before checking into TSA was trained and only trained to make you as irate as possible. Besides from getting into the details which I’m sure you have all read on here already, they are made to take as much money from you as possible before you get in on that flight. “It’s policy to check in your small bag” is what they are trained to say. And don’t get mad, because they threatened to call Sheriffs Office on you if you get mad. This is by far the worst flight experience I’ve ever had with any airline.",-1

Here in Pensacola the counter service crew was bad, they seemed to hate their job and passengers, we told the only pleasant guy that was on the check-in machines that we had already checked in online so he asked us to go straight to the counter, well the lady sent us back to the machine to print our baggage ticket, when we got back to her she told us that she can’t receive our luggage 4 hours before our flight - when honestly I didn’t have that issue before with other airlines.

2021-07-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Atlanta,,,,,,,1.0,be taking my business elsewhere,False,"  Spirit claims to help people save money, BUT should you want to cancel a flight, if it is more than 24 hrs after booking, not only do you lose money in fees but the balance is given as a reservation credit that is only good for 2 months. Customer service is happy to waste your time asking you to “bear with me” while they research the matter only to turn around and give you a scripted reply advising that their hands are tied and all you can get is the reservation credit amounting to a fraction of the original cost of your tickets. Rest assured I will not look to Spirit for saving money at the detriment of a quality experience. In the future I will certainly be taking my business elsewhere.",-1

Lauderdale to Denver was in jeopardy. As time went on we talked to the agent in BWI about missing our connecting flight and was assured we were booked on a Southwest flight to Denver upon arrival to Ft Lauderdale. Upon arrival in Ft. Lauderdale there was no flight or booking with Southwest. Needless to say we were lied to just to keep us quiet. In talking the an agent in Ft. Lauderdale we were practically called liars in telling her what we had been told in BWI. Both agents were very rude and condescending. We were booked on flight for the next day. Because of health issues we felt it was imperative to get home to Denver as soon as we could. We therefore booked a flight on Southwest for early the next morning. This cost us an extra $1000. We understood the weather delays but we were lied to and called liars. No way to run an airline.",-1
2021-07-09,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Nashville via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,customer service was of no service,False,"  My wife and I had a 12:36 flight to Nashville with a two hour delay in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The flight out of Philly was a half hour late. It had been raining in Florida, however, we landed with no problem. While taxiing to the gate, a flight attendant announced we would be waiting on the tarmac for approximately twenty-five minutes due to a plane still loading at our respective gate. Forty-five minutes later we began moving. We were scheduled for Gate F 6, The Nashville flight would be departing F 8. Instead we wound up at Gate G 12. In Fort Lauderdale G to F is one end of the airport to the other. There were twelve passengers who had to make the connecting flight to Nashville. To the credit of the flight attendants, they requested that the passengers let the twelve Nashville people off first. The twelve became about thirty. Debarking we had approximately five minutes to run through the airport. Needless to say the Nashville plane already left. There was no one at the gate to give us some insight regarding what to do. Somehow we found the was a Spirit customer service desk back at Gate G 10 - another trek through the airport, The young lady behind the desk reacted like we were bothering her. Her response, ""We could take the next Spirit flight the next day at 4:30 pm. Have a nice day."" We had a hotel in Nashville booked plus a tour booked the next morning, She said it was not the airlines fault but our fault for being on a plane waiting over forty-five minutes to find a gate. Another young lady named Devin came. At least she was more empathetic to our situation. Finally some manager arrived. He stated Spirit was not responsible for us missing the Nashville flight blaming first the weather (we had no problem landing) then blamed the airport. Finally he offered a refund if we wanted. Where do we stay? What do we do? One of the twelve found a nine-thirty Jet-Blue Nashville flight which we booked. We left Philadelphia at 12:45 pm and arrived in Nashville at 12:30 am add another half hour by the time we got to our hotel. Delays happen but it was the lack of concern by the Spirit personnel with the exception of Devin and the flight attendants. They could have found us the Jet-Blue flight or, God forbid, put us up for the night. We were literally on our own. My wife and I are also ""Spirit Club"" members or whatever the call their group. I found a definite lack of good spirit with Spirit. Their customer service was of no service.",-1

Delayed from the check-in lines, having to move from one line to another because we are apparently standing in the wrong lines! Forcing us to pay extra $$ close to $400 and change a flight when we now only have 30mins remaining to go past TSA. Our 6.10am flight completely changed without our notice so we'd not have a direct flight. We accept and wait for a new 3pm flight. Guess what? The flight is delayed now, its not the agents delaying our flight and taking responsibility! Then they say our small bag is a check-in bag! Overall you pay an arm and a leg, super expensive when you fly Spirit! Over 40 customers all had to switch their flights because Spirit agents try to purposely make you late! Pay American Airlines or Delta and get to your destination happy and content.",-1

I booked a flight in March, which I later ended up having to cancel, but since I did not cancel within 48 hours, I had to receive a credit instead of being refunded on my card. That was fine with me! I just had to speak with a customer service representative to confirm and he said I would receive the credit information in an email. I was sure to repeat my email more than several times due to the representative lacking proper English and comprehension. I asked him if these calls were being recorded in case someone would have to go back due to a mistake on his part. Long story short, although I took the proper precautions, he still managed to send my credit to the wrong email. Someone who did have my last name ,but this person lived in Florida. A person I do not know. This person was able to book three flights under my credit. So when it came time to book my flight, I was told I have three dollars. I have called over and over and have waited on hold for hours, I have left a complaint and still have yet to hear back from anyone at Spirit Airlines. This makes me never want to book a flight again. They are very messy and unprofessional.",-1
2021-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,by far the worst airline,True,"  This airline is by far the worst airline I have ever run across in my life. I do not even know how they can be still be in business with their policies and cutting corners. I think they intentionally make it impossible to cancel or change any flight. My first experience with them started during covid, it had just started, and all flights were canceled. I canceled the flight online, but their website doesn’t work except to book flights but never to cancel them. I was told that I never canceled my flight, but I did multiple times and even sent them proof but catch this, they didn’t even fly on that day due to the shutdown policy, but they were still penalizing me for it, unbelievable. After contacting them numerous amounts of time they begrudgingly gave me credit when other airlines issued full refunds. I decided it was time to use my credit, so I bought a ticket yesterday around noon then decided two hours later to cancel the flight. Under the customer service standard set by the Department of Transportation that says airlines must let travelers hold a reservation at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment, or allow a purchased reservation to be canceled within 24 hours without penalty and with a full refund to the original form of payment. All airlines operating to, from, and within the U.S. must comply with the 24-hour rule. The clock starts ticking on the 24 hours once the ticket purchase has been made. The only exception to note that the DOT rule does not apply in a handful of cases. The refund policy only applies to bookings made at least seven days or more before departure. But if you make a reservation less than seven days before the flight’s departure date, the 24-hour rule does not cover your booking—meaning you have no grace period to cancel and receive a full refund. My flight was ten within days to my trip, therefore I do not fall under the exception. I have been trying to contact someone for almost 24 hours now. Either I am on hold for hours or when someone picks up the connection is terrible because their customer service is another county. The specialists on WhatsApp were wonky, slow and terrible. The lady I finally spoke to said I would be charged $104 but for what? I am well within my right to cancel without penalty. She said that I needed to have booked the flight 7 days before departure which is the exact opposite of what the law states, I do not understand the level of intelligence. I do not know if she was confused or that is how they were trained to lie to customers and frustrate them while charging them illegal fees. I finally got transferred to a supervisor or manager that gave me my full refund. I should have never had to go through hell and high water to cancel my flight, I spent most of my day today and yesterday trying to resolve a situation that would have taken most airline 2 minutes or less with other major airlines. I am still stuck with them because I have to use my credit, but I can assure you of one thing and one thing only, I will never travel with Spirit Airlines again.",-1
2021-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spend your money somewhere else!,True,"  Purchased the ticket in March, a week later got a whole new itinerary. Really didn’t like the new one but we still took the new itinerary. When we arrived at the ticket counter, the line was in disarray. We arrived 2 hours early like the ticket said. There was over 150 in line for 2 flights. After being in line for 1:20 mins I asked the attendant how were we going to make the flight with over 150 people stretched out past all the other airlines check in counters. THEN she proceeded to separate the line into 2 lines depending on where u were flying. 4 people held the line up for 45 mins with issues bout their flight. Mind u there was only one attendant for each line. So the line we were in got held up by the SAME 4 people. By the time their issue was resolved there was still over 50-60 people in the line needing to drop bags or check in. When we finally got our bags dropped we had 9 mins to make it through security and get to our gate!!! Everyone else behind us missed the flight due to no fault of their own. How do spirit expect to check in 275 passengers for a flight with one damn counter open? The weigh scales were all inaccurate. So most people in line thought they were good to only find out at the counter the bag was over and they need to pay more money! Nothing is free with Spirit! Bags are $46 most airlines charge $30 to $35. U don’t even get complimentary water or anything! On the way back we had delay and had a nearly 5 hour layover! I will never fly spirit again EVEN IF ITS FREE! This airline needs to be shut down. Don’t be fooled by the cheaper tickets because they are going to get it through other ways like Baggage, snacks and other tactics. They intentional made those people miss their flights and didn’t have a care in the world about it. The right thing to do was to open all those counters and try ur best to get those people on the flights they’ve paid for. They didn’t care because they made some money and realized they could make more. They didn’t even try to delay the plane!! All those people missed the flight and had to do something because some had dropped their bags (so now they pretty much gotta buy another ticket) because they bags are headed to their destination. but they didn’t have enough time to get through security and to the departure gate. Luckily my husband and I barely made it. They literally shut the plane door behind him. There were over 40 empty seats on that plane, from people who missed their flight because they sold 275 tickets and tried to use one lady to check in all Those people and bags in 2 hours. We were so sore The following morning from running like we were in a marathon. Just to make it to the gate since our bags were already gone. Spend your money somewhere else! Spirit will have you book a flight, then change that flight then turn around and change that flight too! They are not worth the few bucks you think your gonna save.",-1

2021-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,has the worst service ever,True,  My family missed our flight because of horrible service from spirit. The online check was not working and when i call the phone rep told me i have talk to clerk at airport. Get airport clerk say i have to pay her per person for her to check us in so she make me download app and check in for free. Get to TSA and our boarding passes are not working and TSA make us go back to the spirit ticket service. I go back spirit ticket service and have wait back in line to get service for the 2nd time. We now get to TSA and they have closed lanes. We finally get to gate and its closed. If i would not have had the boarding passed issue we would have made our flight because everyone else we was with made it to the flight. If the clerk at airport would not have been so lazy and actually assist me and paid attention she could have caught the error so i would not have to experience having to be turned around at TSA and having to go back to ticket station and wait all over again. The clerk at airport charges me 35 dollars for my bag was only 39.5 pounds and Spirit website say 40 pounds. I feel the airport clerk purposely messed up my boarding passes and charge me because i told her spirit phone rep said she could check me in for free since the online services kept giving error message. This was the worst experience of my life and to make it even worst they couldn't give us another flight until Wednesday and my original flight was for Monday. Spirit has the worst service ever.,-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Colorado Springs via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,"  Worst airline ever. Even with the “lower” cost I have never had such long delays with any airline. Not only was my departing flight from Las Vegas to Colorado Springs delayed by 5 hours, but my return flight is now delayed by 2 hours (which could change, just like my flight here). I contacted Spirit Airlines to see if there is anything they can do, as I have now been inconvenienced twice with them. Their answer was I could take a carryon for free.  If I already checked in with no carryon or luggage, why would I suddenly want this? I have flown other discount airlines and have never had the delay problems like this. I will never fly this airline again. And if your time is valuable, I recommend you do not use them either.",-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,used the same bag the other 4 times,False,  This is my 5th time this year flying with Spirit and have never had an issue with my bag until today .. they charged me $65. I’ve used the same bag the other 4 times. If you make rules they should be followed each flight. Was told at the gate anything going in the overhead compartment is considering a carry on and should be charged. Upon boarding the flight numerous ‘personal items’ in the overhead bins but none of those are being charged if you do one better do all not pick and choose.,-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Houston,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,disappointed with Spirit Airlines,True,"  We flew from Chicago O'Hare to IAH(Houston) on Jun 27th, 2021 to visit our friends + travel. Our Stroller/car seat/car seat base for my Daughter(9 months old) was received at the ""Gate claim"". We asked them to keep them because those are mandatory for us to travel with our baby. We landed at IAH around 2 pm. Then, we had to wait for more than 1hour to have our baggage but could not see the stroller/car seat/car seat base. We had to go to the Lost and Found office but no one was there. Then, we tried to find the Spirit counter to ask for help. A guy said they could not help us and gave us a number to call. We tried to call many times but no one picks up the phone. Then I tried to come back to the Lost and Found office to search the help again. Then, one lady tried to open the office for someone also. She looked for our stroller but could not see it. She took me back to the counter and ask the manager to help me. The manager looked at me and said they could not help. Then they gave me a number to call again. We tried to call many times but no one picks up the phone. That was around 4.30 pm. (More than 2 hours back and forth, our baby was exhausted and started to cry. My wife tried to feed her but she did not drink or eat). Then, we could contact someone at the number 678 973 2402. She tried to track the gate claim number and told me that the Stroller/car seat/car seat base are still in Chicago O'Hare. I was shock. I could not go anywhere without the Car seat/Car seat base. We tried to ask Spirit to borrow something because our daughter was really tired. That was around 6pm. But no one helped us. Finally, we gave up. We had to call around and ask our friends to come back another friend to borrow a car seat. We arrived our friend's house at 7.30pm. That means from 2 pm to 7.30pm, we had to stay at the IAH airport with our 9 months old baby. Really disappointed with Spirit Airlines and also the way they support us. Until now, we could not have our stroller/car seat/car seat base back.",-1

I’m absolutely repulsed and completely disappointed in myself for yet again taking a chance on Spirit Airlines. The lack of care Spirit Airlines has for their customers is highly concerning and frankly, quality and importance of care is non-existent. It’s time to make some changes, starting with the atrocities that are your planes. There is no appeal there and even less appeal when it comes to everything aforementioned. This is the absolute last time I go with Spirit airlines.",-1
2021-07-03,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Hartford,2.0,,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,an airline who will find any way to take your money,False,  Spirit is officially an airline who will find any way to take your money. I had a flight that was not scheduled to departure for another hour and a half. I arrived there early enough (I’ve always been super punctual with my time) to go through security and get my one single purse checked out to then catch the flight but unfortunately the flight attendants have told me that the doors from security closed three minutes ago. Again I was there early enough to go through security and I was ready to catch my flight but in this case they told me that in order for me to catch the next flight I would have to pay $100 out of pocket. It was clearly vulnerable due to the fact that the date was close to Mother’s Day and I wanted to visit my mom and family for the holiday so I ended up paying the $100 fee. Once I purchased the ticket I start heading towards security and I still see people going through and catching the fight that I was supposed to be in. Now I’m extremely disappointed and sad because I was provided with inaccurate information and robbed of my money. Long story short if you know you’ve done everything responsibly on your end make sure you also stand your ground and get serviced the correct way.,-1
2021-07-02,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,I will never buy cheap flights again,False,"  I will never buy cheap flights again. Ended up paying $1500 for the flight and to carry in 3 carry on. Paid for short cut security but the staff told us we didn't. Call them for a refund of just the $18 I paid to the short cut. But they telling me to go online to speak with a agent when I'm on the line with one now. You get what you pay for, next flights will be booked with a better airline.",-1
2021-07-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,agent and supervisor were just absolutely rude and inconsiderate,False,"  From BWI the plane was delayed to go to FLL for a connection to DEN. We completely understand the safety of the travelers and staff but the agents knew that we would not make our connection and lied to us they bought tickets for another airline for us to continue our destinations. When we got to FLL we were told by an agent who took 30 minutes to stand in line for her to help one person, was told we were liars by her and the supervisor. The next flight out was the next day so she eventually rebooked us. The issue was there was nowhere to go for the night and we were forced to stay in the airport in baggage claim area as FLL doesn’t allow to be by the gates. Mind you this is happening around 10pm at night. Bottom line Spirit didn’t address the bad behavior of their employees when complained to and they didn’t have a plan when asked. This cannot be the first time they were delayed on first plane and folks didn’t make second. The agent and supervisor were just absolutely rude and inconsiderate as well as no plan for the 20 plus travelers who now had no connection. This situation has caused severe emotional distress on me and my family so be forewarned about bad behavior. Will not be traveling on this airline again very unprofessional agents and extremely unorganized which makes me feel very unsafe flying with them.",-1
2021-07-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,miss our connecting flight,False,"  I knew this airline was bad but I didnt know it was this bad.  I left LAX airport and I had a connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale to Boston. Not only did they board us late from LAX but they left me on the Fort Lauderdale airport. They want us to be nice to them when they made us miss our connecting flight and made us wait 15 hours inside the airport. The customer service gave us incorrect boarding passes so when I went outside to check where my luggage is and tried to come back in, I was stuck outside for more than an hour because they couldn't figure out what this boarding pass is. My plane landed at 7am and I spent 6 hours trying to figure out everything and spirit did absolutely nothing for us. Every single counter we went to, we were given attitude and no questions were answered for us causing us to walk around trying to figure out what was going on. The first counter we went to after we arrived at the gate for our connecting flight and found that out flight left without us, they had the ability to answer every question for us and all 50+ people they left behind but they didnt do anything. The worst part is that they made us wait 15 hours for a standby flight same day at 9pm and they made 20 of us who were on standby for an hour and made sure everyone who had a confirmed ticket to be boarded.",-1

Immigration was supposed to be filled out from the internet, no one wanted to help! Security took too long and by the time I got to the door to get into the plane (I got their a few minutes early, I still had the chance to get into my flight) they cancelled my flight. I had to pay for my luggage. Even though I didn’t get on the plane, my luggage left without me. I’ve been trying to claim my luggage back but no one wants to help.

There is zero leg room, or arm room. The table you are supposed to eat on is the size of a tablet, and the money you save in your boarding pass, they get you with baggage.

We got the Car seat, car seat base and Stroller for my daughter checked in at the Gate Claim. Then, we could not have them at Houston. We tried to ask for help from Spirit employee, baggage claim office but no one helped. We had to stay at the air IAH from 2pm to 7pm to search for those. No one supported us. My daughter was very tired but we could not go to my friend’s house due to the car seat issue. Then, someone have us the baggage claim number to call. We called many times until someone picked up the phone. Then they said, the stroller is still in O’Hare airport. I don’t understand why?! Until now, we have not received any feedbacks about our strollers, car seat, car seat base. Really disappointed about Spirit airlines.",-1

2021-06-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,highly unsatisfied with this flight,True,"  I am highly unsatisfied with this flight. I had a flight scheduled for today just to get to the airport and be told that the flight was overbooked and I didn’t have a seat. I bought the ticket weeks ago and because I didn’t buy assigned seating I didn’t have a seat. I didn’t care to have assigned seating as long as I had seat on the plane. So people that bought the tickets after me who purchased assigned seating came before. How is it possible to overbook a flight as if you don’t know how many seats you have. Assigned seating is optional. I was also having technical issues with the website and I had been on the phone with them all morning to try to resolve it. I couldn’t check in due to this issue. I was hung up multiple times by the automated system, the second rep claimed he couldn’t hear me anymore after not knowing what to tell me and the third rep was the one who got the issue fixed for me. I was finally able to check in after 4 hours of calling back and forth and that is when they show you the board time. Not helpful for people having technical issues and they don’t have tech support. Wait times was almost an hour every time I called. I was trying to fly out for work and taking my family with me. Flights are important to people and it should not be okay for you to boot people off of the plane because you overbooked it and force them to buy assigned seating. We should just be able to sit in any available seat because we bought a ticket. So I am here not hoping that my refund is approved. The lady at the airport was very very nice which is why I didn’t take my frustrations out on her. She was about the best thing about the whole experience.",-1

When we asked them to book our flight and they gave flight after 2 days and they didn’t provide hotel. Their customer service entertained us at night 12 after 2 hours standing on line with kids.

You can take a “personal item” for free, like a backpack. I can usually fit all my trip items in the book bag. I did have to check a suitcase with my past trip. It’s 50 dollars for a bag under 40 pounds. I know you can bring a bigger carry on the plane as well, not sure of the price. I’ve had no issues with customer service or boarding. The tickets are dirt cheap, there’s no WiFi or power and with a little planning it’s not an issue. Super affordable and snacks are offered by the always friendly flight attendants.

2021-06-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle beach to Lancaster,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline I have ever used,False,"  Spirit Airlines is the absolute worst airline I have ever used. Period. The initial ticket prices are used as a 'bait and switch' to drag you in - then you get pounded with their baggage fees. Once they get you with the baggage fees - they have the audacity to make you pay for a standard economy seat - $30 - $40 - $50. Then once you are on the flight - they price gouge you again asking money for a Coke or Pepsi (didn't they used to give those for free?). I was on a flight from Lancaster that was late arriving for a connection with Spirit in DC. While going thru the gate late - they decided that they were going to screw me out of another $65 dollars for a carry on bag (keep in mind that the flight wasn't full and there was plenty of carry on luggage room above the seats). I went to print out my boarding pass the morning of the flight. Guess what - they're trying to get more $$$ for a 'preferred loading zone' pass - $4.99 if I remember correctly. I will be using their airlines again in 2 weeks as a connection flight to & from Portugal. I will post here the entire itemized cost for their baggage fee 'add on's', water & soft drink fees, pretzel & peanut fees and whatever else they decide that they want to try and squeeze from me.",-1
2021-06-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Detroit,,,,,,,1.0,Spirit Airlines is the worst airline,True,  This airline has the worst customer service in history. I have never been treated so poorly in my entire life! I called within 24 hours to cancel a ticket that I could not use due to a covid relate issue and the agent on the phone was carrying on a conversation with someone else in the background. He proceeded to laugh and carry on as I spoke to him. I had to repeat myself several times for a request to cancel the ticket. He ended up cancelling a duplicate ticket instead of the entire thing so I only received a partial refund from a ticket I was charged for but didn't even approve purchasing. The additional ticket was only issued as a partial credit of $18.40 for an $80 ticket?! This is absolutely outrageous and I believe people need to stop flying with this airline. It's best they be put out of business by better functioning airlines. Delta and American Airlines have always been accommodating and more than willing to help their customers. The true meaning of customer service. Spirit or should I say Lacking Spirit Airlines is the worst airline in the history of this country. Fly at your own risk because they take your money and give you the crappiest service known to human-kind.,-1

It seems to you they have cheap air fare but not at all when you have to pay 51 dollars on the carry on bag and 36 dollars on choosing seat - that’s only one way if round trip then double.

I arrived to airport around 1pm to only receive another email that said the flight was delayed a third time to 11.20pm and not arrive to Fort Meyers until 7.23pm. I paid for a nice hotel to spend the evening at that I wont even get to enjoy. I paid extra for the rental car to pick it up earlier. I made reservation for activities and I was not able to get refunded. I have lost well over $500 dollars because of Spirit Airlines.

Flight home was scheduled for 10am and was cancelled at 6am the morning of and we were out on a 10pm flight (12 hours later) and compensation $42 for meal vouchers for two of us (equates to $1.75 per hour for the inconvenience). Tried to talk to a person at the counter and she was dismissive and told us there was nothing they could do. Called spirit up and was put on hold for 2 hours waiting to talk to a supervisor.

So my leave came to an end, and I find out because I did not make my first flight Spirit Airlines canceled my $85 round trip. Without even so much as notifying me I tried to get it resolved but their customer service people who would not answer, and then kept putting me on hold till the call would drop. At the airport I was basically notified it was my fault. So I had to pay an additional $160 to the airline or a flight I already paid for. Customer service is the worst I’ve seen and I fly often. Overall terrible airline, people, service, aircraft, and just lack common cursory. I encourage people to stay away from Spirit Airlines.",-1

Do not fly with this airline even if the price looks good. There is always some kind of hidden agenda and you will find yourself paying more for a cheap flight. They find a way to make you miss your flight by switching the airline waiting station and overcharge you for carrying on or any luggage you fly with. I would not fly with them even if they offer me a free flight! Why? Because this company lacks integrity and customer service. Even if they claim that they will refund you, they are lying! You are just a number to them and they only want your money.",-1

We were not notified that our flight had been changed and would have never known that there were changes to our flight if I would not have checked the itinerary. We now are scheduled to leave at 11.30am and will not arrive in PR until 8pm. We basically lost a whole day of our trip. Completely disappointed with this unprofessional airline.

Customer service took 3 hours to reach back in between texts when trying to purchase bags in advance. Lost our bags and did not communicate well about it. Online assistance doesn't work well either.

2021-06-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Nashville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit is a joke,True," After I paid the initial 200 dollars for tickets, when I arrived at the airport to check in it was an additional 60 dollars per bag no matter carry on or checked. Then it was 20 bucks for you ticket so my trip to Nashville with layover in Orlando added and additional 160 to the original price. Then on the way back home it was the same story with extra prices. But in Fort Lauderdale they said the plane was grounded for 15 min, then we'll tell you what's going on. 1 hr later they said another 15 min. 15 min later they said our flight won't even leave till after an hour after we were supposed to have arrived. I understand they don't control weather and safety is definitely more important than timeliness. But paying an extra 2-3 hundred bucks in hidden fees and I can't get some money back when they can't follow through on their side. Say I had trouble getting to the airport today they wouldn't care If I missed my flight. But it's their fault I'm not getting home to see my family and again it's my financial loss. I've certainly had better experiences with cancelations and delays with different airlines and baggage fees. Spirit is a joke and made it clear all they care about is money.",-1

I fly this route every other week or so and have had more of an overall pleasant journey flying Spirit than flying with United. You have to look at the value for the money. Most of the time United is 400-500 dollars roundtrip IAH-LAS. I can get Spirit for about 220 all in including checked bag and exit row seat. Neither airline gives you a meal, a seat assignment on their basic fares, and honestly Spirit's planes are about 5 years old on average, United's typical A320 or 737-800 on this route average about 20 years old. Look it up yourself. Spirit is no Alaska or JetBlue but again value and experience, IAH-LAS Spirit every time.",1
2021-06-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,think we were being lied to,True,  I was on a family trip with my wife and I. My two kids. Perfect trip to florida. Flew out on frontier airlines. Then we were flying back on spirit. Never had a bad experience before this but felt it deserved a bad review. Was stuck on plane for 2 hours while the workers kept telling us we were waiting on a pilot. First we were told 10 min. Then I recieved a text it would be an hour from Spirit update service. Then they told us that too. Then after 2hrs they said we would be unboarding then to board back up cause pilot was found. I might be crazy but I watched the cabin for the pilots and swear the pilot was already there way earlier. I think we were being lied to which is the part that bothers me the most. Then when we finally took off I figured the least they could do was give us free snacks but that didn't happen. Its too bad but this will be a memory all of my family shares forever. Don't think Spirit airlines will be used in the future.,-1

Customer service is so horrible, never willing to help the customer and the plane is the most uncomfortable plane ever. I thought I’d give it another shot for a second trip but this time their website had a discrepancy and did not add my 11 year old daughter to my trip and when I called customer service they refused to grant us the original price and instead doubled it. They refused to waive the cancellation fee so I had to suck it up and book with them again! Never again will I fly with them. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.",-1
2021-06-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Cancun,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,in desperate need of money,True,"  This is a warning to all travelers. Do Not Book with Spirit Airlines. They will scam you, and before you know it, that other higher priced flight you were eyeballing will become the more affordable option. I booked with Spirit, but had to cancel my flight. I had a credit of $135.08 after fees as the remaining credit. The original cost of the flight was 203.93 not including baggage. Later I go to use this credit and I come to find out that what I have left is $47.08. Baffled by this, I spend about 4 days trying to contact someone in customer service. After waiting 40 minutes to speak to a representative, I barely talk to them 2 minutes before they disconnected me. Next day, I try to reach them via Whatsapp/SMS, that was the worst, I spend a total of 3 days trying to have a consistent conversation with 1 representative about the issue before they change me to a new person again and again- I have to explain everything all over again. Finally I was able to get in touch with their social media representative on instagram, who was the only one I was able to have a complete conversation about the issue. They claimed that the missing credit on my account was due to the the baggage refund I was given by my credit card company. My credit card company told me they could not refund me for the flight ($203.93) because Spirit Airline already refunded me this by giving me a credit of $135.08 . They could however refund me the baggage $88 because it wasn't credited by the airline and also it was a separate service that was purchased but not used. Also this $88 is not included in the $203.93 of original purchase or the $135.08 credit given from that purchase. Spirit Airline, after giving me the $135.08 for my flight credit, decided days after that they would deduct the $88 of that the credit they gave me, because they felt that that $88 was their money. And that was their only explanation. Oh, but also they continued to express that they ""understood"" my frustration. Since they understood my frustration, I've decided to donate the $47 remaining credit to their Customer Service department because it is so understaffed and the individuals are so underpaid, and it appears they are in desperate need of money since they find it easy to steal their customers money. I donate this $47 because I cannot support this company with any more of my money. I will not give a dollar, no a penny, more to a penny-pinching, money-driven, company called Spirit Airlines. Save yourself money, time and effort. Just avoid doing business with this company. Maybe you had a good experience with Spirit one time, but I guarantee it won't be like that every time, because the foundation of their policy is ""How can I better scam you?""",-1

2021-06-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,give me false phone numbers to call,False,"  I suggest never booking a flight with Spirit Airlines. I paid for the insurance just in case I had to cancel my flight because of Covid, which I did. I cannot reach anyone to refund my money. All they would do is give me vouchers. I told them that I wanted a refund not vouchers and all they have done is give me false phone numbers to call. They even gave me a number to a dating site! I have no number to call for the insurance either. I had to file a claim online and never received an email back with any information. I filed a claim with my bank, however Spirit sent proof of the vouchers, so my bank won't let me keep my money either. It is insane as I will never even consider flying Spirit again.",-1
2021-06-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Orlando,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never be flying with them again,True,"  Payed for everything ahead of time, including our one checked bag (which was 48$ before tax), then when we got to the airport, we were charged an extra 60$ for a few pounds over. Flight was fine, pretty turbulent. Anything you wanted was extra, no free snacks or drinks like other airlines. Once we got to our destination and arrived at baggage, it took literally an hour and a half until they unloaded. Absolutely ridiculous. There's a reason they call Spirit the worst airline in the USA. I will never be flying with them again, and I would discourage anyone else from flying with them unless you enjoy having to pay for every little thing, being overcharged, and waiting for hours. I flew Delta the flight before Spirit and it was great. Super comfortable (nice seating with movie screens for everyone, free movies and shows, free snacks and drinks) fair prices, friendly staff, and everything is either on time or before time. Both were economy but night and day differences.",-1

They canceled our flight all together then says it was a mistake so they re booked us again so somehow when they re booked us and the prices went up. We already paid for bags so when they re booked us. From having an issue on there end they say you guys still have to pay for bags. I said we already paid for bag fees. It's nothing but a money scheme with them. They don't take care of their customers when they company make a mistake.,-1

They won't stop talking about ""federal crime"" if the mask isn't worn completely covering the nose and chin. They threaten to wake you up if the mask slips under the nose. Don't worry though, because it's impossible to sleep on this airline. Seats are unable to recline and you are are crammed in tight. Would absolutely never recommend this airline.

They make their ticket prices low so that they are the first to appear on sites like cheap o air or priceline. But what you don't see are the outrageous baggage fees they charge. Anything over 40lbs. gets an extra charge onto an already expensive fee, and if you fly a lot, you know that 40 lbs. is not a lot for a luggage rate. Almost all other airlines consider over 50 lbs. overweight. Then they kill you for carry ons. I had two carry ons that may have been an inch over sized and got charged $130 for them. All airlines have certain carry on sizes, but no other airline I have flown ever really made a deal about the carry on size unless it was outrageously large. Spirit looks to charge you for every little fee they can get you on. Also you might as well be sitting on folding chairs on the plane. I have flown numerous times over the whole world and have never seen a more devious airline in my life. Total rip off.",-1

My last flight was a blast, I really wish I would have gotten the two gentlemen flight attendants names because they both did an amazing job. The one man had an amazing personality and made flying with them fun. Not only did he make everyone feel comfortable and laugh he promoted spirit in a way I thought deserves attention. They both welcomed each guest like a guest in their home. Spirit is making some upgrades and I know I’m pleased to see that they think of their customers in such way.",1

The answers that I received was just a copy and paste of their policy and the phrase ""our policy is not based on lack of compassion"" (this is really sad to hear when you are just trying to find a way to solve a problem). That is it. Would be the first time I would fly with them and it was the last one too because a company that don't care about their customers needs.",-1

Spirit Airlines must deal with a 1,000 or more complaints a day. Not sure how they are still in service and I would not trust the management, or pilots to fly my family anywhere. Horrible customer service and flight scheduling. Don’t be fooled by the “vouchers” that are offered when trying to calm the angry crowds-it is a scam. We tried to redeem $300 worth of vouchers and received only $24 of it bc all the rest are govt fees which cannot be paid by a voucher. You get what you pay for doesn’t even begin to broach the subject. Lack of integrity, lack of basic business practices and total disregard for the customer. Won’t be in business long, imagine the visual of families spending 13 hours sleeping overnight in a Las Vegas airport bc of scheduling ‘mishap” and to be compensated a whopping $8 per flight out of $100 vouchers for new flight offered in compensation. Just say no-never again!",-1

They canceled my flight while we were in the air, they waited until they circled New York twice, about an hour and a half and then decided to take us back to Fort Lauderdale because they were running out of fuel. My flight was rescheduled for two days later heading to Detroit. I live in New York and that's what my ticket was booked for, when we got back to the airport there was so much confusion people were left stranded in Fort Lauderdale airport. Senior citizens and disabled people sleeping on the floor and in wheelchairs. I've never been so humiliated in my life, I had to sleep on the airport bench like a homeless person. This is embarrassing as people walk by me as I'm trying to stay awake until 9am to catch another flight that I had to book with JetBlue for $178. I am so disgusted by my experience with Spirit Airlines that I would never fly with them again or refer anyone to their airline. They even had the nerves to charge people to use their Wi-Fi in a crisis where no one's family members know where they are we would just in the air flying around. They should be ashamed that they charge people for something that they need to let their loved ones know that they were safe and to give them the whereabouts of their next destination. On top of that they did not want to refund me my money and only option they would give me was for a credit. I repeatedly told them that I did not want their service and I would never book another flight with them. I'm traveling alone so I'm afraid for my safety sitting here alone with no one to watch my back while I sleep. This experience is horrible and I would never want this to happen to anyone else so please be aware and do not book your flights with Spirit Airlines.",-1

Only because I was given a travel voucher did I take a risk again 4yrs later and sure enough I am filled with regret. I am trying to get to Vegas for my bachelorette party and it looks like thanks to Spirit that may not happen. Bad service, bad punctuality, and a lackluster flight experience.

Plane did not show up in Houston to take us to Cancun. When it finally arrived, no explanation, no credits, nothing. Just a tin can flight to Mexico in which we hit some storm clouds and the plane literally dropped oso hard and fast the lady in front of me lost her hat off her head. On our return home our flight was so delayed (with no explanation) we ate the tickets and booked a $700 flight home on Delta. We requested a refund.

The attendant at the Spirit Airlines check-in at Newark airport was rude and got offended because I could not understand what she was saying (very heavy accent). The seat space on the plane is non-existent, the flight attendants were ok. However, because the seats had no space, I was awakened every time the person behind me needed to use the bathroom or the food tray on the back of my seat. The next day when I tried calling to change my return flight, over a period of two days, no one answered the phone. I waited for a total of about 3 hours!

One month before our flight I got an email about a change in the time of the flight and an added stop, two days later was another change in the time of flight, two days later another change except the flight was a day later. It was such a hassle to change the car rental and hotel that we will never flying Spirit again, it cost us more money in the end!",-1

I purchased a ticket to fly from Boston at 2.29 pm for a straight flight to Vegas. I was to leave Vegas at 10.15pm to return to Boston. I bought tickets early to get a good deal. Spirit offered the best round trip deal so I was pleased. Then a few weeks later I got an email changing my flight from Boston to 9.29am with a four and a half hour layover in Florida! I would never have purchased this flight! They also changed my return flight from 10.15 pm to 8.30am! When I called they told me that the original flight no longer exists! Never again!,-1
2021-05-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Boston via Baltimore,,,,,,,2.0,never book with Spirit again,True,  I had booked early March for a flight late May. Spirit never notified me by email or a call as to the changes in schedule and itinerary. I would have left Atlanta GA at 7:15 am and flown to Boston MA through Orlando FL The return would have been at 5:20 am through Orlando FL again. It took hours to speak to a representative and receive a credit for the flights ad baggage fees. I shall never book with Spirit again and I shall discourage others to do so.,-1

I would rather pay triple the price than travel with Spirit. They changed my flight last minute and added a stop to my round trip. My flight was supposed to be an hour and a half and it ended up being a ten hour flight. Spirit did not offer any form of compensation. I called and asked to change my flight and they did nothing at all. Very rude customer service. I do not recommend Spirit Airlines to anyone!,-1
2021-05-18,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,unprofessional on Spirit's behalf,False,"  We arrived at the airport for a 7:59 PM flight out of Charlotte to Fort Lauderdale around 5:15 PM. The flight was delayed and delayed and delayed and we kept getting informed of this. This occurred several times over several hours. At 12:30 AM we were told that the flight was delayed until 9:30 AM. At this point every single person who was on this flight was frustrated. This was absolutely ridiculous and completely unprofessional on Spirit's part. As if this wasn't bad enough the flight was yet again delayed. Around 4:30 AM we were informed that we would not be flying out until 12:00 PM. At this point I called Spirit and spoke with an agent who was absolutely no help at all. Everyone was told that the only thing that we could do was file and emailed complaint. This is completely unprofessional on Spirit's behalf. If there are issues and a customer wants to file a complaint there should be a person with whom to speak with who can handle the situation and solve the problem. The flight was delayed again 3 or 4 times before we finally flew out around 5:00 PM the next day. All we were offered was a $7 per person meal voucher that could only be used at the airport. The Spirit attendant at the airport was not apologetic at all and in fact stated ""I had to sleep here tonight too."" She got PAID to sleep at the airport. We LOST money on a hotel that was already paid for. This was the worst flight experience I have ever had. 24 hours spent in an airport and Spirit did nothing to solve the issue or apologize.  Spirit could have brought another plane to fly us out, brought another crew to fly us out, bumped us to other airlines or offered to compensate the lost hotel or the flight. Needless to say we will never fly Spirit again!",-1

I have been flying with spirit airlines for years now. I know my backpack is adequate to be brought on the plane, not as a carry on. On my way back to Boston they stopped me and forced me to pay the $55 charge cause they claimed it to be a “carry on”. Never flying with them again. They are scam artists and will do anything to get extra money from money from people.",-1

I live two hours from the airport. Called and the wait time was almost 3 hours, the customer rep told me I can change to a different time, but it would cost me twice the price of the original ticket and for a later date. I found a ticket with Alaska for cheaper than the change and on the correct day. Customer rep offered no help or solutions at all.",-1

As a captain, and crew member of a major airline, my intention was to Non Rev with my wife as we were sharing 1 crew member approved bag between us. It has 4 crew member tags with an additional embossed name on my bag. Having broken my lower left leg 2 days earlier, we thought it best to purchase tickets to MCO. Arriving at the gate, the gate agent coldly with no compassion decided to charge me an additional $55 dollars to bring my crew bag aboard. I was walking with an orthopedic boot and a walker during this counter exchange. Is this How others in the airline industry treat their fellow brothers and airline employees during a time of need? Personally, I find this distasteful. Really despicable… good thing I’m a professional and gentleman.",-1

Got to airport to check in for my 11.30pm flight, was told my flight was changed with no warning, now I'm stuck at airport until 5am and my flight went from being a direct flight of 4 hours to a flight with one stop for a duration of 12 hours.

First, our flight status was changed three separate times and for each change, there was 0 notification/email saying the status change. The only reason we were able to find it was because we were periodically checking the app. Charges for WiFi but the connection is extremely sub par, even for paying extra to stream. Cheap ticket but after a $50 checked bag fee, I told myself I should have just paid more to fly Southwest because the difference would have been about the same as buying a full Southwest Airlines ticket. Flight crew was very friendly though, but never flying again.",-1
2021-05-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Tampa,,,,,,1.0,1.0,customer service is abysmal,True,"  Spirit is cheap which makes it accessible for many who cannot afford other airlines. However it only appears less expensive. You will end up spending as much or more than other airline. My flight was canceled after being delayed for six hours. As the line of unhappy passengers lined up at the counter to deal with this change, the short-staffed manager began speaking to everyone like THEY were the problem, even threatening to call the police. I appreciate Spirit's safety minded flight crew and mechanics. Their customer service is abysmal. Ultimately the inexpensive trip cost me an additional $500 in non-refundable hotel fees and the last minute purchase of another flight on a competitor's airline. I will be avoiding Spirit with every fiber in my being for the rest of my traveling days.",-1
2021-05-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cabo,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Worst airline and customer service,True,"  Worst airline and customer service. I was waiting to check in to my flight, and the two agents working at the desks were very slow and took far too long to check others in the line. There were many others in the line who were in the same position I was in, and due to the lack of service from the Spirit employees, they also were declined access to their flight. I was highly disappointed when I finally got to my turn, and the agent told me I was not allowed to check my luggage. It was 2 minutes after the hour mark before the flight, and they declined me. Even though I waited in line for over an hour and a half, I was denied access to check in my luggage. The attendant said that I could only bring carryons to the flight, so I was willing to leave my baggage behind. Still, because she had wasted my time talking about nothing, the Spirit employee then told me that the gate for my flight closed 30 minutes prior to departure and I would not be allowed to get on the plane. This is extremely disappointing because if the agent had been more proficient with her time, I and many others could have been able to get on my flight on time. I had also purchased Shortcut Security and Shortcut Boarding, which proved to be useless since none of the employees knew about the extra packages and did not serve as helpful. Also, I waste a whole day trying to check in which was a disaster and I had to call 3 times to finally be able to do so.",-1

2021-05-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Newark via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2.0,This is the worst experience,True,"  This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Not only did they change my direct flight from Nashville TN to Newark NJ to a flight with a lay over in fort lauderdale of 4 hours waiting time, but both aircrafts departed late because they had “maintenance issues”. What kind of airline is not on top of their aircraft enough to have them out on time? Specially over something as sensitive as maintenance issues! That is not the most secure feeling when you take off in an aircraft that is taking off late and arriving late to your destination because there’s something wrong with it. I have a reservation in New Jersey at 6pm that now I am not going to make it too, so thank you for ruining my mother’s 60th birthday party surprise. Not only is the lateness an issue, boarding was an absolute mess, some of the flight attendants were super rude to people for the slightest issue, like someone putting their bag in the wrong overhead bin. Let this be the last time I fly with Spirit, I had never gotten such bad service from them, but now I see what people refer to when they say this airline is the worst, it definitely is.",-1
2021-05-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Medellin via West Palm Beach,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this was absolutely the worst experience I have ever encountered,True," Under any circumstances do not fly Spirit Airlines. The most non-existent and worst customer service I have ever experienced with any company. You can never, ever speak to a human. After on-line agent entered the wrong information on a change I was making to my ticket, I spent from just after 9 in the morning until 5.45 in the evening on line waiting for someone to ""chat"" with or to be elevated to another level in customer service. What was even more wonderful is that I was in Colombia South America. Ultimately I had to pay for a new flight home because of their mistake, was told at the Colombian ticket counter I would have to pay for a carry-on which I had already paid for, and was treated as if they did me a favor for even allowing to board. If I was given a choice to fly Spirit to Colombia again or swim, I would choose to swim. If you have had a good experience with them that means you never needed to make a change or try to get in touch with customer service. When this is necessary for you, then you will leave the same review. In all my years of flying this was absolutely the worst experience I have ever encountered. I feel robbed by Spirit Airlines.",-1
2021-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worse customer service ever,True,  Worse customer service ever. I was about an 1hr and 30 mins early to the airport before my flight left. My light was schedule to leave at 1:44 pm was waiting in the check Lane line which was at least an he wait. Got a text saying my flight had been delayed to 2:20 pm (great gave me a little more time to get Thur TSA and to the gate) went to check my bag and told me I was to late for my flight 50 mins before the 2:20 mark. They said the flight was on time and I should have been earlier to the flight. Not once did they call out in the check bag line for anyone on that flight. We had been in the check bag line for at least an hr. They did not help a single one of us and had no explanation to why this happened would not give us another flight out and wanted another 100 on top of what we had already paid for there mistake? To me this is the worst thing you could ever do to a person. You really expect someone to get there early wait in line for over an hr to just be told we can not do anything for you because “YOU MISSED THE FLIGHT” I didn’t miss my flight I was there in plenty of time and they just didn’t even care we were in line waiting or to even call out for our flight.  And the other 6 people who got screwed over could tell you the same thing. I will be calling and posting as many complaints as possible about this company. Because not did they only screw me out of my money there was also 6 others “who missed their flights”. I would maybe I would understand a little more if it was just me but the fact that there was 6 other passengers in line which makes me think it is the airlines fault.,-1
2021-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Austin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,They cannot be trusted to deliver,False,  I was supposed to be flying home tomorrow with my mother from Cancun to Austin direct. When I went to check in I find out the flight is cancelled. They didn’t even message us to let us know. I tried calling and couldn’t get through so I was able to communicate through text. They confirmed the flight was cancelled but not to worry because we now had a credit we could use through September. Oh wow! What a great deal! I guess let’s just stay in Mexico. I had to then buy us new tickets the day before travel on a new airline at 2x the cost. Bottom line - do not fly this airline! They cannot be trusted to deliver and what was a “good deal” is now a liability. I can guarantee I will not risk flying them again.,-1
2021-05-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas,,,,,,,1.0,Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with,False,"  Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. First they changed the flight six times, I show up and they check my bag. Then I get a ticket and the 'help person' throws my ticket in the trash and says my flight ticket is no good! I inform them I need my bag at this point to go figure out what’s going on. So I call the next day because it is late and I can’t find a real person to talk to over the phone. The next day I get someone and they tell me they can’t refund the cost of the ticket and make me feel like a liar! I will never fly Spirit again! What a horrible company they are to treat their customers that way!",-1
2021-05-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Philadelphia,,,,,,,1.0,This airline has no honesty,True,"  I booked this flight on March 29th. I bought and paid the upgrade to seats 2A and 2C (Big Front Seats) on both flights. Both were available, and I bought and paid for both. A month later I received a call from Spirit Air that my return flight seats were changed to the first row. I told them that was not acceptable. I am a senior citizen handicapped with heart disease, COPD and diabetes. Worst of all I have been diagnosed with claustrophobia. There is a wall in front of the 1st row seats that is a problem for me. In addition, there is a wall behind the 2nd row seats which protects me from someone kicking my seat. They insisted that seat 2C was purchased before me but how could that be if this seat showed available when I bought and paid for it. This airline customer service is terrible. Once a staff member realizes that I am right and I am not going away they tell me they are not authorized to help me and transfers me to someone else that requires a 45 minute hold. The do not care about compliance to the Americans with Disabilities act which protects people with claustrophobia. This airline has no honesty, they are ignorant and do not have a clue as to what good customer service is.",-1

The plane space was tiny, seats do not recline back and you’re basically sitting shoulder to shoulder with the people beside you. At disembarking everyone just gets up and the flight attendants usually say nice things like have a nice day or what not, in this case they did not do so. Every flight so far on Spirit has been the opposite, they do not care for their customers. I would not recommend flying with Spirit",-1

I’ve been trying to contact customer service for 3 days. Been on hold at least 30 minutes for every call even calling several times a day. No answer. Called in again but this time I selected to purchase a new ticket in the option menu and someone immediately picked up. What a joke of an airline. No wonder they’re hemorrhaging money.

I tried to submit a damaged claim the day after we were home and their website would not work for me. I have chatted and called their customer service multiple times and not one person would or could help me. I finally sent everything in the mail and I chatted today to check on it and they told me I was past my four days to submit the claim. I again them explained everything and was told to call a number. I submitted two complaints and nothing still has been done. Their customer service is horrible and their handling of baggage as well.

I purchased on Spirit as the gate was next the carry on bag even though it as considered personal item just to me sure I would not get dinged at airport and chose my seat paying for both at the time of reservation. Immediately ( within 10 minutes) of booking, I tried to change it as I made it for the wrong day. I found I could not without pay a $79 cancellation or change fee. I called and after waiting for quite some time was told I was out of luck but could have a travel voucher for the remaining value of the ticket. Very poor customer service in that regard.

They ask you to be at the airport at the original flight time and even if you are in the airport, they do not update any information board to let you know that the flight is boarding!

2021-04-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,angry with your services today,True,"  I am very frustrated, upset and totally angry with your services today. Tthe flight was delayed 4 times. Boarding started for this flight at 8:00 pm. I boarded at 8:14 pm. We were on the plane until approximately 9:28 pm. During this time there was no air circulating, no Covid prevention, no water offer and no explanation. With no circulating air my migraine headache was triggered and I had nothing to drink. I needed some water after seating in this hot plane and need to take some medicine, (I am 66 years old with type 2 diabetic and high blood pressure), I was told a bottle of water would be $3.00. The young man sitting beside me was having a panic attack or something and it was frightening.  Finally at 11:07 pm the man on the isle seat contacted the Attendant and she rearranged the seating. She also offered me a water. I am so dissatisfied and disappointed with this trip. The delay was awful and the time sitting 1 hour and a half was excruciating and frightening. We never heard anything from the Captain and only had one brief announcement from the Flight Attendant after 45 minutes and nothing else. They were not Customer Service friendly at all.",-1
2021-04-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to New Orleans,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,Their customer service is even worse than the flights,False,"  Paid for a direct flight, which was changed to a 2 hour layover in Florida. This layout was delayed several times and I sat in the airport for over 4 hours, not arriving to my destination until after 5pm (originally was to be there at 9am). That is not even the worst, they changed my flight and had me returning a whole day earlier. This was done without any notice provided to me. They then refused me a refund, only wanting to give a credit — like I would ever fly with them again. If I was stranded on an island and that was the only airline available, call me Gilligan. Their customer service is even worse than the flights. I was on hold for about 45 minutes before someone picked up the first time and 35 minutes the second time. My third call was a 27 minute wait before someone picked up but said nothing as I kept saying hello. They were there because I heard talking in the background. I am contacting my bank to stop payment, since I had to pay $471 to Delta to come home from vacation.",-1
2021-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never again will I fly this airline,False,"  Ruined our vacation! I missed two days of my family reunion because they kept changing our flights. We had paid for a direct flight but they sent us to other cities. I had to pay for two hotel rooms. Sat over 14 hours in airports trying to get to family reunion and then back home. We had checked in at 10:35 am to come home and then was not allowed on flight because"" you didn't check in"". How do they think we got past security and had a boarding pass with the flight number, assigned seat and my name on it? We had checked in. Ended up sitting over 8 hours just to finally board and get back to Dallas. Because of them, spent together over $600.00 on hotels, food, luggage check in and just to have water they expected money. Fly them if you have no important even to get to. Never again will I fly this airline.",-1
2021-04-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,This trip was awful and I did not appreciate it at all,True," This trip was awful and I did not appreciate it at all. Service was rude including the supervisor on duty leaving out on April 16th 2021. I had a carry on bag that I’ve been using with no issue at all and they had the nerve to tell me it wouldn’t fit and I’d have to pay $65, I made it clear that I’ve been traveling with the bag and that it is carry on and I’ve had no issues! I then had to take my things out which fit two small plastic clear zip bags and carry it both ways on my trip. The trip was also an emergency. The supervisor ignored me until I called a family member to let them know what was going on and heard my family say we will transfer the money to your bank. The supervisor then proceeded to say I well if they are going to pay don’t take your things out. I looked her in her eyes and said they won’t be paying and I’ll be carrying my things. I feel I didn’t have your attention when needed remember you are the supervisor and there’s nothing you can do then just turn your back on me until you over hear my phone conversation. I’ve been flying with this airline with no issue for years even with a bigger carry on so yes mind blowing and upsetting.",-1
2021-04-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Cancun via Orlando,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1.0,I wish I'd have never taken the trip,False,"  Worst flight experience of my life. My flight was canceled a week before my trip and I was never notified. Thankfully I checked the status myself and saw it had been canceled two days prior to my departure. When I called I was told the only other option was an additional $1,500 ($460 of which was baggage fees that I was never informed of - more than my original tickets total!). I went ahead and reserved this flight for fear of it being last minute. I called an hour later to cancel the whole trip and was told that that was not possible because it was within seven days of departure. I explained the situation and was told that it wasn't their problem because it was policy. So although it was an hour after the call I made and they'd never informed me of the cancellation of my original flight, it was now a nightmare for me which they had no intention of helping with for their part in it. I also was unable to get refunded for the additional baggage fees that I wasn't informed of - I reminded them that they record all calls for ""quality assurance"" to prove my case and they couldn't have cared less. Fast forward to the flights themselves and the spotty service and needless to say I wish I'd have never taken the trip I'd looked forward to for months. A few of the flight attendants were kind, but every flight seemed to have one bad apple. Not to mention the $3 charge for a stinking bottle of water! Is anything included with them anymore?",-1
2021-04-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Indianapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,True," We arrived more than 2 hours before the flight and were at the gate more than an hour and 30 minutes before the flight was to leave. An hour before takeoff it was announced that the flight was delayed by 3 hours. We were OK with that, understanding things happen. Then 30 minutes later it was announced that the flight was cancelled. I talked with a few Spirit employees and their attitude was that they could not care less. We went to the ticket counter and the guy said the earliest flight we could get on was 8 days later. I asked for a refund. I will never fly Spirit again. Spirit is cheap but they have no problem screwing you to save money. We eventually rented a car and drove 19 hours home which cost over $1000.",-1
2021-04-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,disrespectful and unprofessional individuals,True,"  This flight crew was the most disrespectful and unprofessional individuals you can imagine. I have an autistic child who started to cry hysterical due to fear of being in the airplane. Before we took, of one of the flight attendant was just coldly saying that mask must be fully on on child. Remember my child having anxiety and crying. None of the crew member tried to come and calm my child or offer anything to us to get my son to calm down. After being seated for 5 minutes literally they asked us to calm him down or we have to leave the flight. I was shocked and mortified with the way we were treated and tears just started rolling my eyes thinking of how awful some people can be. I left with 4 other family member the flight. A gentleman who works there was really trying to help us find next available flight which took some time. But he was nice enough to find us a flight. We ended up taking the flight to Baltimore. The crew there was absolutely wonderful and made us not feel like we are aliens. My child was hysterically crying again but once we were up in the sky he calmed down. Everyone on the flight was understanding and wonderful. Please who ever that crew was on this particular flight was disgusting and should not be working in this field since they are clearly not able to handle any tough situations with upmost respect. I will never fly again with Spirit due to this experience. It’s a 7 year old child crying out of fear. Are you kidding me??",-1
2021-04-17,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Orlando, FL to Boston, MA",2.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,it was a very pleasant and easy experience,False,"  Spirit is a great airline choice! The tickets were cheap and very convenient! It is a great, inexpensive airline, stripped of all of the unnecessary apparatus that other airlines have. All that being said, I would recommend Spirit for shorter flights, where comfort doesn't really matter. The seats are small and sparse. I would also recommend Spirit for singles with little luggage because it could be really cheap. I was worried by the terrible reviews online, but it was a very pleasant and easy experience. Get to your flight on time, follow the guidelines, and you'll enjoy your flight with Spirit.",1
2021-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Lima,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never fly with this airline,False,"  Never fly with this airline. I would give them 0 stars if that were an option. I reached my boarding gates with a negative antigen Covid test in hand, but because the test results were not written in lamens terms and did not specifically state “antigen” test on the document, I was denied boarding - rudely and blatantly. The crew were extremely rude and slammed the boarding doors closed in my face. It ended up costing me over $400 to rebook my flights with another airline, and get a hotel. They told me there was nothing they could do for me and that the next departing flight was one week away. I cannot believe this airline is in business. It is the worst experience I have ever had flying in my entire life. Strongly recommend anyone considering flying with them to stay away.",-1

Plane is sitting on the tarmac. No crew. Too stupid to bring crew from CAK 40 min away. Delays started popping up at 6pm, never told until 10.00 pm when people were loosing their cool as to why this was happening. Never ever fly with Spirit Airlines. It's my birthday and I am not with my friends who all had no problem getting to Atlanta on other airlines.",-1

Out of no where and for no reason, Spirit modified my direct flight to a flight with a 2 and over 4 hour layover. I purposely booked a direct flight because do to medical issue I cannot travel for long time periods. It is impossible to get anyone on the phone, i have waited on hold for hours and no one responds. They are refusing so accommodate and honor the direct flight ticket that i purchased. How are they allowed to do things like this? This is unfair!",-1
2021-04-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Hartford,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,They provided no help or guidance,False,"  Absolutely horrible airline! From the ticketing to the bag drop to the Captain of the plane. On April 11 at FLL airport, plane waits at the gate for what was supposed to be, per the captain, on Flight #1812, ""Baggage check paperwork"". While we are waiting, 8 more people board the plane. Not a baggage check, the flight waited so Spirit could fill the plane and make more $$. Meanwhile 30 minutes has expired and a storm system had been developing. Make our way out onto the runway and again we are delayed. This time due to the ATC not giving us clearance due to weather. Another 30 minutes goes by and Captain says please wear your masks this a federal law. 15 minutes later, the Captain says, ""I have good news and bad news. Good news is we have clearance to takeoff and are 3rd in line. The Bad news is we have to return to gate because two passengers did not comply with mask wearing"". Then after 20 minutes more Captain says ""flight is cancelled"" after everyone on the plane received an email saying flight is cancelled due to weather. This was the most unprofessional Captain I have ever heard on a loudspeaker. Why would you ever announce that 2 people caused the flight to return. How about the 8 people you waited for? Things became progressively worse as no one from Spirit Airlines knew anything and gave passengers no help. No hotel stay. This flight should have left. We should not have waited for 8 passengers to fill the plane. People who work for Sprit are rude and frankly unprofessional. They provided no help or guidance.",-1
2021-04-15,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,I had a terrible experience on this flight,True," I had a terrible experience on this flight, person got sick so they had to clean up the mess take the guy off the plane, clean the plane, taxi back, wait in line again to take off which caused me to be an hour and a half late with my ride. Had to get a different ride which cost me twice as much. Now I'm sitting in Michigan trying to get back to Phoenix, again the airline is going to be late and it's going to cost me more money to get a ride in Phoenix when I get home. This is completely unacceptable, no other airline I've flown has had so many problems. I will never use this airline again, if and when I get back to Phoenix I will let you know more. The plane coming to Detroit from Tampa was dirty, floors not swept, I know it is an economy flight but no reason to not clean your plane after each flight. I am not a happy camper.",-1

They delayed the flight two hours after they already started boarding (some had to get back off) because they just realized the pilots were in Louisiana. They won’t let us leave the gate, though, in case they randomly find a pilot. Ridiculous and poor planning. The attendant said it was their 'schedules'.",-1

I booked the flight tickets a month in advance so that they would be cheaper. We were supposed to depart at midnight and return on April 12 at 7am (overnight) and I had planned to go to work that day, However, Spirit sent a message at 6pm the day of departure saying the flight was delayed 1 hour. Then, when we arrived at LAX, we waited in TSA for over an hour (no social distancing at all and people weren't even wearing their masks, nobody was enforcing it!). We then found out that our flight was delayed another two hours after waiting again until 1.30am. At this point we weren't due to depart until 3.45am. After waiting until 3am, they finally told everyone on all the Spirit flights that they were all cancelled. So over 150 people (including myself) rushed down to the front desk and sat in a line for another hour only to be told that we can wait in a separate line to get a refund (another hour). It was too late to get a hotel or even ask a friend from the city to pick us up and stay with them since it was like 4am. Spirit did not provide anything to make up for this. No hotel, nothing! So everyone was forced to sleep in the airport on the floor since there weren't enough seats. We ended up having to buy a $500 last second one-way ticket on a 12 hour flight with Delta (the airline we should have chosen instead) because Spirit told us that they could put us on the next flight which wasn't for another 5 days! One of the people in line told me that she has been stuck in LA for 2 days because of Spirit canceling on her twice! Absolutely ridiculous that they can get away with this! They also lied and said that the reason for canceling was because of weather conditions, but we later found out that this was false! All the other airlines were still functioning and there was no bad weather at all! Spirit Airlines is the worst airline ever.",-1
2021-04-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2.0,Upset customers everywhere,False,"  Flight to Las Vegas was fine. Cramped and completely packed in like a can of sardines. Layover in Chicago. Got off and right back on same plane. Plane delayed landing by 1 hour due to storm. However, once at baggage waited more than hour and only received 1 of 2 bags. Waited almost another full hour along with 300 people. Upset I went to baggage claims and they only gave me a card with a QR code. I asked for a number to call and it did not work- busy then hung up. No empathy or care for customer. Asked for manager and they never showed up. Waited for over 1 hour on Mgr. Several other customers had waited 5 hours to get their bags. Upset customers everywhere needless to say. I have tried every online number and they either hang up on you or send you a text. I have tried for 3 days now to get a response. The only thing I know is they took my bag off the plane in Chicago - why? I got back on the same plane. This company is glad to take your money, just hope you don't have an issue. Good luck on getting a response. They don't seem to care about repeat business. Poor business model. Avoid this company at all cost. Save yourself some pain.",-1

I got to the airport in Houston about 2 hours before my flight yesterday and as I was at the kiosk to check in they canceled my flight and rebooked it to a week later! The person I was traveling with got a totally different flight as well, so we then went and got in line and after two hours of no one being able to tell us anything and the line not moving at all they fully said is was weather ( which was not true) when we finally got to talk to someone they were extremely rude and told us they could refund our money or get us on a flight next week and not on the same day. Obviously not going to work. They then proceeded to tell us they would not put us in a hotel or comp us for food or anything, I asked where I was supposed to sleep for 7 days and the lady told me to figure it out myself. We were flying home after a vacation so we didn’t have much money left and all other airlines were still flying but they were $700+ So we were supposed to just be stranded at the Huston airport for 7 days.  Luckily we drove to Austin and Allegiant and they got us home. So not only did they lie about why they flight got canceled but they also expected us to sleep in an airport and starve for 7 days.",-1

I don’t know what kind of airline service this run but that is not it! People were forced to sleep in an airport over night and they couldn’t even accommodate anyone with anything! They basically refunded us and told us to kick rocks. They said my flight was rescheduled to Saturday. They cancelled my flight on a Monday night. They big tripping forreal. I suggest some re-evaluation be taken place within the company and hire some  back up pilots.,-1

We board the plane and after an hour of sitting there waiting for takeoff we get a message over the PA that we have to deplane because the Captains have not arrived to fly the plane. This is understandable because they were under extended rest. I get it. But when we left to board the next flight, we were late because we didn’t get the notification or the announcement that Spirit Airlines was ready to take off. We are not having to wait overnight in ATL airport for our next flight. I’ve always read bad reviews about this airline, I give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Our bags that we had checked have made it to their destination, we have not and I have medicine on my bags that must be taken before bedtime. Now I’m stuck in ATL airport over night because Spirit Airlines is the worst airline! The only saving grace is that I’m stuck here with the love of my life.",-1

The plane was 2 hours late picking us up from Columbus Ohio due to weather conditions. We then flew to Tampa Florida where I had a connecting flight to San Juan Puerto Rico, when we landed in Tampa the plane for Puerto Rico was still in Tampa however we sat there for over an hour because Spirit had mechanical issues so we were unable to pull up to a gate. When the gate was finally available the pilot came on the mic and stated the gate was now available but the Spirit plane for San Juan just took off. This ruined my whole vacation the next flight was not available until the next day around 9pm. They refused to accommodate for your hotel stay and on top of that all hotels including the Marriott at the TPA were sold out so I had to sleep at the airport.",-1

Spirit only had three tellers working. Took over an hour to pass off my bag. The tellers were unorganized and rude. People are in a panic because I didn’t even pass off my bag and my plane was already boarding. No sympathy at all. No urgency. I was running through the airport just to make it to my gate and almost missed my flight. Between all the hidden fees for this company and the long waits I will never fly with this company ever again.,-1

He did not try to descend to get out of it, just rode through it for lord knows how long. Only after it was over did he tell us what was going on. Staff were very unprofessional and did not try to comfort anyone. I've been on a plane flying 13 hours to South Korea and did not experience anything like that.

She’d been sitting in the airport since 3pm. Just as they were about to board, they announced the flight was cancelled. There were no apologies, no accommodations made for my friend who was stuck at the airport, and I ended up getting a hotel room in Baltimore because I was not going to turn around and drive another two hours back home. This was my friend’s first time using Spirit Airlines, and I can assure you it will be her last. I personally have never used Spirit, and after this experience, I certainly never will. The customer service was awful, the attitudes of all the employees including flight attendants was very nasty, and overall my friend and I have had to shell out more money than we expected.",-1

It was my first time flying. We missed our flight and had to get rebooked. The staff who rebooked us did it wrong and we had no check in’s, carry on’s, or the dogs we had paid for, which wasn’t cheap, when we had checked in to get our tickets for our second flight. We had to wait in line for over an hour. The agent who helped us could see we had paid for everything already, but he couldn’t help. We either had to call reservations and miss our flight again or I could pay for it and get my money back. I paid for it because I was not missing the flight again. Now getting the money back is a pain. Been on 2 phone calls for over an hour and was told at first I wasn’t able to get my money back on the phone. I had to text a live agent. I do so and every time I give my Credentials and confirmation number nobody answers back. It’s been 4 days and I have yet to get in contact with anyone. I’ve been stuck at square one for days. With how much my boyfriend and I spent on this flight we could have flown first class. It’s been hours upon hours since I was told someone is going to help me.

Yes they may be cheap but cheapness comes with a price to pay. They over charge for bags and food. Its a pandemic and they are over charging. Let me not talk about the customer service that I was on hold waiting for over 2 hours. This is ridiculous. Some of there employees are very nasty and rude. They may look presentable but when they open their mouth they are very disrespectful and have no empathy for the people who are buying tickets to pay their bills.

This caused issues with my Airbnb booking, and now I have to spend money on changing my transportation after I land which I already booked, and also my Airbnb. Ridiculous.

Our first attempt was in March 2020, but our cruise out of Florida was canceled due to COVID (not the fault of Spirit). However, when I tried to cancel our flights, they charged us $100 per ticket (x 4), even though they later offered free cancellations due to COVID. I then tried to use some of our remaining credit for a flight in July 2020 from PDX-DEN. The flight booked included a total travel time of 5-1/2 hours with a layover, but Spirit changed the flight and the new trip would have been nearly 14 hours! I canceled and booked with Delta. I later booked a flight in Oct 2020 from DEN-ORD with a total travel time of 2-1/2 hours, and Spirit changed the flight to go all the way to Ft. Lauderdale and back to Chicago for a flight time of 9 hours! I canceled this trip also. I then booked a nonstop flight for this May 2021 from DEN-DTW with a total flight time of about 2-1/2 hours and the flight was changed to go from Denver to Las Vegas to Detroit, with a total travel time of over 11 hours! I canceled this flight and booked with United. The other flights I have booked for this coming May have also had all of their itineraries changed, adding over 6 hours of travel time to my itinerary and requiring us to arrive at our destination late and to leave early! I cannot stress strongly enough to avoid Spirit Airlines at all costs! We only booked our original cruise flights because we were heading to Florida during spring break 2020 and they were the only airline with reasonable fares ($1,415 for four travelers with bags). The headache we've experienced since that time trying to use our Spirit credit (and the fact they charged us to cancel our original flights), have proven Spirit to be a terrible choice when it comes to airline travel.",-1
2021-04-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to New Orleans,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,I’ll never fly with Spirit again,False,"  Flew to New Orleans the flight was good, on the way back home we had an overlay, we in up in Orlando then our flight home was canceled from 4-11.30 I stood in a customer service line with everyone else on that flight trying to figure out what to do. I ended up booking another flight with United because Spirit was saying that they were only offering flights 2 days from the flight cancellation and I never asked to be in Florida and was only supposed to be there to switch flights on my way back home. I ended up having a seizure when we started landing I can honestly say spirit stressed me out to that point and I’ll never fly with Spirit again.",-1
2021-04-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New Jersey,,,,,,1.0,1.0,said it was my fault I didn't make the flight,False,"  I was flying out to be at a close friend's wedding. Apparently, I was late for check-in. Check-in was at 6:15. I checked in at 6:20, well attempted to anyway, at the kiosk. I was bounced around to a few people until I got to someone at the entrance of the baggage check-in line. She told me I was late for my flight (It wasn't scheduled to leave until a little after 7). They made me wait in line to speak to an agent (10 minute wait). Only for the agent to tell me I have to go to rebooking (another 15 minute wait because they were late). I didn't have any bags to check in. It was just my personal bag. They gave me some answer saying ""when you purchased your ticket you agreed to be here an hour before the flight. We allow 45 minutes before but only as a courtesy for people. It's in the fine print. When you acknowledged it we assumed you understood it"". Obviously I neither they or I have proof of that statement. Even if I could prove it, it was already around the time of boarding the flight so it wouldn't have done me any good. I even mentioned in all of my confirmation emails they emphasized online check ins but NOT ONCE does it mention their ""in person check-in requirement"". And that I didn't do the online check-in because I had no way to print the boarding pass.  They told me the next flight was on Monday. And If I wanted to be on standby, I would have to confirm another flight first but they would NOT issue me a refund. Like it would've taken me all of 15 minutes. 20 minutes MAX to make it through security. They held me up and then said it was my fault I didn't make the flight.",-1
2021-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Columbus,1.0,,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,they are waiting for the pilot,True,"  My wife and 4 kids flew from Columbus OH to Orlando FL last week of March for spring break vacation. The flight was delayed for one hour. When I flew back with my family from Orlando to Columbus April 1 the flight was initially delayed for about 4 hours then spirit announced that the flight was cancelled after we passed the security point. Of course we have to walk all the way back to ticketing encounter. The first available flight from Orlando was 4 days later ANDwe have to take care of lodging. Since I can’t do that as I have to go back to work, I have to get the next day flight on April 2 from Tampa about one hour drive from Orlando. I took a taxi and booked a hotel in Tampa which costed me around 450 dollars. The flight was supposed to depart at 2:22 pm. We boarded to the plane on time. But spirit airlines deplaned all the passengers about one hour later. The crew said they are waiting for the pilot who has not arrived yet. Finally the plane departed 5:10 pm, about 3 hours delay.",-1

Don't be fooled by lowish prices. At the end of the day, after all your extra fees, you will most likely pay significantly higher fees than just flying a reputable airline. Very unorganized. I paid $54 for a bag that fit perfectly under my seat. Save your money and frustration and fly another airline. Other passengers expressing the same and similar frustration. Leg room seems smaller than other airlines I've flown.",-1

After talking with several managers all I was told was that they would give me my money back. Spirit Airlines is the worst airline.",-1
2021-04-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I missed my first flight,False,"  I missed my first flight for a round trip flight so I had to find another way to get to my destination. I thought I could take my 2nd flight back because I had still paid for it but on the day of the flight I found out that if you miss the first flight in a round trip, they automatically cancel your 2nd flight without any notification. I paid for both flights and I understand it was my fault that I missed the first flight, but at no point was I notified that my 2nd flight was cancelled even though I had paid for it. Spirit won’t even give me a credit for the 2nd flight to use on my next flight.",-1

2021-03-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Kansas City,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Not a happy customer,False,"  Never again!! I repeat never again! Do not use this airline. I booked a trip for my children for a vacation and paid in full online. Arriving at the airport this morning to board the plane at 8am in Orlando they would not allow them to board. Said they upgraded seats which was a lie. And even if they did and couldn’t pay for them we already booked seats. So as of right now, today 3/30/21 my kids are stuck in Orlando not knowing anybody until the next flight leaving at 10.40pm. I had to cash app them money to pay more for them to be able to catch the next flight when this trip was paid in full a month ago. Not a happy customer. Talk with customer service and they were very rude and would not listen. 15 hours in an airport because this airline would not let them board the plane. I will never I repeat never use this airline again.",-1
2021-03-30,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Las Vegas,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised,True,"  I was all ready for a bad experience on my flight but I was pleasantly surprised. Outside of the seats being small and not very comfortable, our Flight Attendants and all staff were so pleasant. Even when I wasn't so sure about my bag being in the guidelines the gate agent helped me with my bag. The flight attendants were so friendly and funny. On our trip back the Flight attendants were not nearly as friendly but more matter of fact, but it didn't matter as we made it to our trip safe and made it back safe and on time.",1
2021-03-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,You get what you pay for,True," The worst experience I have ever had flying anywhere. It started checking in our bags when we were shamed for being there an hour early. We were told that our bags might not make the flight. We asked why such a rush and she acted as if it was our first time flying. Then we get to the gate mind you with plenty of time. We ended waiting to board an additional 45 minutes. Flight was supposed to leave at 7.00 then didn't finish boarding until 7.45. The reason being is because their organization at the gate was awful. Once we get on the plane we had to ask folks to move out of our seats. Yep how is that possible with assigned seats (I guess not Spirit Airlines fault but it seems like the folks who fly Spirit are not the smartest). Sorry seems awful, but you no what it is the truth. You get what you pay for. Then the flight attendants had no idea how to be professional. And guess what all along the way you were charged for everything. Bags, water, seat assignments, etc. It wasn't that much cheaper than other reputable airlines. Oh! Forgot to mention one of the other passengers made a threat towards me. Not sure why, that is what you are working with on Spirit.",-1

2021-03-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Ft Lauderdale to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"You get what you pay for, but never again",False,"  First time ever writing a review, my advice is don’t book a ticket with this airline it was the worst experiences ever. Not only do they charge extra for drinks, snack, and carry on luggage they also have seats that don’t recline. No entertainment for guests such as a movie to compensate for the small leg space and uncomfortable flight. They were offering wifi on this last trip I took for a dollar charge. There was a lot of rude and low class passengers causing drama using fowl language and the flight attendants didn’t know how to keep the situation under control. There was a altercation between several passengers where one passengers assaulted another and they walked right out of the plane and exited the airport, since there were no authorities called. I did not feel safe, mind you I was traveling with children. You get what you pay for, but never again am I booking a flight with this airline again.",-1

Plane was delayed almost 2 hours. They didn't even offer complimentary drinks on the plane or snacks! Everyone in the plane were furious, we were at the airport by 9:30am knowing the plane leaves at 12.40pm, plane didn't leave until 2 or 3 pm, hundreds of people were upset and mad! First time and last time I use this careless customer service company! When we finally get to our gate at this point we haven't had breakfast and of course no time to get lunch, the hostess at the gate wanted us to come on in and I said we waited almost 4 hours for you, we need 10 seconds to go to the restroom. Then she had an attitude because we used the restroom as we told her we needed to use the restroom, and she continues with ignorance to check us in where to the point of ignoring questions that I had. We went passed her and ignore her at that point.",-1

And him telling me that we get a free carry-on was ridiculous, one carry-on is free anyway, he acted like he was giving us a good deal! He also pressured me into filling out a review for him.",-1
2021-03-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,This is horrible customer service,False,"  On March 18th, I called the Spirit Airline’s customer service number and was on hold for over an hour each time I called. I advised the representative that I was calling only to get prices on my tickets if moved to a later date/time due to the vehicle rental place being closed early in the morning when my flight was originally set for. (We had 3 tickets under the same reservation), she then proceeded to look up other flights options and provided me with information, I then advised that I would like to know what the total would be changing a fourth ticket on another reservation to our existing one, again only asking for pricing before making a final decision. She then changed the tickets without my permission or even giving me the 4th estimate I asked for. At that moment the call was disconnected. Later on at night I checked our tickets since we had to leave early the next morning and find out that our tickets had been moved to the following date and too late at night. I then immediately called the airline’s customer service number, to again wait for hours, then someone answered and hung up, then called again, and waited for about another hour to get an answer. I spoke to the representative and he stated that unfortunately there was nothing he could do, I told him that I had not confirmed for my flights to be switched at all and that he needed to switch them back to the original flights date and time, he said the price had now gone up and it would cost me an additional $800-$900 extra dollars to get back my original reservation. I told him that was way out of budget, and unfair since I did not confirm any changes to begin with. He stated I could keep the new changes for an additional $300 and those were my options now, pay $300 more or $800-$900 to get my original tickets back. I then told him that calls should be recorded and to check my original conversation with the representative. He then stated it may be 5 days or more for the recording, and even then I may not get reimbursed, yet I had to fly out the next day. This is horrible customer service and this company wants to take as much money from you as possible. At the end I needed up having to pay an extra $300 for the 3 tickets they changed without my permission/confirmation. On March 20th I paid ahead for my carry-on using the Spirit app and received an e-mail confirmation from the company that they received the payment. When I went thru the Spirit Airline pre-security screening check, a woman from “Wilson Manors Florida,” (as it states on her name tag, although she was working this day at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport), she started yelling at me and accusing me of not paying for my carry-on after looking at my ticket which had not yet updated the information, she refused to look at the e-Mail confirmation I received, stating receipt. I then advised her that I would pay again if that was the case, and that there was no need for her unprofessional, disrespectful, public shaming behavior, I also advised her that I would be reporting her, because this is completely unacceptable. She then continued to keep us there. My family and I witnessed how she kept letting many people in without her looking at their tickets at all, and letting them in with many carry-on and bags, again, not taking a look at their tickets to confirm they paid for their check-in suitcases. She then started yelling at my mother for her small case.",-1
2021-03-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Tampa,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3.0,denied my child the right to check in,True,"  Today 3/21/21 at 5:45am the customer service agents at the Philadelphia, PA airport denied my child the right to check in for her 7am flight to Tampa, FL. This is now the second event where the Philadelphia Spirit staff have not allowed her on a paid flight. As her mother I pay the additional fee for her as an unaccompanied minor. The Tampa Spirit customer service representatives are nothing short of amazing. They make every check in painless, yet her last two returning flights from Philadelphia, PA have been a nightmare. How is it the Philadelphia Spirit Staff can make their own rules and deny my child the right to get home? 7am flight, gates close at 6:30am. She was standing in line at 5:30, at the counter for 5:45am and denied the right to obtain a boarding pass !?! That is unacceptable. Let’s keep in mind she had no luggage to be checked. The paperwork that Tampa completes takes less than 10 mins and again we have never had an issue. Yet, Philadelphia spirit is not capable of completing it. Let’s also mention there was another minor that was denied the right to board and they were there at 5am. In January, Spirit left my unaccompanied minor at the Philadelphia airport. The flight had been delayed 3x and she went to get food. In the mean time they decided to leave early than the last delayed announcement and she was stuck to get a flight from Frontier after 6 hours in the airport. I am still waiting for Corporate to address that as well and it’s March .",-1
2021-03-20,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,This was a terrific flight,False,"  This was a terrific flight. From the checkin to bag drop off to the flight. My first time on spirit. I was nervous and had some reservations but glad we took a chance. No frills but didn’t expect that. Great flight, great employees and I’d do it again !",1
2021-03-19,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Orlando,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,1.0,never be flying Spirit again,True,"  I will never be flying Spirit again. Firstly, most other heavy bag qualifications start at 50 pounds, Spirit starts at 40 pounds. So the bag already goes from 52 to 82 dollars for something that would only cost 35 with most other airlines. Then I was charged an additional 57 dollars for having a skateboard which fits under the seat anyway. No one should be charging a full carryon price for something that doesn’t require space like luggage. Again, no other airlines have charged me for having a skateboard before.  There is no social distancing whatsoever and there is already less room on this plane. My knees barely fit behind the seat comfortably and I’m only 5’7.",-1
2021-03-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,This was the last time I let Spirit rip me off,True," 
You may think you're saving money by flying with Spirit, and you may think that by bringing a small backpack you will save even more rather than paying their exorbitantly overpriced baggage fees, but it's entirely up to the gate agent to decide whether or not they want to charge you $65 as you're boarding your flight. This happened to me and many others that were in line to have our tickets scanned as we were boarding. This agent just pulled all of us out of line, and even though most bags fit within their 'guideline' box, she still had us all line up at the counter and without telling us what was happening, each one of us had to give our credit cards to pay so we could board the flight. I do not believe it is acceptable to fluster and scare your customers into thinking that they will miss their flight if they don’t immediately comply with a demand to pay as they are boarding their flight. Customer service experience was even worse as they seem to continuously provide you with the same generic template that claims ""I’m afraid I'm unable to verify what bag you had at the time of travel and its dimensions"" so they will take the agent's word over yours even if you provide photos. I will definitely be spending a little more on my flights to avoid flying with Spirit in the future. I wasted countless hours trying to get a hold of someone in 'guest relations' that could help me but no one would. This was the last time I let Spirit rip me off and treat me so poorly. I've changed my plans around countless times when they unexpectedly change flights on your both before and during your trip. I've endured sitting in those tiny seats with the tinier trays crammed in with countless other passengers who barely even fit within the confines of their tiny allotted bits of space. The rules seem to change based on where you are and what the gate agents decide so unless you have absolutely no other options, I would avoid flying with this airline at all costs.",-1
2021-03-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Baltimore,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,unsettling and frankly just rude,True,  I came on to my flight and had on a kn95 mask and the flight attendant told me I had to change and followed me to my seat and harassed me to change my mask for theirs. It was very unsettling and frankly just rude. My mask completely covered my nose and mouth so I should not have even had to change it out to begin with but the approach is what annoyed me!,-1

We cooperated had our masks on correctly and they didn't like our masks so they gave us different one. We put them on and I had mine on inside out on accidently and this lady told me she was gonna kick me off if I didn't obey her. I apologized and she told me next time off off the plane I will go and talked to me and my mother like trash. She did this to several other ppl on the plane and we were all very apologetic but she just keep threatening everyone to be thrown off. I am sitting on plane I can't read her name tag.

I was given 2 $50 vouchers due to my flights being canceled that are virtually unusable! First they must be booked within 60 days during a pandemic! Next I spent time finding flights then couldn’t use them. I call and am told they aren’t for that class of flight. I ask how I’d know that and am told there is no way I would. Then I get a manager who says he would help and his help was charging us $119 to use the vouchers when we would pay $122 without. Talk about a joke! Complete lies and deception to get angry customers to shut up without actually giving them anything. Even the agents agreed it was unreasonable.,-1

Our luggage was measured and it was perfect but the employees at Spirit charged us extra because they “thought” it was larger. We tried to call them later and complain about it but they did not care at all.  Even if the flights are cheaper, do not take this airline or else you will be paying even more with the addition of each luggage bag (even if it is much smaller than their limit).",-1

Their cheap rates, their fancy app, their budget-friendly accommodations. Don’t fall for them. They find a way to screw you over even if you read the fine print. I carefully measured all our backpacks, making sure they fit within the 8x14x18 parameters. When the bags measured too fat, I made my 3 children take out their extra clothes and toys so it would be smaller. There! We did it! We waited in line to board when the Spirit Airlines associate walked up and down the line of people waiting to board. I saw people tensing up but didn’t understand why. I was confused until he stopped at our family and asked the dreaded question, “May I see your boarding pass?” And there goes $56 because one bag’s wheels stuck out by an inch. The wheel. Geez, give parents a 1” wheel break. Pretty sure there’s a rule in their handbook that says “look for the stressed parents with several small children, they’ll be the easiest target with extra fees.” Spirit, I’ll think again next time before choosing your airline.",-1

They cancel your flight last minute and when I call to ask why they said it was not. Just a mistake and will correct it. I made another phone call a day later and they said it was cancelled! They changed my flight for another day with no confirmation from me. Stay away for your own good. Customer service put you on hold for ever and have no answers for you. Still waiting on my refund.,-1
2021-03-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,This left me and my baby stranded in the airport,False,"  I have flown Spirit a handful of times, never understanding why reviews were horrible. Today Spirit showed its true colors, by downgrading the size of plane-putting 30 passengers out of a flight. I had no warning, until I went to check my bags and was informed me and my infant, along with 30 other people who no longer could board the flight. They only offered to be able to fly me out in a day or 2, with no guarantee that those planes wouldn't be overbooked. I had to be back the next morning, no later. The manager in Tampa was saying ""suck it up"" and deal with it. This left me and my baby stranded in the airport. Their hotel and meal vouchers are a joke, they barely cover anything, and getting a refund will never happen. I rushed to the Delta counter, spending last minute prices, for a flight home. I made it home at a costly price. Save yourself the panic and problems and just book with an airline who cares about their passengers. I will never fly on another Spirit Airlines.",-1
2021-03-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Houston via San Pedro Sula Honduras,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,No one is doing anything,False,"  I am not getting any assistance on calling over a month with Spirit. No one is doing anything. I get transferred, hung up on, sent to cancelation departments. I get over hour long hold times etc. We booked a trip to Cancun on first of February. I purchased insurance to protect my flight. We canceled that reservation and the insurance I purchased was nearly impossible to do. After talking to Spirit the only thing they could do was get a credit. We felt like if that’s our only options then to take that. We didn’t want that but since it was our only option accepted that. We did and booked a different vacation to Honduras from Las Vegas with a connection through Houston. It was supposed to be the redeye. We purchased rental cars hotels, ferry trips etc and Spirit changed our flight from Friday to Thursday. We now have to fly from Las Vegas to Detroit, Detroit to Fort Lauderdale, to Honduras on Thursday. So now we not only have to cancel our previous hotels, rental cars and already paid expenses we have to change and pay for new hotel, rental cars, and take 3 kids ages 7, 2 and 6 months an extra day, and 8 more hours of flight time. Not only that I would be forced to take an extra day off work. Since Spirit changed the dates of travel we are wanting a fill refund, paid back for lost cancelations to rental cars and hotels and also our hours on phone. We are being advised they can only return the money on the card that was used on the 2nd reservation and only return our credit on the flight. This is unacceptable since it’s Spirits fault again on changing times and we are never flying Spirit again. Why would we take a risk again if rental car and hotels when they are subject to change flight times. This is the 2nd time I’ve emailed this company but no one responds. When I talk to customer service they transfer me over to vacation package, then they hang up on me and then they do nothing for me.",-1

Whole crew were safe and courteous during our trip. Masks were worn the whole trip unless you were eating or drinking and flight attendants were vigilant in reminding people to keep their masks on.

The airline refused to honor our COVID test claiming requirements not noted by the CDC nor the Honduras embassy. As proof that they were lying to us, we had another team member flying a different airline from a different airport with the same test form as my team had and she was never stopped or questioned. I am convinced that Spirit was hoping that we would simply not fly and they don't issue refunds, so they are out to rob people when they can. My co-worker arrived on time. We arrived a day late, with no compensation for our time or aggravation. They refused to discuss the issue with me both in person at the airport and over the phone, forcing me to text with someone. They promised a phone call from their cooperate office, they never called. They nickel and dimed the baggage to death to the point that it ended up costing as much to fly with them as it would have cost to fly a name brand airline. I will never fly with them again.",-1

I fly frequently but this was the first time with Spirit and I did not know how horrible they were. A few weeks after booking, they EMAILED me to notify me that they had added a 10 hour layover to the flight. A layover through the night in the FLL airport. They did nothing to apologize about this change or work with me to compensate me for this major inconvenience. Finding a way to call Spirit about this was almost impossible as their wait time for calls surpassed three hours. I tried their text line to address the issue and the wait time with that is just as bad. They do not care to assist their customers whatsoever. When they did reply to my inquiry I was told that “Changes happen” and that there was nothing they were willing to do besides refund the flight. During the return flight, our bag was not put on our plane back to Denver. They did not connect our bag or even notify us that this was the case. Contacting them to find out where our bag was, was anything but smooth. Another three hour wait to get a text message referring us to a website. No real human help with an issue THEY caused. Then, we were told that our bag was on a flight to Denver that would arrive at 9:25 Denver time. It arrived at 11:25 Denver time, a two hour wait due to the incompetence of Spirit yet again. Their customer service is nonexistent. I will not be flying with them again.",-1
2021-03-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit lied to me and they did not honor their promises,False,"  Spirit Airlines decided to bump me up to another flight without explanation. I called them to make sure I was to receive a voucher for the 12 hours overlay versus 4 hours in my original reservation. I was guaranteed one voucher by a Spirit agent that I was to receive a hotel voucher. Guess what, when time to claim my voucher arrives nobody was home. I accepted the new itinerary based on the voucher. Spirit lied to me and they did not honor their promises. Now I have to buy 2 extra nights at hotels because Spirit decided to bump me up without any considerations to the impact or satisfaction of their customer. I could have bought a American Airlines ticket with the two extra night. Horrible customer services. I hope they go bankrupt. Stay away from those liars.",-1
2021-02-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Nashville to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst mistake of my life,True," This is the absolute worst airline operating in the world today! I have taken no less than 5 flights per year for the past 15 years and this was my first and last time ever making the mistake of flying with Spirit Airlines again! I should have known when I saw that it is now 2021 and they have no WiFi available that it was going to be a bad experience but I went ahead and paid for first class best seats on the plane thinking that should make it a comfortable flight, worst mistake of my life! This is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review but if it helps someone not make the same mistake I made by flying with this airline then it will be worth my time. So as I mentioned no WiFi, no TV’s, no nothing! Even in first class! But ok so it’s cheap not a long flight you might say I can handle that but that was nothing compared to the service from the flight crew. They were unlike anything I have ever seen. If you pulled your mask down to take a sip of water they would yell at you in front of everybody like a school kid. I had my mask on the entire flight but someone beside me was eating a candy bar and the flight attendant told him to take a bite and chew with his mask on but she didn’t politely tell or ask him to do so she screamed at him in front of all the other passengers and he was humiliated. As I mentioned earlier I was in first class and when they started beverage service I ask for a drink and was told that because my phone had vibrated while we were taxing to the runway (before take off) that I wouldn’t be allowed any drink services. I could not believe what she said, I thought it was a joke and kind of smiled and said ok but she was dead serious. I could go on and on but the bottom line is that if you want to be treated like a child and be on a plane that is dirty, old and with no modern technology then Spirit Airlines is the only airline I’ve ever seen that will allow the flight attendants to treat customers the way they do and allow the plane to not be cleaned after each flight. There were crumbs all in my seat and on the floor, it was truly unbelievable and here’s the best part, the person that was with me on the flight wrote a review talking about how bad Spirit Airlines really is and Spirit sent her an email saying she was on the airlines no fly list because she spoke negatively about them. Well I’ll be waiting on my email for writing this but honestly I would never take another flight on Spirit if it was free for the rest of my life. I hope this review saves someone from the nightmare of this airline, everyone on the plane at baggage claim was talking about how they would never fly with them again so I can’t imagine them staying in the air much longer and that would be better for everyone fooled by their cheap flights. Don’t do it, the extra money is worth it I promise.",-1
2021-02-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Pedro via Houston,,,,,,,1.0,They now changed our flight day again,True,"  We were traveling with 3 children ages 7,2,and 6 months and anyone who travels with children know you make plans around their age. We booked a flight to Cancun and Spirit changed our dates of our flight plans. We felt now we were in a huge bind because changes to flight plans we had to adapt to change our hotels, rental cars, prepaid plans etc. We would have to pay a ton more money to make the changes and the cheapest method was to pay the cancelation policies to our resorts, rental cars, and online shows we already purchased to Cancun. It cost us a ton to cancel. The frustrating thing is we decided to take an airline credit because fighting with them over reimbursed flight money made it unbearable. We decide to use our airline credit on A Friday head to San Pedro Sula and arrive on a Friday direct from Vegas through Houston. We wanted to ferry to Roatan and enjoy our vacation in the Caribbean. We booked our hotels, paid for our Ferry ride and rental cars etc according to the flight and when we were arriving. They now changed our flight Day again from Friday to Thursday to DTW, then fly another leg to FLL then arrive to SPS. We would have to not only change all our hotels, rental cars, prepaid ferry rides but we are now having to take young children an extra legs, take an extra day off work, and haul them around for 3 days through airports and hotels before we even get to our Destination.",-1

2021-02-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,3.0,They refused to give us a refund,False,"  We got theses tickets back in February. Unfortunately due to covid eveything shutdown and a mandatory stay at home order went into place. We were supposed to fly the week that covid hit. We contacted the airline and let them know we were not flying. On top of that no word about our original flight being cancelled. I called and spoke with a CSR wanted a refund, but the CSR that I talked said they couldn't give me a refund and could only extend my credit to 3/12/2021. Fast forward to 2/1/2021. Covid is still around even with the vaccine being done it's still taking time and we don't feel safe flying. I contacted them again about the same issue. They refused to give us a refund. All they have done is extend our credit to the end of this year and offer a stupid $50 voucher for the inconvenience. What a joke. It's been one big nightmare dealing with the company. Safe to say we will not be flying with them again. Here is what the agent said to me. We understand your need to postpone travel due to the current effects of COVID-19. We greatly value your business and the opportunity to serve your travel needs. All Spirit fares and optional services are purchased as non-refundable; however, a refund will be allowed if a reservation is cancelled within 24 hours of initial booking, provided the reservation was made seven (7) days or more prior to the flight’s scheduled departure. We regret that your reservation is non refundable. This decision is not based on lack of compassion. Consistency in the enforcement of our guidelines is the only way to be fair to all our valued Guests. I'm sorry that you're dissatisfied with our response. All our Guests are equally important; if we make an exception for you, we will have to do it for everybody else. Our position remains unchanged. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but there is nothing else I can do regarding this issue. As an added incentive I’d be happy to offer you an additional $50 voucher on top of your reservation credit, which will also be valid for 12 months. Like the reservation credit, the voucher can be used to pay for your fare, taxes, fees, bags and seats. If you would like to accept the additional $50 voucher, please reply acknowledging acceptance and I will provide you with the voucher details. We look forward to serving you on your next flight. Best, Guest Relations",-1

2021-02-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to New Orleans,,,,,,,1.0,could not refund us after 30 minutes,True,"  I’m attaching the photo of their website where is says “Book with Confidence! No change or cancelation fees!” They are lying! I bought tickets for my whole family out of a rush in order to get home because our other flight was canceled. 30 minutes later I went to cancel the flight because our other airline found us flights and they said “no cancelations fees but we are still charging you for all your flights” 1. How could you not refund us after 30 minutes. 2. The definition of no cancelations fees is when you cancel before the deadline, you will be refunded. If you have a cancellation fee, that fee will be taken from the sum paid and you will be refunded the rest. What, you would have charged me twice for not coming on the flight? That would make no sense.",-1

I had called multiple numbers for 3 days and each call I was on hold for over an hour. I also sent over 5 emails and used their what's app customer service agent line and no answer. Finally on the fourth day, after being on hold for 30 minutes, I had a real life person speaking to me but then to only tell me they do not refunds on carry-ons or flights. But if the phone would've been answered the first day I called I would've gotten a refund since it was 24 hours in booking the flight. So because they never picked up the phone, I can't get a refund (which is already ridiculous that you have to pay for a carry on and its $40 for each). Horrible customer service and I will not be booking with Spirit again no matter how cheap the flights are.",-1

I ordered and paid for what Spirit calls “big front seats” but the agent collected the fee and gave me standard seating.

I contacted them 36 hours after the flight.",-1

I only have myself to blame because 'you absolutely will have the flight that you pay for'. We purchased 2 tickets on the Spirit website, the cost was supposed to be 157 dollars round trip. 1 free back pack, with 38 dollars for a carry on bag included. But at check out you also have to buy your seat for an additional $15 per person. We did not buy the additional seat, that left us at the mercy of the crew (very rude) for seating arrangements. It’s the way they entice you to sign up for their credit card for a $100 discount on the flight cost if the application is approved. That cannot be further from the truth. They never told you at first you’ll get a 'voucher credit' only & only if you spend 1k in flight within 90 days. They also do not tell you the card have an annual fee of $80 /year. This is so misleading, it defies logic and I feel awful to have fallen for their stupid trap. The day of the flight each way were overbook gate and flight changes with no advance notice and the 38 dollars carry on bag was only for one way. For the return flight the same bag now was an additional 48 dollars. When we add the headache, the time wasted, and frustration there is not a cent saved. If we had booked Southwest for 300 dollars it would been the exact same price for less drama. Needless to say I cancelled the credit card, and moving forward I’ll be make sure that even if they were the last flight on earth I will never fly with them. On top of it all we were on a overbooked flight, pack like sardines with no leg room especially if you are 6ft tall. That was a complete nightmare and their unprofessionalism defies all logic. Buyer beware.",-1

We were scheduled to fly out a certain day back to our destination (home) when they cancelled our flight until two days later. Upon speaking to Spirit they were no help. We have no family in Nevada and what started off as a relaxing getaway quickly turned into a disaster. Due to us not being prepared we had no options and they could no assist us with any help. After giving them hell they gave us a discounted room but upon calling them there was no discount, after taxes we were looking at almost $300 for a room at the La Quinta 'no way' then was told we could not stay in the airport (Mccaren Airport Las Vegas) but a list of shelters will be provided to us.

I got to the boarding gate, I was told that I cannot board with my personal item (very small bag), that I have to pay for that separately. They threatened to close the gate on me if I do not go ahead to pay an extra $65 for hand luggage. Meanwhile, my ticket which I purchased from Priceline, clearly noted that personal items are covered in the ticket, while checked-in back costs $55. I had no choice but to pay.

The communication is super slow. Calling an agent is a headache because you have to waste literally 2-3 hours. Lazy reminders on flight dates. Rude staff, worst customer service. They charge you extra for literally everything and you end up paying as much for it as any other high rated airlines. It's so not worth it, you will at least be treated better in other airlines for the same amount of money that you pay. Time is also money and if you add your time wasted and the services you don't get, plus the frustrations, the low cost turns to be more expensive in many ways.",-1

2021-02-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Ft Myers,1.0,,3.0,,,2.0,2.0,cancelling all flights into Ft. Myers,False,"  I'm fine with the limited legroom, uncomfortable seats and bare bones flying experience Spirit offers. What's not acceptable is Spirit cancelling all flights into Ft. Myers for the week booked, including our flights and not even bothering to email me. After 20+ minutes on hold I finally spoke with an rep who advised that my payment would be credited to future travel. I have no desire to ever book with Spirit again and had to fight to get my money back. There were eight of us traveling and now we need to make alternative travel plans and Spirit wasted 3 days. I happened upon the cancellation while checking flights for that week, otherwise, I may not have known until we arrived at the airport. I asked if they would fly us into FLL - 2hrs away - at the same price since there were similar flights (day/time). Even though it was an extra 2 hrs of driving and we'd have to now eat the cost of a rental car, Spirit refused to make the switch without charging the extra $30/person. THEY cancelled our flights. I had another flight booked for March to FLL and actually received an email from Spirit that they cancelled my nonstop early morning flight and switched me to a flight with an 8 hr layover, effectively killing my entire day. Unacceptable. When buying bare bones airfare, you shouldn't be surprised with seats that are as comfortable as a wooden park bench, but you should be able to count on the airline meeting their end of the agreement and providing the flight, and at the very least sending an email to let you know they cancelled the flights. Book anywhere else if you want to be somewhere specific on a specific date. You cannot count on Spirit to not cancel your flight.",-1

They fleeced me with charging me $217 for my luggage. They let me through the checkin to get to the gate to charge me a premium for carry-on over check-in.  The customer service was terrible as if they took pride in being terrible and rude - it’s the only thing they are good at. I would not recommend traveling with them. I would have saved money flying American for what they charged us for our luggage. Save yourself the frustration and choose anyone else.,-1
2021-02-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,What happened to social distancing?,False,"  Today on January 31, 2020, my family and I were supposed to take a Spirit Flight from Michigan to New York. During the boarding process, the flight attendant asked us to put a mask on our two year old daughter. However, our daughter is unable to wear a mask due to her low grade autism disorder and other medical conditions. They told us if she cannot wear a mask, they will have to cancel this flight and put us on a different flight. We didn’t agree with that logic because it didn’t make sense to us. Why would she magically decide to wear a mask on the next flight if she can't wear a mask on this one? We asked them if she can use a pacifier in place of a mask but they refused. We tried to put a mask on our baby but she was crying and rolling on the floor covering her mouth and screaming no mask mommy, no mask. Everyone on the flight watched the drama unfold and the flight crew did nothing but scoff at the idea that a 2 year old can't wear a mask! The flight attendant displayed disgusting behavior. They subsequently let a 4 year old go inside the flight without a mask. If they honestly cared about public safety, why are they completely packing all of their flights? ALL other airlines close the middle row in between passengers but Spirit packs everyone in their planes like sardines and then expects everyone to be safe? What happened to social distancing? If they cared so much about my daughter wearing a mask they should ban all travel for children who cannot wear masks, including infants! They can exhale contaminated air just like adults, no? This airline, their mask policy, their employees and their cramped airplanes and all TRASH. This goes without saying but I will never take this Spirit again.",-1

The customer service is horrible, they nag and stalk you. If you are looking to have calm, easy, no stress trip do not, I mean do not fly Spirit. You have to pay for everything from water to bags, nothing like United and Jetblue. If you want have a nice normal flight spend the extra few dollars to fly with a good airline. I will never get on another plane that is Spirit affiliated. There is also no wifi on the planes and the seats are like sitting on cardboard mixed with cement, I couldn’t really decide between the two.

Unfortunately time was of the essence and Spirit was the only reasonably priced flight I could find that was non stop. To my surprise my flight was actually good. I had a nice flight attendant named Raymond that was very accommodating and when he heard that my mom and I were leaving Vegas due to my grandmother passing away he offered his condolences and paid for us to get a snack. The flight was smooth and we left a little early and arrived in Baltimore early. The only thing I would fix is spirit not having updated seats that recline and a tv attached that you could watch. Spirit charges for everything why not put in new seats and charge a small fee for people to have access to tv.,1
2021-01-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2.0,refused to wear their masks,True,"  My husband and I flew on Spirit Airlines on Sunday, January 10, 2021. There were 3 passengers seated across from me and up one row who refused to wear their masks despite being asked multiple times by flight attendants. The flight attendants just kept bringing alcohol to them even though they were already drunk & and being loud and unruly. I assume this is because Spirit wanted to make more money from these passengers. This behavior endangered the entire plane which was sold out and full. Several other passengers pointed out the no mask wearing and loud behavior by these 3 passengers but were given lip service and told that they could not do anything about these passengers not wearing their masks. When I got home, I tried to call Spirit Airlines to complain and ask them to follow their own policies moving forward but I couldn't actually get anyone on the phone. So I sent a detailed email regarding the situation, and got a return email stating that Spirit would reply to me in 30-60 days. Any other airline would have diverted the plane or had passengers removed from the plane by law enforcement upon reaching the destination. There were no consequences for the 3 passengers on our plane. To top it all off, I rec'd an email from Spirit a couple days ago stating that they were following strict mask policies. Not true. Again, I hope we and the entire full plane don't get Covid-19.",-1

I just flew 5 legs with Spirit and every flight the middle seats were filled, and not with people from the same party. I felt so vulnerable to COVID in their planes. Two flights announced completely filled flights. Plus one of my flights was cancelled and I was put on a flight 36 hours later. My connecting flight in LAS scheduled for Monday 10:20pm was cancelled and replaced by a flight Wednesday 11:00am. Spirit would not provide a Hotel or Taxi even when they failed to have an aircraft for my flight. This is the first time I was stranded overnight and the responsible airline would not provide any compensation, hotel or taxi. My replacement flight was scheduled to arrive in BWI at 11:00pm Wednesday, when my return flight was scheduled for 7:00am Thursday, eight hours later. Not even enough time for me to leave the airport. I had over $500 additional out of pocket costs because of Spirit’s issue. I had to pay 2 nights stay at a Las Vegas hotel because my connecting flight was cancelled and my layover now became 36 hours. Because I did not arrive into BWI at my scheduled time and date, I incurred a rental car and hotel penalty for a No Show. Spirit declined to help with any of my incurred costs. My trip cost was more than double as a result of Spirit cancelling my connecting flight. I also had to rebook Last-Minute hotel and rental car reservations at peak prices when I finally arrived at my final destination.",-1

They offered no compensation for hotel, transportation back to the correct airport, only a voucher. Even more they told me I would have to file a complaint online. The same complaint form they themselves were responding to because there is no other way they could have contacted me. Like I would take another chance of then abandoning me in another country again.",-1

2021-01-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Raleigh to Fort Lauderdale via Austin,,,,,,1.0,1.0, Never again Spirit Airlines,True,"  This was my first experience with Spirit Airlines. I had heard horror stories previously of Spirit and had consistently avoided them until today when it was what was available. My flight was purchased Jan 2 2021 for Jan 3 2021 at 1200. I arrived at the airport roughly an hour early, waited in line for 15 minutes at the self help kiosk to be told that I needed an attendant to assist me. The attendant then explained that I was too late to check in for my flight, this time frame had expired while waiting. I asked what my options were and was told that I would have to pay a $99 rebooking fee. I agreed as I needed to be in Austin for Business. Cue attendant's kiosk crashing (why we were waiting in the first place). Attendant calls Spirit I.T. (red flags galore). It's a woman in pajamas sitting a her kitchen table with kids...what? Kiosk comes back online, the conversation sounded frustrated and personal, but not technical (again...what?). The other 3 passengers behind me are experiencing the same error and watching these events unfold. One walks up next to me and asks attendant whats going on. She stops helping me, then checks his ticket, only to tell him that he is not going to be flying today as well. She turns her back on him to face me and explains the next flight is the next day. Fine. There is an overnight layover. Ok. They are not going to cover it or a hotel stay. Nope. Attendant then realizes that I'm not flying to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, I'm flying to Austin, Texas. Oh. There are no flights for 3 days on Jan 06. I explain that I can not travel then as my business in Austin is on the 5th and will have to contact my boss to explain situation. Spirit Attendant tells me to ""hurry up"" as they are closing down in 10 minutes(with more passengers in the same situation as me, at 1200, the same time as my original flight). At this point I did what I should have done the day prior, walked away without another word, and bought a ticket for slightly more money from American Airlines. It may have cost a few extra bucks, but as least I know that American pays their electricity bill and knows how to both fuel an airplane and land one. Never again Spirit Airlines, never again.",-1
2021-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Chicago,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Thank goodness for the Southwest website,False,  Spirit cancelled the flight on New Year’s Day evening for the flight the next day. One and a half hours of hold time waiting for their “customer service” and then they could not get me on another flight for three days. Thank goodness for the Southwest website though the flight was much higher priced due to the short notice and of course Spirit won’t cover the higher cost. Long story short horrible policies and horrible customer service only fly them if you can afford to be stranded at your destination.,-1
2021-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Charlotte,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,the safety of their passengers means nothing to them,True," There were no efforts to social distance people on the plane. A lot of airlines have a capacity limit and leave the middle seat free to ensure passenger safety during Covid times. Instead, Spirit Airlines could not have communicated with more clarity that the safety of their passengers means nothing to them. Both our personal items fit the Spirit dimensions when we measured them at home, and we had no issue fitting them under our seat on the way to Florida. On the way back, they made us and almost every other passenger fit it in their bag thing and when it wouldn’t go all the way down without effort, they charged us $55 per bag. Even though our bags fit under the seat, and fit the measurements. It was just that when we packed them, there was a little bulge. We did not expect them to be this particular, I’ve never had this experience with any other airline. Plus, they were very rude about it. Overall, not worth the low price, avoid Spirit if you can!",-1

Then when we got to Vegas they kept everything at 25% capacity. I was hopeful since we did this in a pandemic and was excited to see everything and everywhere was doing social distancing and masks. Then the plane ride home we were in a packed plane with not one seat available, no hand sanitizer provided, no snack on our 6 hour flight, it was horrible. The result four days after my flight I came down with covid symptoms and tested positive for the virus. Very upsetting this could of been prevented.",-1

Spirit at this time is refusing to extend their flight credits past May 31st, 2021. Due to the pandemic every other airline has extended their flight credits except spirit.

2020-12-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,the agent would not check us in,False,"  We were one minute late arriving at the ticket counter and the agent would not check us in. As we were begging to be checked in she interrupted us to say ""now you are 2 minutes late"". She said sure we could talk to a supervisor but she's out at the gate and we couldn't talk to her until after the flight had left. And we couldn't go to the gate to talk to her because we didn't have a boarding pass.  When I got upset, understandably so, she threatened to call the airport police on me. I called spirit airlines and received no help at all from them. In my frustration I swore and hung up the phone. A minute later my phone rang. It was spirit airlines. I thought I'd get some help. The agent had taken the time to call me back to tell me I should feel shame for cursing at him. And no, he couldn't help me. Me and my friend were booked on the same flight the next day. Which was not an option for us. We went across the aisle to the delta airlines counter.  She found us a flight out 2 hours later, checked our bags for free and was nice and extremely helpful. The lack of compassion, the absolute refusal to help us get on the flight we had tickets for, the rudeness of both ticket agents was unlike anything I have ever experienced in all my years of flying.",-1
2020-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas to Philadelphia,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Terrible company, terrible customer service",True," Terrible company, terrible customer service. So I decided to book a trip with them for family gathering for my wife and my 3 kids, here are the issues I faced: 1) They canceled the direct flight I got so instead of 3 hours had to travel 7, which is a huge difference when you travel with kids. 2) On my way back they delayed my flight so when I went to the airport they informed me that I will miss the connection and the next availability for flight is in 3 days. 3) The travel agent told me that they will transfer me on AA flight but the manager came and said - No. 4) So I ended up paying for 5 last minute tickets with AA which cost me big time. 5) The Spirit agent told me that they will refund me the ticket after I get another ticket, so I got AA tickets and got back for the refund - the manager came again and say - No, no refund for you - call customer service. 6) Tried to call Customer Service, and waited 40 minutes but no one picked up. Flying Spirit is like a Russian roulette - few times you save but 1 out of 5 they will cancel or move your flight and you will end up paying big for last minute ticket. So the net effect is negative - so my advice to you, never flight Spirit with kids or if you can't afford delay of 1-3 days.",-1

2020-12-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Kansas City to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,most incompetent airline I have ever flown,True,"  This airline has no functional online service. You cant change or cancel a flight. They provide no verification of canceling then they do not cancel the ticket. It took 7 times thru customer service to get a pattern response. It took 2 hours on line to get a customer service agent (in name only). 2 tickets booked, 2 canceled, no credit received or verification. This is the most incompetent airline I have ever flown.",-1
2020-12-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,This airline is a scam,True," This airline is a scam. They charged me at the gate for a small computer bag more money than the total cost of the ticket. The advertised price of the carry-on is less than half the charges they forced me to pay before they let me board. My bag would clearly fit in the demo display. It fit well under the seat and on my lap. On the flight there were many empty overhead bins. I used the sane size bags without charges on many other flight including Spirit Airlines on the sane and similar routes Florida to Texas. The airline counter agent was very rude and she treated me like a criminal. She was nasty and she bullied me, she insulted me in front of my family and friends. It was a bad experience, a real money extortion. An airline that allows such poor behaviour on any of its frequent flyers can only be a Scam Airline.",-1
2020-11-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,George Bush to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is a money gimmick overhaul,True," I am highly disappointed and dissatisfied with Spirit Airlines. I purchased a ticket for my sister, who had confirmed her ticket 2.5 hrs before her flight, that left at 6.45am, yet, they closed their doors an hr beforehand. They would not let her board, had to purchase a new ticket, customer service acted like they were in the “okay,” simultaneously acting upon the motive that they had the audacity to treat her like the janitors closet. Spirit Airlines is not a 10/10 airline. They do not treat their customers with great rapport, neither do they try to seek understanding from the party they’re working with. All in all, Spirit is a money gimmick overhaul (this is how I personally feel).",-1

I have a trip coming up that I paid for. The trip Is for my husband, myself and my sister. My sister can’t make it on the trip that I paid for so my daughter was going to go in her place since I paid for the trip. They tell me that I would have to cancel my whole trip and book over but the credit will be for the people booked on the trip so I can’t use it for my daughter because it Belongs to my sister that can’t make the trip. Meanwhile this is my first time flying. First time ever using this company. 1800 number doesn’t help. E mail doesn’t help (they said it would be up to 30 days before even contacting back). I absolutely hate Spirit already.",-1
2020-11-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,,,,,,,2.0,incompetent customer service,False,"  I never never dealt with more incompetent customer service reps who care less about the customer. We booked a flight going into Ohare, Illinois before the governor put all the restrictions in. I understand the cancellation policy, but this is very much an extenuating circumstance. Instead of trying to win my business, take care of me, or communicate in a charitable manner, the reps were extremely rude on the phone, kept talking over me, repeating themselves incessantly, and refused to give any real solution outside of a credit with severe limitations, AND that credit was not even the full amount of the fare? With Covid affecting how people operate, you would think Spirit would take notice and actually start refunding fares under circumstances where the state starts closing off travel, but when a company cares more about money than the customer, people lose. Stay away from this awful airline.",-1

I waited until 3pm and I didn’t hear from anyone so I started calling and then was told my bag is still in Atlanta and I had to pick it up there.

2020-11-02,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,it has been a complete headache using credits,False,"  I purchased three tickets through Spirit during spring break 2019, but due to the pandemic I was credited all of that money. Now in 2020, it has been a complete headache using those credits. Each time I’ve booked a flight something has happened. Our first flight booked to New Orleans was canceled last minute which required me to purchase a ticket out of pocket through a different airline to get there when we needed to get there. The second time I tried to use my flight credits to go to Florida, my nonstop (which I purchased intentionally because I’m traveling with kids) turned into a layover in Atlanta and changed our boarding times, going to Florida and coming back home, to ridiculously early boarding (again, not conducive for kids). Traveling with a family requires a lot of planning and Spirit is to unreliable. I will not be purchasing tickets through Spirit ever again.",-1
2020-10-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Baltimore,,,,,,,1.0,No one answers at customer service ever,False,"  So, my husband and I are traveling to Maryland at the beginning of December and wanted to try and make the most of our trip. I book on Monday and paid for our tickets. On Friday I received an email stating my flights had been ""updated""! So my flights went from a non stop, to a 1 stop 7 hour flight. My husband is in need of a helping hand and can not sit for long periods of time, so my flight is 2 hours and 2 minutes. Now it is a 7 hours ordeal and we have to change planes multiple times. No one answers at customer service ever, they say you can cancel the trip and rebook with your credit. So I cancel the flights and go on to look for new non-stops, well I'll be they are available, but now they are $500 per person instead of $190. There is nothing I hate more than deceptive business practices. PS, they will not issue any refunds only credit that you must use within 7 months.",-1
2020-10-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,crew members weren't very accommodating,False,"  Where do I start! So the airline loads us on flight NK567 when we encountered some really bad weather which caused the 4.26pm flight to be delayed. That wasn't even the worst part, while on board the crew members weren't very accommodating as passengers asked for water while they waited. Some passengers got really restless asking for alcohol and snacks. The crew members were very short and direct when telling them they simply couldn't and wouldn't. I have personally worked in customer service and I could've decreased tension in so many different ways, all this came after sitting on the plane for more than an hour. In my personal opinion when the crew couldn't answer any more questions or when they grew tired they told us they were taking us back to the terminal to refuel, after about 30-45 mins they returned us to the terminal and as tensions again got high they called the cops and security. As the crowd grew angry some personnel gave some answers, ""the pilot had maxed out all his time so we need another pilot, it isn't safe for anyone at this point"". I wouldn't write unless I felt there was another way. I've been in customer service for 20 plus years and I always try to look at situations and see how I could've done things differently. The ladies were upset and they got loud but I can't blame them because they asked questions and were just told to sit tight and here we are sitting in the airport at 10.03 pm, it's freezing and all the restaurants are closed. People have small children and nobody has offered anything to make things more comfortable for the moment.",-1
2020-10-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly on this airline again,True,"  I have never flown this airline before - nor will I ever again! We went to look at a university that I wanted to see and we booked a last minute flight - Spirit was one of the only nonstop flights still available and now I know why. This airline is obviously not aware that there is a pandemic at all. They took no precautions for the passengers or crew and piled us in every vacant seat they had. I flew Delta and united also in October and they both took great precautions including, taking temperatures, wiping the seats down, socially distanced passengers and had hand sanitizer everywhere. Spirit airlines was a sardine can. They did not take anyones temperature, nor did they wipe down seats or have sanitizer anywhere. Three people that I saw on the plane did not wear masks and that seemed fine with the airline. On the website they say they have implemented covid regulations but that is not true. They also have an erroneous number on their website (801) 401-2222, should you try to contact them it is out of order and apparently they do not know it and still list it. Do they have anyone the regulates their covid operations? We all live in Los Angeles which is a police state as far as the pandemic is concerned, yet they allow Spirit Airlines to have no restrictions at all. I wish the governor could see this flight I was on - he'd be disgusted and hopefully slap them with a fine. If I don't get Covid after taking this flight then I must have the best immunity system in the world. It is literally a petrie dish of infection and they don't seem to care. They need regulation so that they make it safe for their passengers during this pandemic. I don't think they are aware or care that there is a pandemic, they are just selling cheap flights. Also the flight is the worst ever - crammed in, no wifi, movies or any food but that is not what bothered me it was the lack of concern over covid.  I will never fly on this airline again.",-1
2020-10-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Santo Domingo,,,,,,1.0,1.0,airline is doing nothing to compensate me,True,"  As of now as I write this review, I have not actually gotten on my flight with Spirit Airlines. I booked a flight on Spirit for the first time to travel to the Dominican Republic. I have a service animal that needs approval, so I submitted my documents well ahead of the deadline for travel. I was told I would get a response within 2 business days. I did not hear from them until the third day, when they sent me an email to check in to my flight which listed my service animal. I was able to check in. In the afternoon I received an email saying they were looking for passengers to accept vouchers to change flights because they were over booked. Therefore, I should not be surprised when that night, after business hours, I received another email saying that they were denying my service animal because I didn't submit my documents, even though I had a confirmation email from the airline saying they had received the documents. I submitted them again. They didn't respond until after it was too late to get on my flight. My reservation was rescheduled three times, and it was another two and a half days before they finally approved my service animal. In addition, I now have to fly in to a city an hour and a half away from my actual destination, and the airline is doing nothing to compensate me for what they caused.",-1
2020-10-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Myers to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,They made our family feel unsafe,False,"  During our flight, there was a passenger that never wore a mask, not at any time on the flight. Repeatedly, the flight crew served this man 3 alcoholic beverages. They had ample opportunity to address the fact that he was not wearing a mask with him, and could have denied him the ability to purchase alcohol. Instead, they served him 3x. My issue is not with the serving of the alcohol, but rather that there was not a single person on the crew that stood up and made the man wear a mask, nor took any other measures about it. Passengers all around us were commenting on the fact that this passenger was not wearing a mask. No one felt safe. An older Air Force Veteran was seated directly in front of the passenger and asked that he put on a mask. The passenger said ""What's your problem? You believe all this bullshit?"" Furthermore, I witnessed the passenger go to the bathroom in the back of the plane 3x where the other flight crew was sitting in unoccupied seats. They didn't say a thing to him. They laughed with him when he passed as he took his long beard and covered his face (laughing) and they joined in the fun. Are you kidding me? You openly laugh with a passenger without a mask on and watch him go to the bathroom 3x and do absolutely nothing. We were travelling with my children, one of which is too young to wear a mask at only 16 months old. How is it okay, how is it safe for us to fly? They promised us as a company that their standard was to require masks to be worn. No exceptions. Yet they don't. After the flight, as we were disembarking, I said to one of the flight crew, ""How could you be so complicit as to let that man not wear a mask the entire flight?"" to which her response was ""He had one on and would take it off. What could I do about it?"". He did not have one on. Not at any point. Not when he went to the bathroom, not when he sat in his seat, not when he stood up before the plane was even done taxing (not once, not twice, but three times), nothing. How does your Flight Crew have NO answer to a passenger that won't put on a mask? Delta is openly banning passengers like this from ever flying again and, on record, has landed planes in flight to address people like this to show a firm hand, severe consequences. Spirit's team does nothing. They sit in the back of the plane and laugh with him. We will never fly Spirit again. They made our family feel unsafe. They made other passengers feel unsafe.",-1

They said they did not know how to accommodate us with him being over the age limit to sit in my lap but also if he got a ticket that it was a flight risk if he couldn’t sit on his own.

I called the customer service line to complain about the rip-off, supporting my claim with pictures, but the only answer I received was some nonsense explanation.

The family that was in the row in front of us should never be allowed to fly again. Not only did they on multiple occasions, break FAA regulations, they endangered the lives of everyone on that aircraft due to the lack of respect for CDC guidelines. They refused to wear their masks for the duration of the flight, disregarded direct orders from Spirit crew members about wearing face masks and staying in their seats on 6+ occasions, they were literally climbing over the seats, touching other passengers not in their party, and wore their seatbelt and were in their seat for a total of 30 minutes out of the entire 4 hour flight, despite orders from the captain and crew members to remain in their seats with their seatbelts fastened. The woman who was assigned to seat 10A also disregarded direct orders from Spirit employees by not wearing her face mask and encouraged the family in row 9 to disregard orders from Spirit crew members saying quote, “what are they going to do, throw us out of the plane?” When we finally landed, Spirit crew members did not execute social distancing disembarkation practices, so everyone was crowded around trying to get off the plane. Our flight out to San Diego a few days prior set a level of expectations for safe and comfortable flying during this pandemic, but this flight made my husband and I never want to fly on Spirit again due to the lack of concern for CDC guidelines and FAA regulations and ultimately, the safety of all of the passengers on that flight.",-1

Will never refer anyone to fly with Spirit Airlines they are a big mess. Bad business i need my money back.",-1
2020-08-19,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Orlando,5.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,A comfortable flight,True,  Houston to Orlando. The pilot kept us notified of expected bumpy weather which I did appreciate. A comfortable flight with a short duration of about two hours. Boarding was fast and swift. We did get a snack I think. I traveled with under the seat luggage. It was an early morning flight and airport was not busy.,1
2020-08-19,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,5.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,a nice short flight,True,  Have a nice short flight with Spirit Airlines from Orlando up to Newark New Jersey. The usual budget travel and I traveled with under the seat small bag. They had scanners for tickets which moved people along quickly. The pilot kept us informed of developments. He included warning about keeping the seat belt on since we might get some bumpy weather.,1
2020-08-18,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan PR to Fort Lauderdale,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,help customers like me,True,  For some reason I was unable to print my boarding pass with my TSA pre check and Yanel or Janel from Luis Muñoz Marin Airport in PR was so professional and help me with that just want to thank him for taking his time to help customers like me to get everything right on time.,1
2020-08-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Seattle via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,warn everyone to avoid this airline,False," Absolute worst. If I could give zero's across the board, I would. Overcharged for baggage, flight delayed several hours, changed from direct to a lay over. Staff was rude and unprofessional. The seat was so short it cut into the back of my thighs and my legs kept falling asleep. Stuck me in a middle seat and the man sitting next to me dumped his beer in my lap. Attendants couldn't be bothered to give me anything to clean up. It didn't help I was returning home from a family members funeral. The process for a 5 hour flight took over 12 hours. Never again and I warn everyone to avoid this airline, in fact avoid Delta, that's who I booked with, nowhere was Spirit Airlines mentioned, so I felt swindled. I couldn't post a review at the time of this flight which was Feb 2018.",-1
2020-08-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to New Jersey,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,No consistency at all,True,"  I have used the same suitcase for every flight but on a recent flight, I was made to pay. No consistency at all. I was also told that Spirit no longer accepts bandana masks and encourages to buy a regular mask in the gift shop next to the gate. Again, no consistency, they should notify their passenger before the scheduled flights that they change the rules A flight attendant was braiding her hair, during the entire flight, using a stainless steel coffee pot as a mirror, really unpleasant to watch. Never again. Flying next week with United.",-1
2020-07-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Atlanta,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,The inconsistency is terrible,True,  Dallas Ft Worth to Atlanta. I have never had a problem with baggage until now. I have used the same suitcase for every flight but on a recent flight I was made to pay. Several other flyers had bags of the same size and they were not charged. The inconsistency is terrible. The flight attendant informed me it was because my bag had wheels and the others were duffle bags. If you want a CHEAP flight this is the way to go. However don't expect anything but a basic service. Also the flight is packed!,-1
2020-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Cleveland via Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never use Spirit,True,  I brought my mom one way tickets from Puerto Rico to Ohio. My mom is 78 years with underlying conditions therefore I paid for her to sit at the window (21A) this way she wouldn't have anyone sitting on her left side. She gets in the plane and some guy is sitting in her purchased seat and refused to get out of her seat and none of the flight attendants instructed him to get out of her seat. They also were trying to charge her an additional $60 for the same baggage allowed free of charge on other flights. I will never use Spirit for me or my family no matter how cheap because really they're not cheap. I'd rather spend my money on an airline that is honest with their pricing from the beginning and an airline that'll stand up for what is right especially when it comes to our elderly.,-1
2020-07-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Ft. Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,we weren't able to take this flight,True,  Because of the pandemic our hotel and cruise from Florida were cancelled so we weren't able to take this flight to FT. Lauderdale on April 20th. At that time most of the airlines were cancelling the flights. Spirit Airlines had an online form that I filled out to get my refund but I've never received it since then.,-1
2020-07-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Ft Lauderdale, FL to Atlanta, GA",1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1.0,So much for saving money,False,"  I flew Spirit for the first time today. Like most travelers I try to find the best bang for my buck. After having flown AA from Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale I was unprepared for my return flight via Spirit. The check-in process was easy enough but I quickly found that my carry on (which was free with AA) was going to cost me $50 with Spirit. So much for saving money. The boarding process was a bit hectic. They load by zones but it doesn't really matter because I saw several people among the first boarders that were seated in the same zone as I was. One of which had managed to stroll onto the plane with a mixed drink and an open beer. After boarding the plane I discovered that while I was required to wear a protective mask, the 6 foot personal space rule didn't matter in the least. We were packed in like sardines! The staff was adequate but I did notice one steward who never covered his nose with his mask. The seats were narrow and hard. I'm glad the flight was only 2 hours. I don't think I've ever been that uncomfortable on a flight. The pilot seemed very adequate but he seemed to struggle a bit on the landing. To be fair, we did have to circle about 40 minutes to allow a storm to pass but once it was clear he seemed to come in a bit ""hot"". All in all the money I thought I was saving seemed to disappear once the baggage fees and discomfort was factored in. Spirit will definitely not be receiving any more business from me. I'll just spend a bit extra and feel more comfortable.",-1
2020-07-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never again fly Spirit,False, I had used my own carry on bag to fly from BWI to TPA. No issue ever. I go back to TPA to fly back hone to BWI and they make me check my bag this time for $65.00 at the gate. This was my own personal item for under the seat. They claimed it didn’t fit. It in fact did. I will never again fly Spirit. The seats suck and so does the service.,-1
2020-07-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,it was a horrible experience,True," We flew out Friday to go to Orlando Florida. I will never fly with Spirit again. We were delayed 12 times, we were supposed to leave at 2.36, end up not leaving till 3 in the morning. No food or drinks for 10 hours. For my daughters first time flying it was a horrible experience. Every time we fly with them for the last 3 times there has always been a delay. Luckily we used all our credit we will definitely pay more to fly with another airline. Never have a good experience with them. Even on the way back again a delay. So upsetting! If I were you pay the extra money fly with someone else.",-1
2020-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Atlanta,,,,,,,1.0,Can't call and speak to anyone,True,"  Cleveland to Atlanta with Spirit Airlines. Horrible from customer service to being delayed 4 different times. Can't call and speak to anyone. Been at the airport for 4 and a half hours, didn't get offered anything. Big inconvenience.",-1
2020-07-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Minneapolis,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,seats are hard as a rock,True,"  Spirit Airlines is objectively a pretty terrible airline, but that's what you get for booking at such a cheap fare, so if you're willing to travel light at a low cost, then it's a decent option. The cabin is completely bare bones without even as much as a magazine for entertainment. Even overhead luggage costs extra, and no food or drinks are free. Beware of endless credit card advertisements. Legroom is terrible and the seats are hard as a rock, but it was bearable for a 2.5 hour flight. Any longer would've been a major struggle. BWI and MSP Terminal 1 are both great facilities, even as the latter was dealing with a massive snowstorm on the busiest travel weekend in America (Thanksgiving). Again, objectively bad flight, but decent considering the cheap fares compared to other airlines' holiday weekend fares.",1
2020-07-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Philadelphia to Cancun, Mexico",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Their customer service is the worst,False,"  This was the worst airline ever. The flight was crowded with no social distances at all. I asked workers about people wearing masks only over their mouths but they totally ignored me. They also did not enforce mask staying on the entire flight. People were talking all over the place and they pulled their masks down. I felt totally unsafe. Not to mention their long layovers. I will not fly with them again ever. Spirit is not safe in this pandemic, they could not care less as long as their flights are full. Their customer service is the worst. Are you really saving money if they charge you for everything from seats to a bottle of water. Seats are small and uncomfortable.",-1
2020-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlantic City,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,choose another more reputable airline,False," I fly this airline at least 2 times a month. I have joined their fair club, etc. The most recent two trips were horrible. The first trip two weeks ago I was forced to pay a baggage fee for a bag that fit the criteria of a carry one, ya know the one you can stow under your seat. $65 I was charged. I called customer service and was told he couldn't verify my story so they couldn't refund or credit me. My most recent trip was just this past monday July 6. I arrived at the airport a little late due to traffic. My flight left at 12:54 and I arrived at the airport at 12:30. You have to check in at least 15 minutes prior to departure. Hum, that's more like 20 minutes I got there. Atlantic city airport is small. I could have gotten right through, but was told I was too late and forced to pay $198 to get on the next flight. Mind you my original round trip flight was not even close to being that much money. Again called customer service who simply sent me Spirit's policy. My family of 10 who frequently fly spirit will no longer do so. We will choose another more reputable airline who will work with their loyal customers.",-1
2020-07-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Austin, TX to Newark, NJ via Detroit and Orlando",2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,Terrible mistake,False,"  I thought I would try Spirit just once. Terrible mistake. They charged me $120 online for one bag and then $125 more for the one bag because it was 15 pounds overweight. So $245 for one LL Bean rolling duffle bag. The plane wasn't crowded thankfully, but the toilet in the restroom was completely crusted with faeces. When I checked in for a connection flight, the agent checked me in as female although I have a beard, low voice and there is nothing effeminate about me. TSA turned me away, and I had to go back to the ticket agent and start over.",-1
2020-07-02,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver via Baltimore,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,demanded that I pay for my bag,True,"  I’ve flown with Spirit Airlines many times in the past. Mostly out of convenience and competitive prices, all with the same “Zone 3” ticket and the same hiking backpack. I have never paid for a carry on, extra bag, personal item or checked bag. However, this trip was different. I was picked out of line and told that I had pay 65$ to take my backpack on the plane. In front of the entire line, this Spirit airline employee demanded that I pay for my bag. This was especially shocking to me because it was a connecting flight and I was not confronted or asked about my bag.",-1
2020-06-30,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Las Vegas,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,4.0,staff were really great,True,"  I am not loyal to airlines. I fly 3-4 times a year, and I just always book whichever flight is cheapest. This time I booked with Spirit and had a lap infant (17 months old). I packed for both of us in a personal item sized suitcase and they let me take a diaper bag on free of charge (as well as stroller and car seat which were checked). People often gripe that Spirit charges extra for everything, but they don’t catch you off guard - you know going in that you’ll have to pay extra for additional bags, seat selection, printed boarding pass etc. The staff were really great, both at the airport and onboard. On a returning flight they moved my seat (with baby) and my husband’s to an empty row so we could sit together. We hadn’t even asked. The flight attendants on both flights were really kind and helpful too. Also, I like Spirit’s seats - they seem cleaner than other airlines.",1
2020-06-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,"Delayed 3 hours, bad attitude",True,"  Cleveland to Orlando. Delayed 3 hours, bad attitude, delay and extra 30 minutes and still no answers . After all this I ask to change my seat to the front so I can get faster when we arrive to Orlando and she want it charge me premium price for it.",-1
2020-05-30,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,very nice and very attentive,False,"  The flight attendants on our flight on May 26th coming home from Los Angeles were very professional, very nice and very attentive to our needs.  A big shout-out to Diego, Logan and Rosalinda for all there services and what they do on a daily basis. Thank you.",-1
2020-05-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,a poor excuse for a company,False,"  I booked a family vacation back in March. The flights were cancelled due to the virus but Spirit Airlines said they can only is a credit not a refund. I said ok because I knew we would take that flight again later in the year when the virus is not so wide spread. I then find out that Spirit is no longer flying out of the airport that I live near anymore. I contact them to find out if I can get a refund now since they no longer fly the airport I live near. The closest one they now fly out of is 6 hours away from me. They said they still can issue no refund and credit is all I get and I just need to drive the 6 hours if I want to use that credit. I did some research and saw that the IS Department of Transportation issues a guidance that all airlines are required to issue refunds if the cancelations are due to the virus. However even after telling Spirit that, they still say I’m just out my $1192 I spent on tickets that we can never use now. This is a poor excuse for a company and I hope other people are not getting treated the same as our family. I will fly Delta from now on and hope you do as well.",-1
2020-05-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,chosen to not give refunds,True,"  I do not think good customer services is provided to customers who travel with this selfish, in it for the profit and the profit, not concerned with people airline. During a national pandemic, this greedy airline has chosen to not give refunds. You could not pay me to ride or booked a flight with Spirit every in life again. Cheap is right!",-1
2020-05-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,one year credit - no refunds,True,"  Spirit shows a lot of fluff while screwing their passengers. I purchased a cheap nonrefundable one way ticket last January, and for obvious reasons cancelled before my travel in April. They offer a one year credit - no refunds. Now that the world is beginning to get back on its feet, we know that we will never live the same life again. and a ticket that expires in January 2021 is the same as throwing $200 over my shoulder. Does anyone know what our world will look like in January 2021? So I called and asked for a refund (again). the agent read the script and bottom line - nope and no extensions. For the first time ever, the agent and I (we) are all in the same boat. And we discussed that. So, in an effort to see what they could do, the agent had a supervisor call me back. He did call me and read the same script. And his response: tough! Use the ticket by January 2021 or you are out $200.00. The most amazing thing about this is that I purchased a comparable ticket on Southwest at the same time (for the return trip.) And today I was advised that Southwest's ""use in one year"" policy has already been extended until - January 2022! I never even had to ask.",-1
2020-05-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,not worth the frustration,False,"  Spirit Airlines has had a terrible track record for a number of flights I have taken, but this last one will cause me to avoid them forever. I had a connecting flight in a city that was twice as far as my destination, which was acceptable to me because of the low prices. However, there was only an hour between the connecting flights. We began boarding 30 min late and I told the employees I was afraid I was going to miss my connection. They assured me there would be no issue and told me my best option was to board. I did so, and when I arrived myself and two others on that connection were left stranded in Baltimore. At the gate the spirit employees were helpless and could not provide anything. I left the gate and went to the spirit ticket counter. They informed me the next flight was tomorrow, or they could fly me back to LAX in six hours. They would NOT provide a hotel or a ticket on a different airline. I have never come across that before. I asked for a refund and was told that I would be given a ticket voucher directly to my account. I then was forced to pay out of pocket on a different airline just to make it to my destination. Once I checked my account I found I had not been given a voucher. Three days and half a dozen phone calls later I finally received a voucher number. Upon attempting to use the voucher I found ALL days were unavailable until further notice. A dozen more phone calls got me a plethora of explanations all of which ended with, ""sorry, there is nothing we can do."" I have wasted so much time and money on this airline. If this happens to you even once it is going to ruin your trip and cause hours of unnecessary work and wasted time. The cheap prices are not worth the frustration this airline will eventually cause you. I cannot dissuade you enough from taking this airline.",-1
2020-05-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Charleston, WV to Orlando, FL",,,,,,,1.0,hope that my refund was processed,False,"  I called this morning after speaking with other parents from my daughter's cheer gym. Our cheer competition was canceled in March. I canceled my flight on March 16th & received my vouchers. As COVID-19 started to shut down more events, we realized that the cheer competition would not be rescheduled. And, the government was asking airlines to refund travel. Several parents said that they called Spirit and received refunds after the initial cancelation of their flights. One of my friends told me she called this morning, so I decided to call and ask for a refund. She said that the process was simple. She stated that she wasn't given any hassle & it was a good experience. When I called, the representative told me that he was unable to process a refund on the phone, but I could receive a refund if I went online and requested it. I told him that I had a friend that called this morning & she was refunded over the phone. He told me he could not help me, so I asked him to transfer me to someone who may be able to. He transferred me to his supervisor, who proceeded to tell me that I wasn't warranted a refund at all & that he could give me an additional $50.00 on my voucher. I told him that the other representative told me I could get a refund online & he told me that wasn't true. So, the first person told me I could get a refund, but they weren't able to do it. And, his supervisor told me that a refund wasn't authorized at all. I told him about the friend I mentioned above and told him a voucher didn't do me any good because I am not an airline traveler. He hung up on me. This was 17 minutes of conversation. I called back & talked with Zamie. She told me that the supervisor put notes in the system that he was ""disconnected"". No, he clearly hung up when I asked him about why they issued refunds to other individuals. I gave her both reservation numbers and full names. She looked them up & verfied their refunds. After 53 minutes on the line with Zamie, she told me that she wasn't able to issue a refund either, because ""I"" canceled my flight .. not Spirit. I told her that the other two individuals did the exact same thing that I had done. And, I was following the same protocol. So, I was curious why I wasn't warranted the same refund that Spirit gave to other customers. We had the same flight to the same location & all of us canceled online and received vouchers. Once I told her I had received an email from Spirit that my flight was canceled, she put me on hold & issued the refund. So, I spent an hour & ten minutes this morning talking with people that told me I wasn't authorized a refund & finally gave me a refund. I understand that there are guidelines & rules in place. But, in times like these understanding goes a long way. And, I would understand if the answer was ""no, vouchers only"" to every single traveler. But, I personally knew of 2 different families that received refunds & I was being denied one under the same circumstances. Zamie was helpful, but her hands were tied. Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in Spirit Airlines. My husband is a retired Marine of 30 years & I served 5 years in the Air Force. I wasn't asking for something that was impossible. I was asking for the same service other people were given. I am hoping that other customers aren't having to jump through the same hoops I had to catapult myself through. People are out of jobs. People are scared. I truly hope that my refund was processed & I will get my money.",-1
2020-04-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Orlando,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,The flight was terrible,True,"  Philadelphia to Orlando. I was disgusted for the passengers and flight crew. There was a large group of people That were traveling together that basically ran the plane. They did not follow directive to sit they stood in the aisles hovering over other passengers and their children did the same. The group was loud, obnoxious and the flight crew had no control. I couldn’t order a beverage because they could not get the cart through the aisle because of all the people standing. When we exited the plane it was trashed with spilled milk all over the seats and trash everywhere. Not to mention we didn’t leave the runway until 25min after scheduled time because some other group traveling together were late and needed to board. On top of that there was technical difficulties which made the plane return back to the terminal. We landed an hour and a half later then we were scheduled. The flight was terrible due to the lack of control over this large group traveling together. The flight attendants were loosing their patience and were ignoring the rest of the passengers due to dealing with the large group traveling together. No excuse I paid my money the same way they did. Moving forward Spirit will not be my first choice.",-1
2020-04-23,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,Very frustrated by Spirit,True,"  Very frustrated by Spirit Airlines! I have purchased tickets for my family on Feb 24th (3 seat places = $350.44) for the flight on Feb 27th over to Fort Lauderdale. Because of the COVID-19 news that came up later on TV News I decided not to take a risk and canceled for 2 seats (for my wife and daughter = $222.78) within 6 hours but kept one for myself for business purposes. The Spirit Customer Service has offered me credit that I could use and I was ok with that because I needed to buy a flight for my way back to Chicago. Everything went fine but I still couldn't receive a confirmation email from Spirit Airlines about my flight details. Then I've called them back again and I was surprised when I heard that they don't see any booked flight from Fort Lauderdale back to Chicago under my name. I was super frustrated because of wasted time and decided to refund my full amount. After intense discussion with an agent (and agent with her manager), they have agreed to return my money. After that, I bought a ticket from United Airlines and was all set. But, again, I have not received my confirmation about the refund. When I called them again they said they see my flight that was reserved from Fort Lauderdale (they couldn't see that flight on their system one day before), when I heard that I wanted to send them to the Moon. I have kept very polite and explained that I've already purchased one with another airline and wanted to refund money. They refused to return it, they forced/kept that flight (with no show further of course), and left me with $14 credit. I've tired of calls with them and decided to save my nervousness and health. I am super upset about Spirit Airlines, about their Customer Service and their unsynced database system. I am a Software Engineer myself and sure they need to start to invest in their systems/db servers.",-1
2020-04-22,0.8,Business,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlantic City,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,4.0,Good job Spirit,True,"  I would like to start this review by stating this was the very first time I have ever been personally thanked for flying Spirit by the in-flight crew. I was pleasantly shocked and surprised. That small detail made the in-flight experience that much more pleasant. The airplane was brand new and like I recommend in every review, please spend the extra few dollars and upgrade to the big front seat if you can and if available. That is one of the main reasons I continue to fly Spirit the big front seat gives you the business class comfort without the price tag. The checkin experience at Fort Lauderdale was also more pleasant than what it usually is so overall for this particular experience I have to give two thumbs up. We left on time and arrived early. Good job Spirit, now all you need is b..consistency. I fly Spirit multiple times a year.",1

Not only did Spirit charge me a $90 change fee, but after one month I am still trying to get a refund for the original ticket cost. The text system is useless and they do not offer the ability to speak to a live person.",-1

There are no words to describe my frustration with this airline. My flight to Puerto Rico was leaving today April 14, 2020 at 5:40am and at the time of check-in they indicated that the airline was closed and had canceled all flights. The airline never notified me of the cancellation. I contacted them and they offered me three alternatives, first was that they would return the money but that it takes time to register in my bank account, second is that I have a one-year pass to fly with them again and third that the closest flight is on June 10, 2020. I am a police officer in PR and I am banned at the Dallas airport to pay another hotel and transportation to figure out what can I do.",-1
2020-04-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Sacramento,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,they won't return money,True,"  Two airfare tickets  was purchased on January 6 to fly from Philadelphia to Sacramento. We were supposing to fly on February 13, (PHL-DFW-LAS-SMF) and comeback on Monday February 17. (SMF-LAS-PHL) (Conf #E9PE5S). About two weeks later I decided to look for a rental car in Sacramento (SMF) airport. To my surprise, I was not able to see my flight from Sacramento back to Philadelphia, only from Philadelphia to Sacramento. I was shocked. Immediately I called Expedia and ask them what is going on. They told me that the Spirit airlines for some reason cancelled the flight from Sacramento to Philadelphia, and left the first part of the flight which is from Philadelphia to Sacramento. I was so upset at Spirit, if not to say more. No one called me or say something from Spirit that they can't provide flight back from Sacramento to Philadelphia. So I was asking Expedia on how they will fix the problem. The solution was that they (Expedia) will buy another (completely new) ticket from Philadelphia to Sacramento and back for us. Than from that new trip they will refund the Philadelphia - Sacramento portion of the flight, because it was still walled with the Spirit, and they did. So, at the end we were flying to Sacramento with the Spirit, and back with Expedia portion of the flight. Expedia already refunded one portion of the flight (Philadelphia-Sacramento), and we want refund from the Spirit (Sacramento-Philadelphia) portion in the amount of $314.36 (that is the price for the Sacramento-Philadelphia part) And now Spirit says that they won't return money, because I didn't show up to the return flight that was cancelled. This is absurd!I don’t know what is wrong with them?",-1
2020-04-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to San Jose,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no word to describe my frustrations,False,"  They changed my flight to my home country half an hour before leaving, after paying $150 of taxi to get to the airport and they told without any reason me that the flight was cancelled and I had to go home to wait for the next available flight. After hours of arguing with them they decided to give me a flight with another airline and they told me that I didn't have to pay anything. Without considering the fact that the flight was leaving in less than an hour and I needed to do another time che check in for the luggage and all this in another part of the airport that can only be reach by train. I had no word to describe my frustrations. I run to the train and get to the other terminal. I reached the check in and the employees of the other airline tell me that I had to pay $40 plus for the luggage. I said that is not possible, the other guys told me that it was included. Nothing to do, if I wanted to get my luggage on the plane I had to pay. They told me that for any complain I had to go to the other terminal. With the new flight I had to make a scale of 12 hours in another airport.",-1

My children and I had to be on our flight at 6 a.m. on 3/16/2020 so we arrived 2 hours early at the Portland, OR airport. My children and I were approached by an employee that worked for Spirit airlines who was extremely rude when I tried asking questions about the luggage policy. She did not answer my questions and walked away to answer another customer's question. Another rude Spirit employee was very nasty and short with people. When she was done putting the tags on my luggage she never directed me and my children on where we were supposed to go and she gave us attitude the entire time. Finally, at gate D6 Spirit employee was very rude and unprofessional. He yelled at me to get out of line due to Spirit making an error excluding my 1-year-old on my ticket. I wasn't moving fast enough for him so he rushed me out of line. I will never ever buy another ticket from Spirit again because of the unprofessional employees. My kids and I went through a lot of trouble due to Spirit's errors just to board our flight.",-1
2020-03-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,compensation we got was ridiculous,True,"  Houston to Newark. Me and my friend were supposed to fly back home to NYC on 2/23, but they kicked us out of the plane and rescheduled our flight for 2/25 because my friend “looked sick and needed to talk to a doctor”. The doctor asked if we went to China in the last 2 weeks, the answer was no. However they did not allow us back on the plane, and my checked bag flew to Newark. I went to the luggage office to ask them to send my bag back, and no one was there even though it was during their operating hours. I called the number provided at the door, no one picked up. Later that day, a passenger from the same flight called me to tell me that he has my case and gave me the address of his hotel in NYC to come and pick it up. Not only that I lost two days at work, but also I had those additional expanses for staying two more days in Houston, and I was without my bag because it was picked up by another passenger. We called them several times and filed several complaints- the response was - “we’ll call you back” or the ticket was passed on to another department. They were sorry that we had to reschedule our flight and they were happy that I was able to reunite with my bag. After one month of conversing back and fourth, they offered two $100 vouchers, refunded $85 for my checked bag and $12 for my toiletries that I bought in Houston. They did not cover other expenses, including our accommodation, and transportation from/to the airport and to the hotel where my bag was situated. We went through embarrassment on the plane, stress about my lost bag, additional expanses and suffering due to rescheduled flight, but the compensation we got was ridiculous. We also spent so much time negotiating for that little compensation they gave us. I will never ever choose Spirit Airlines.",-1

They cancelled us 7 times with no results. We had to fly out on another Airline. Spirit Airlines tried to get us to pay extra money for a flight we already paid for weeks in advance. We were stuck in vegas for 2 days with no help from Spirit Airlines. This company had no reason after the first day not to fly out of vegas. Spirit Airlines told us flight is confirmed for the 21st and at 7 pm you cancelled again. Do they not realize how stressful this is and do they care?,-1

Had to purchase another ticket from a different airline. Don't understand why  Spirit could not or did not want to honor there flights. I know Jet Blue, Delta and American airlines still had flights and were willing to assist in getting citizens out of the country. Spirit took the money and ran. United States Government should not help this airline out. Spirit did Nothing for its passengers that had tickets purchased.",-1

If you know what you’re paying for in advance, and understand what our ticket price includes, you can get where you’re going safely and with courtesy, and in surprising comfort if you play your cards right. My wife and I paid extra for “big front seats” and for one checked bag, and we’re still able to get to our destination for half of what American would have charged us. We brought snacks on board, and snuck some vodka and gin miniatures with us to save money, and just had to pay the $9 for three mixers from the flight crew. Don’t like their prices for Diet Coke and Bloody Mary Mix? Don’t buy them. Our friends who were traveling with us could not make the flight because one had emergency surgery. Spirit, upon request, agreed to offer them credit for the flight despite their policy of not odpffering credits or refunds. I’d say that was a bit more than fair. I’ll happily fly Spirit again.",1

I will pay more through any other airline before I give them a cent of my money...they have a policy that they emphasize on their boarding passes that say they close the doors 15 minutes before departure. It's only 3 minutes, but it matters when you're a big airline who has a policy .. you would expect that I can trust you to follow your own policies and schedules.I had a 648 pm flight last night from philly to orlando. I got to the gate at 630 on the dot .. the door was closed! I located a supervisor at 633 at the time it was supposed to be closing, and she confirmed that she received a text from a worker at 630pm letting her know that he was closing the gate .. for 1 that is still early, and for 2 that's a lie because I got there at 630. I was forced to wait for another flight at 6am this morning, and pay $142 for a hotel room because they didnt follow their own policies m scheduling,not to mention the extra cash u had to dish out for outside food, park and fly.

Months ago before the corona virus outbreak I booked with Spirit seeing as it was cheap at the time, I decided to give them a chance. Now that there is no other options but the world to stay inside and try and work together to stop the spread of the virus. Ive been trying to get my flight managed. I have now been on the phone for 2 and a half hours in order to get an answer about my flight leaving tomorrow, March 18th.

Spirit Airlines charge for a bottle of water, seats, checked bags, and carry-on bags, no wifi or entertainment on the planes. Spirit Airlines have the most inconvenient times, late at night or early in the morning and some days do not have flights. My flight from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando was just cancelled because of a computer glitch. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before the previous flight. At least they should tell the people on the plane that we can get off after one try of trying to fix the computer problem. Then we get a notification on the Spirit app that the flight has been cancelled before the crew told us that the flight was cancelled. Spirit Airlines didn’t even send an email about how they are dealing with the corona virus and what they are doing to keep the planes clean to protect your customers!

2020-03-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cali to Pittsburgh via Fort lauderdale,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2.0,received no support from Spirit,False,"  Cali to Pittsburgh via Fort Lauderdale. I received no support from Spirit during this time. Beginning from when I left the plane that arrived late on March 10th, I was telling every spirit agent I could find that my connection was leaving in less than 1 hour. My boyfriend took the exact flight the next day and told me that Spirit agents asked people who deboarded the plane if they had a connection in less than 2 hours that they could move to the front of the line. I received no such help. When I finally made it through customs and immigration I asked the spirit agents at the desk in front of security if I would make it to the flight (it was about 11:35 and the plane was scheduled to leave at 11:45. It ended up leaving at 11:40) they said it would be tight but that I would go through security. Spirit agents knew that I was going through security for my flight but didn’t even call the gate and let me miss the flight anyway? I don’t understand why they let me through and allowed me to run all the way when they weren’t even going to call the gate or make sure I made it on the flight? Once I made it to the ticketing desk to rebook the flight initially they had booked me on a flight back to my original destination vs back home. A mistake I caught and received no apologies for. I finally spoke to two on duty supervisors who made me wait for about an hour trying to find an answer. Ultimately they didn’t do anything for me after making me wait for so long. My travel time doubled because of spirits bad scheduling. From 8 hours to 16 hours. Spirit forced me to stay in the airport for this long because I had such extreme anxiety about missing my next flight too (never offered me anything for wasting my time). I was paranoid my next flight would leave early too. I will never recommend or fly Spirit myself again.",-1

I knew this when I booked my direct flight. The flight was scheduled for 12:40 (40 minutes past midnight). Flight got delayed until 2am. My associate and I were in a business trip. Worked hard all day, and timed everything to enjoy Vegas and sleep in the plane. We ended up taking off at around 2:30, we were dead tired, looking forward to the 2 hours of sleep or so that the flight would permit. The lady at the gate was super nice and sat us on an exit row. Being 6 foot 2 I was very grateful. Now I knew I would be even more likely to get some rest. However a staff ended up storming up and down the plane an hour into the flight to demand, me, my associate and some guy behind us to show him our boarding passes. Even his colleague, who was a nice, polite pleasant, lady seemed to be calming him down assuring him those were our seats. He insisted for a while before scuttling back to the front of the plane. By then he had ruined our sleep, but I kept calm and complied with his request to dig out my boarding pass. I went to the front of the cabin and he gave me attitude saying ""you can look at my name tag!"" in a confrontational, entitled tone.",-1

This is now the 2nd time Spirit has cancelled a flight without proper notice. 1st time we were delayed almost 4 hours due to a crew shortage which they verbally announced over the loud speaker. After 4 hours, they ultimately cancelled the flight stating 'inclement weather' being the reason so they didn't have to compensate for their error. No offer to book hotels, supply ubers for this flight of almost 200 people. I missed a job interview because of this mishap and I had to practically stalk them for a partial refund. All the while, the staff was absolutely unprofessional, almost downright hateful towards all the passengers trying to rebook. Against my better judgement, I booked again trying to save a few bucks. Not even an hour before take off, I get an email that the flight was cancelled with no reason given. I am writing this review in hopes it will deter people from booking with this airline because the stress they cause is not worth the money 'you save'. Save yourself and book Frontier.",-1
2020-03-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,2.0,would not recommend to anyone,True,"  Newark to Houston. I am horrified with the treatment received on Spirit airlines. Traveling on Spirit airlines flight NK 703 from Newark to Houston on March 5, 2020, I encountered a very rude/unprofessional air hostess. There were at least 5 other victims of her horrible behavior. Despite being at least 20% empty seats, she would not allow any of these people to change their seats and if they did, she scolded them in a very demeaning manner. Despite being empty bins, she did not allow people to put their backpacks, coats, etc. and asked people with an attitude and mean manners to remove and keep their bags under their seats. I was in a row with 2 other heavy build elderly passengers. The lady next to me was not very cooperative and was encroaching my seat by removing the hand-rest between our seats. I was uncomfortable with her behavior. It is very uncomfortable to travel about 4 hours in such a situation, so I asked to go to a seat behind me, but the same air hostess did not allow me with belittling comments, telling that she does it only for certain people. She scolded and asked me to return to my seat. I asked her that she just told the other passenger that he could only move one row ahead or behind and I am asking to move just one seat behind then why I cannot? She told me that this was an order on behalf of Captain, asserting her authority unnecessarily in a rude manner. There was no need to invoke Captain's authority for such a simple issue. Two rows behind me (#23 and #24) were completely unoccupied (12 vacant seats). Also, she displayed a very cheap and unethical behavior – she tried to instigate the women next to me to falsely accuse me who strongly denied to her (Air hostesses’) pleading. I will never again fly with Spirit and would not recommend to anyone.",-1
2020-03-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,"  Tampa to Las Vegas. I have worked in customer service so I understand policies and procedures but being intentionally mistreated for no apparent reason is just unacceptable. The experience I had with Spirit airlines this past weekend were so far beyond terrible. My husband, myself and both of our families have traveled with different airlines for years and were shocked with the way we were treated. The worst airline I have ever encountered. We were heading to Las Vegas for my sister-in-law's wedding, we decided to check if we were able to change our flight to a day earlier for extra time. The woman on the on the phone would huff and puff so we could literally hear it. She was so annoyed that we wanted to modify our flight. So once we get to the airport, we confirmed that we paid extra for the seats with extra leg room. Once we made our way through security and were at the boarding counter, we noticed our boarding passes did not have the seats we requested to which they stated they ""didn't know what happened"" but although we paid, we did not get those seats. At this time we asked if a refund was available and were laughed at. We were not very happy about the situation flying to Las Vegas but just brushed it off. After a wonderful vacation, we arrived at the airport to head home. Our flight home was absolutely horrible. I have never been treated so poorly by staff in my life. We had asked at the desk to check in our bags what all needed to be checked, carry on, etc. they stated the two suit cases we would check and we each had 1 personal item with no charge. Once we got in line to board the plane we were stopped and asked about our bags. We had explained that we asked and were told we could carry what we had on for no charge .. they ended up giving us such a hard time, we had to pay for bags that we were able to bring for free on our flight which was obviously frustrating. One of the girls at the boarding counter looked me up and down several times and proceeded to intimidate me by staring at me and whispering to the other staff members. They kept threatening that they would take us off our flight because we were questioning why we had to pay again. They made us feel like low life, trashy people. Once we were finally able to board the plane, the woman flight attendant grabbed my husbands arm and told him ""we better not have any issues on this flight"" as we walked to our seats. She then proceeded to stop at our row every 2 seconds to tell me to push my bag under the seat .. it was completely under the seat, I hadn't touched the bag since we sat down. We then spent our entire overnight flight, being the only row with the over head lights stuck on. Not only have we been hung up on over the phone multiple times, we have been so mistreated, we will never fly this airline again. I would rather walk than take a flight with rude staff, uncomfortable seats, no wifi, missing half the food and drinks on the menu, etc.",-1
2020-03-05,0.7,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Tampa,1.0,,3.0,,,5.0,4.0,seats are really only two hour seats,True,"  We had two perfect flights on Spirit. Outbound left 5 minutes late and return left 5 minutes early. A couple of things I learned. First, as crazy as the baggage policy is, you can see the true impact on boarding and deplaning. With so few carry ons, boarding goes really fast. Their A320 has the widest aisle of any airplane I have been on. There were absolutely no issues and no drama in either Baltimore or Tampa. In fact, the airport staff and airline staff were all friendly and helpful. Now the seats are really only ""two hour"" seats. After two hours you'd rather be sitting anywhere else. The tray table is the smallest on any airline I have flown. There is enough room for a drink and a phone and nothing else. The seatback pocket consists of two bungee cords crisscrossed. My guess is it was deliberately done to prevent you from storing anything in there. And the seats themselves are remarkably uncomfortable. The padding is probably an inch thick. They have a weird curvature to them. But there is a reasonable amount of legroom. If you are a large person (wide), then the width may be an issue for you. If you fly for a living and are used to more perks (food, boarding, front row seats, free bags, etc>) then this airline is definitely not for you. If you are traveling light, want a cheap price, and can tolerate an uncomfortable seat for a few hours then this airline may work for you. In our case, we knew about the baggage costs, thought we knew about the seats (you can't until you sit in them), and heard all the negative comments posted here and still went ahead with the booking. Everything worked out fine. The price + the baggage + the seats was still cheaper than Southwest. Everything worked out fine for us. If you read all the comments on here, you would think they never take off on time. Know the pricing of amenities before you go, Know the carry on size limitation. You are flying a discount airline. They discount the price by saving in other areas. If that works for you, then do it. If you are the type that gets upset when they charge for water onboard, don't do it. It does seem like connecting flights may be an issue. In our case we flew nonstop. For two hours or less, I would do it again. For anything over that, I would really have to be sucked in by the price.",1

They only came down with the cart once. When I told them my dissatisfaction they didn't care. I was even nice about it.",-1
2020-03-02,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Ft Lauderdale,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0, went above and beyond helping us,False,  Columbus to Ft Lauderdale. I had never flown on Spirit airlines before and I had only ever heard bad things about it. My wife and I recently got tickets to fly from Columbus to fort Lauderdale to go on a 7-day cruise in the Caribbean. We missed our flight from Columbus but Cortney and Telon went above and beyond in helping us get a flight to a nearby airport so that we could make our cruise on time. The seats weren't amazing but I would honestly prefer to book through Spirit knowing that I would get that quality of customer service over an airline that had more comfortable seats but significantly worse customer service.,1
2020-03-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled at last minute,True,"  Houston to Tampa. Never again. Flight cancelled at last minute, no reason. Customer service could not help after a long wait. Use a bigger airline, do not use Spirit.",-1
2020-03-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to LaGuardia,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worth avoiding this airline.,True,"  Ft Lauderdale to LaGuardia. I am a musician that flies regularly and have flown with every domestic company. Spirit is  by far the worst. Worse than southwest, worse than delta, which is saying a lot. After boarding my 11 am flight, we sat on the tarmac for 40 minutes before they made us deplane because of a maintenance issue. They proceeded to delay the flight by an hour, every hour, for 12 hours, without giving any concrete information. At 6pm, they gave us a $7 food vouchers. Seven dollars to feed yourself for 12 hours at airport prices. The customer service workers, both in person and by phone, were so unhelpful and rude. Customer service either hung up the phone or (in person) would start ignoring you after a minute or two. When me and several other flyers demanded to speak to a supervisor, they called the Sherriffs Office and had 5 cops show up. Avoid at all costs. The lower prices translate to subhuman treatment of customers. Any amount of money is worth avoiding this airline.",-1
2020-03-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft. Lauderdale to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,my checked bag was missing,False,"  Ft. Lauderdale to Dallas. When I landed in Dallas my checked bag was missing. Received little to no help from employees, acted as if they didn't care and very rude. Was told when they knew something I would know something. Got back home and called next day and was told it was found. Asked why I wasn't notified sooner and was told they were to busy. They told me that my bag had been sent by FedEx. Contacted FedEx and was told it wasn't. Called Spirit back and was told I would get it next tuesday. Emailed spirit to tell them my house, car and business keys were in bag and needed it sooner than that, never got response.",-1
2020-02-28,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Spirit gets the job done,True,"  It's hilarious that people fly on an admitted ultra low cost carrier and complain that their experience wasn't up to par with Emirates first class. Spirit gets the job done. If you are traveling light and only want a seat and a small bag, it's impossible to beat. I don't want a free soda or snack on my 2 hour plane ride. I don't need massive amounts of legroom on a short hop. Spirit has low fares because they don't have the massive amount of resources other carriers have. They can't control the weather, so when you're flight is delayed because it came out late in it's last location you can't complain at them. To ""win"" with Spirit you have to travel light and be ready for some minor headaches, pretty much the standard with all carriers now, at least Spirit admits flying isn't an enjoyable experience unless you're forking over a couple grand each way. I found the flight attendants to be very kind and professional. They moved me to the exit row twice. I was kind and wasn't rude or nasty to any employees, which a lot of other passengers were. I realize other passengers are upset because their family couldn't sit together after their Disney trip and their bags were full of unneeded stuff that they ended up getting charged for, but what do you expect?",1
2020-02-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Saint Thomas,1.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,said next flight is tomorrow,False,"  We got to the airport 45 minutes before flight because of an accident. The system was down and no one except for one guy made an attempt to help. The supervisor and staff should not work in the public. Flight from Fort Lauderdale to St Thomas, date 02/27/2020/ flight Time 1:10pm. I know the flight did not leave on time, how could it when the system is down. We drove from Orlando to Fort Lauderdale to catch this flight. I ended up spending 2000 for 4 one way ticket, because of an event we have obligations to in saint Thomas. We asked the staff is there anything you can do, they said next flight is tomorrow and it is 99.00 per person to change it. This is my second time flying with these clowns, not ever again. Do yourself a favor and pay extra and save your sanity.",-1
2020-02-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Detroit via Atlanta,1.0,4.0,5.0,,,3.0,3.0,travel at your own risk,True,"  Minneapolis to Detroit via Atlanta. I've been traveling Spirit for many years, and I've learned to accept certain cons that come with traveling with a low-cost carrier like expensive baggage fees, minimized foot room, no on-flight USB ports, no media, no free snacks/drinks, and frequent travel delay. However, there are some things that I don't think should be skimped on, which Spirit makes a habit of. For example, when a flight is canceled or delayed to the point of missing a connection due to the fault of the airline, they should do everything in their power to make it right. Either that means scheduling their customers on the next available flight (no matter the carrier) or compensating them with travel vouchers that actually have real value. Two years ago, my brother and I were getting on a plane to go from Atlanta to Minneapolis. Upon boarding, our seats were taken. The gate agent asked us to step off and upon doing so, the plane left without us because it was overbooked and the agent tricked us into staying back. They then offered us ""free flight"" vouchers, which appeased the situation a little. Upon returning home, we discovered how worthless those vouchers actually were. My brother and I each emailed Spirit and eventually received real travel vouchers, which should have been given to us without our needing to fight for them. Fast forward to last weekend, and my flight from Minneapolis to Atlanta (with a layover in Detroit) was delayed due to mechanical issues on the airplane. We missed our connection in Detroit (it was leaving the adjacent gate as we were pulling up), and the ticketing agent was adamant that he would not book us on the next available flight from any airline but would only give us a flight the next day on Spirit. After calling on the phone, we were told that there was nothing they could do because it was at the discretion of the ticketing/gate agent. I completed a complaint form on Spirit.com/help the next day and a woman got back to me to offer two $50 travel vouchers. But once again, those travel vouchers are nothing more than salt on a wound. They're not a compensation for a wrong. They probably make Spirit money, because the person who uses them will book a flight that they weren't otherwise going to book, and then only receives a few dollars off of the actual flight since the vouchers only cover what they call the ""base flight"" rate. Other airlines don't do this practice, because it's not right. In an effort to keep their costs low, they're cutting corners on basic customer decency. In summary, travel at your own risk.",-1

Absolutely the worst processes I’ve ever seen. They charge you a small fortune to check a bag, and when you get to the airport to check that bag they make you wait in a huge line even though they have kiosks for you to print the bag tag by yourself. Nothing special for 1st class either.",-1
2020-02-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,hopefully never again,False,  Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. I have flown Spirit many times and hopefully never again. I have continued to have problems with the Spirit personnel (agent assistance and baggage drop). They send you to one place for assistance and then to another and then move people in front of you for no apparent reason. All customer service seem to be very proficient in rudeness instead of actually providing service. I have no intentions of giving this company any more of mine or my companies money.,-1

2020-02-26,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to New Orleans,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,5.0,a great experience!,True,  Raleigh to New Orleans. I do not write reviews often. I felt that I needed to on this. We flew Spirit for the first time last week. I must say I was very worried about it. Before I purchased the tickets me and my husband read reviews. We read some horrible things. Everything from pushing flights back because the plane wasnt filled to the staff being hateful. We even heard that its was nasty and the flight staff wouldn't help you if you needed assistance. With all that being said we decided to chance it! I must say that it was a great experience! Everyone was nice and friendly. We all laughed and joked with everyone. The planes were super clean. We left on time both flights! No there isnt tons of space but your getting a great deal so if you need a bunch of leg room pay the extra money for first class or the emergency exit.  Thank you spirit for a great experience!,1

I had a flight scheduled to leave from Chicago to San Diego and it was cancelled just hours before departure without any option to get another. When I called to get another flight or some type of solution the customer service was terrible, careless, and unreliable. Thankfully United airlines came to the rescue and I was able to get to San Diego. But my flight back home to Chicago from San Diego (which was also booked months in advanced) had a delay without a notice. I will never fly with airline again. They do not care about their customers, only money.",-1

I’m an experienced traveler and I decided to book Spirit because currently low on money and Spirit wasn’t horrible for me I’m the past. After this flight I will never be taking it again. Our flight was delayed 2 hours. We were told an hour before we were suppose to take off. When we finally do land our luggage does not come out for over an hour.

I paid for my brother flight ticket for Spirit and I saw that it was $315 for this flight, and other airlines where like $350-$450. I saw that the Spirit Airlines price was the cheapest. That wasn’t the case. When he got to the terminal they charged $55 for a standard carry on. I basically paid $370 for this flight. I felt like they tricked me.",-1

This is the 2nd time we’ve had to fly Spirit and it’s always issues. This time we found out that the flight would be delayed 30 mins, but gate was changed, so we had to walk half way thru airport to wait, we got there only to find out there was a 2nd delay, plus the gate changed back to the original gate! Walk all the way back. Definitely will never fly Spirit. Adding insult to injury is that customer service doesn’t even have the courtesy to explain what were the delays!",-1

Cheap tickets doesn't mean you can cheat customers with delays and cancellations. Sometimes it's understandable that flights may get cancelled but for spirit airlines this happens again and again. This is the second time my flight got cancelled and I have to return home with my family. Please do yourself a favor and never ever book this airline. Don't get lured with saving few bucks, think wise and choose better airlines. Trust me in the end you'll end up paying more.",-1

Worst airline ever. Not did they not do anything about the annoyingly drunk people right behind me after several complaints from other passengers around, I also arrived without my luggage. For days no response about it, if it got found, where I can pick it up, nothing. I finally got it today, dirty and damaged. Well thanks for nothing spirit! The money safed in compare to other airlines I wasted on taxis to the airport, phone calls and replacements for the first few days as well as a new bag. Definitely CANNOT recommend Spirit airlines!

Checking the bag online and printing the tag was also routine. Since my wife and I were assigned random seats, my wife asked the receptionist if she could seat us together. We were assigned seats together even though the flight was sold out. There was a one-hour departure delay, which had something to do with high winds in Newark. The rest of the flight was pleasant and uneventful. We knew that this was a no-frills flight, so we did not expect any. I was satisfied with the flight and the price",1

I was flying home from Ohio after having two funerals for two different family members. I booked with spirit because of the price and time of flights, due to everything being last minute. During the flight my wallet dropped out of my purse. Once I realized this, I visited the Spirit desk where the lady printed two (I had my young daughter with me) gate passes to go back to the gate and retrieve the wallet. We had someone picking us up from the airport and had already received our luggage from the flight. We had to call our ride to put them on hold and go back through security with suitcases that weren’t carry-on size. They had been checked baggage. TSA yelled at us several times and said that a spirit rep should have brought the wallet down. By this time, my young daughter is sobbing and I was ready to cry myself. Thankfully TSA helped us get through and we were able to retrieve the wallet. Retrieving the wallet was another obstacle as the Spirit worker never confirmed what gate the wallet was at and no one seemed to know what we were talking about when we arrived to the gate. Horrible customer service and experience. I will not choose spirit for any future flights and I will encourage others to avoid this airline at all cost.",-1

They nickel and dime everything, including water on the flight. If your carry on bag is even a half inch larger than their allowance, they will charge you $65 dollars per flight. They will check your bag before you board.  This is a low class airline, would not fly with them again.",-1

We checked our bags and waited at gate 14 as directed. While there our plane was at the gate for over an hour. As we were getting ready to board an announcement came that our flight was being delayed for 5 hours for mechanical problems. Then another announcement came that people flying to Los Angeles were being changed to our gate. Photographed the plane number in front of the tail as it left. 5 hours later the same plane came to gate 15 for our flight to Detroit. It is not right to give our flight to someone else and make us wait 5 hours! When I called them out at the dest they said the plane needed repairs. I told them we were not stupid, we saw them board our plane with the LA people, They then offered us food vouchers. I was to arrive in Detroit at 7:30pm not 1:00AM. Whoever made this decision should be reprimanded and told how obviously stupid this ruse of mechanical repairs was to all passengers.",1

That was the worst decision I have ever made flying with Spirit Airlines. My son had a small backpack, they charged us $50.00 For my check in bags $43 then $23 more. Now when I came to my seat staff come to you and ask you to leave your assigned seat and go back. I didn’t move because I was seating with my kids. I don’t understand why they even have a spirit airlines with so bad services. Don’t fall for cheap airfare, they will make you pay more than Delta and America airlines.",-1

I wouldn't fly again on Spirit if it was free. The flight out of ATL was the only one close to on time, the other 3 were delayed by one hour or more. Many people missed connections and were not getting helped because it was so late. A 25% on time performance, with out reasonable explanations such as weather, is the #1 reason I will not fly Spirit again. The seats are tolerable for an hour, annoying for hour 2 and downright uncomfortable after 3. The people I interacted with were great but all seemed to have their hands tied by corporate rules. I understand maximizing profit but if they are looking for repeat business, they will not have mine (nor hundreds of others I spoke with stuck in FLL on 2/15). In my 4 hour layover in FLL, I didn't see one flight actually leave on time. Spirit doesn't seem to have customer service in their wheel house. Their check in process is seriously not current, their app sucks and none of the employees have any sense of urgency. While they did get me from point A to point B safely, The time of being late, operating past the normal hours of the airport and their interaction with the airport, I will never subject myself to that again. This is seriously a get what you pay for airline. Expect nothing and you will be happy. If Spirit doesn't get their business model together, it will not be long before they will be exactly that, a spirit from the past.",-1

You are only allowed 1 personal carry on like a small back pack at no cost, Cost us $110 to take 2 carry on bags onto the plane and stow it ourselves in the overhead. And they dont tell you this until your about to go through TSA. You also have to pay for your seats when you check in and pick your seats. That was another 41.00. And all drinks and snacks cost. Coffee 2.00, soda 3.00, chips 2.00.  And the last 30 mins of the flight the attendants are running up and down the aisles pushing their air miles credit card. First time and last time on this airline. Spirit airlines should be ashamed. we never saw anything about these charges when booking. Never again. We could have flown Delta.",-1

Once I forgot my carry on bag on board and the baggage claim staff quickly retrieved it for me. Overall, the fees for beverage, snack and carry on is still a better value than flying with american, delta etc. There are no surprise charges, just customers who expect cheap tickets plus the same free services offered by expensive airlines!

2020-02-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft. Myers,,,,,,1.0,1.0,no compassion or kindness,True,"  Newark to Ft. Myers. The customer service is beyond horrible. the checkin staff and the gate agents are either souless drones or people who are completely unaffected by other humans. My minor daughter was to travel to see her father in another state. She was checked in and 50 minutes before the flight was to depart we attempted to get her boarding pass. the ticket agent could not figure something out. so my daughter showed her phone with the checkin information. She then called to her supervisor who was at the gate. the supervisor was, according to the ticket agent, ""busy"" and didn't want to be interrupted. By now the ticket agent sees how to enter something into her screen and now discovers the flight is closed and boarding started at 1:14 for a 1:59 departure at which time she could no longer print a boarding pass. At this point the ticket agent refused to call her supervisor because she was afraid she'd get fired! Spirit Airlines - what kind of culture do you have that your employees are afraid to call their supervisors to HELP a passenger? Budgte airline or not, your teams should be empowered to provide SERVICE and be KIND. They were rude, unapologetic and unaffected. Your people have no empathy and as a result my daughter was not going to be able to see her father as scheduled. The ticket agent recooked her on a flight the next day, however, that was unnecessary as there was space on the plane that was sitting 150 yards from us and was not scheduled to leave for another 45 minutes. My daughter's time with her dad is limited - i begged the team at the counter for help, but with blank human-less expressions, they they repeated, ""I'm sorry."" with zero conviction and about as much enthusiasm for dealing with customers as someone about to have oral surgery. Spirit airlines employees are zombies with no compassion or kindness. Cancelled flight and booked an out bound on United to get my daughter to her dad as that time that kids have with parents is so precious and limited. Thanks for nothing Spirit. I only gave a rating of 1 because 0 was not permitted.",-1

On my way to Las Vegas I had my carry-on & my purse with no charges. On my way from Las Vegas to Detroit they tried to charge me for my purse. The lady that was organizing the line was very rude. Not to mention our flight attendant. They were wheeling down the cart and the girl next to me was sleeping with her headphones in and she woke her up to tell her ""turn down your music people are trying to sleep.""  I could not hear her music and I was right next to her. Anyone who has flown spirit knows how poor the seats are. Not one person with a Spirit shirt on was friendly nor welcoming.

After we checked bags we went to our gate to find out the flight was delayed by 4 hours! After we wait the 4 hours we find out again that it's delayed another 4 hours. 1 hour after that they come overhead and tell us that flight may not go out today. That part was supposed to be fixed was unable to be and there is not another plane. Assured me that tomorrow that for sure will go. We had tickets to Disney and reservations. They did switch flight into Tampa had to rent a car and drive to Orlando. They also said that we all would get $50.00 vouchers in email, that never happened! So disappointed. Don’t fly Spirit!",-1
2020-02-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando via Richmond,3.0,,5.0,,,2.0,2.0,It was seriously a nightmare,False,"  Orlando via Richmond. The flight to Orlando was ok. The lady who checked us in at Richmond airport was nice and had different expectations of what a carry on consisted in comparison to the lady who checked us in in Orlando for our return flight. My purse, which is an oversized crochet bag had all of our souvenirs in it so it wouldn't mess with their 40 lb weight limit rule. My son and I also added heavier clothes items in my purse and his small carry on because the scales said we were at 45 lbs. In Richmond, we had 40 lbs. So there was actually less in the suitcase. She had an issue with my purse having the souvenirs in it and said it needed to go in the suitcase and we would have to pay $80 instead of $55. I took a few items out and she said that is ok. What?! I paid that for maybe 2 lbs of stuff? We were running behind already with the huge crowd, I'm stressed and crying. I had a horrible stressful incident previously this morning. My bank account had enough to get my son and I home from Richmond and pay the overnight parking fee. She was so inconsiderate, rude, and told me if we miss our flights to come back and purchase another ticket. It was seriously a nightmare. Another thing that is really bothering me, Spirit airline only gives you 10 lbs more .. $50 lbs for $80 is insane!",-1

First, I had received an email at 5 am the day I was suppose to fly, that Spirit were looking for volunteers to change flights. Then I had received a message that my flight is cancelled. Then I receive an email that Spirit has confirmed a flight for me, where I in total have a Layover of 14 hours. 2 hours in FL and 12 hours in ORD. I then borrow a phone and call Spirit to say that it is an unacceptable subelement for the cancelled route. Then Spirit let me on a flight February 3, but don't tell me that they offer a hotel to stay at, as they did to the rest of the passengers which were on the cancelled flight. That is unacceptable.",-1

Arrived to airport early to find flight delayed one hour. Went to gate and checked 2 more times to confirm and sat 2 gates down for a drink. 50 min prior to new time departure we approached the gate to find out from another passenger that the flight had left and she assured me no announcements were made. Approached the gate rep and ""yes, we were able to end up leaving on time""! I have traveled personally and with my job for many years and I have never experienced an airline ""changing their minds and deciding to leave on time"" once a delay has been reflected. There were 3-4 other families left as well. Approached customer service and informed us the only other flight was to fly to Ft Lauderdale after 11pm and then to Orlando arriving after midnight or to take the flight the next day at 11.50. I explained this would not work for us and canceled the flight down only. We were forced to pay an additional $2K with another airline to get our family just to Orlando. On my return flight I approached the counter to find out that I did not have seats on this flight because both legs were canceled. I attempted to explain to the young airline rep who then preceded to put her hand up in my face to tell me to speak with customer service. I have never in my life had such an experience! After speaking with customer service we found flights back but my family paid close to $2,000 for our round trip who was then out another $2,000 due to inconsideration and horrible customer service!",-1

On our return trip from Orlando last Sunday, February 2, my wife was pull apart by a Spirit Airlines counter employee because in addition to her normal size (small) purse, my wife carried the usual free Spirit ""personal Item"" handbag. The problem was not the Spirit luggage policy, it was the manner in which the Spirit employee made her approach to us. My wife told the Spirit employee that she always travels with her purse and the personal item, which by the way meets Spirit's size requirements, but the Spirit employee told us ""if other Spirit employees do not do their job correctly, it was not her problem, that I (employee of Spirit) was going to do mine"". She threatened us and clearly stated that if we did not pay the $65 dollars, we would have to fly with another airline or simply loose our flight. Actually, we simply put the my wife's purse inside the Personal Item bag, and tried to continue, but no, the Spirit employee had us place the bag several times (head on, wheels on, you named it) inside the the Sizing Box, and it did fit! After this Odyssey, we finally continued our trip without having to pay the $65, but with a very bad experience. We will not fly Spirit again! Here we go Southwest!",-1

The only thing he could offer was, a flight departing at 8 PM on 21st May and will land next day at 11:00 AM as if I'm traveling to Dubai, not Denver. He asked me to change dates which I can't do. The only concern I have is I got this ticket at $250 but now if I search it's around $400. They should have canceled or notified me within 2 days so I could get cheaper flight sooner.",-1

The app doesn’t work. I got to airport an hour early only because I had no bags I checked in at the same time I arrived. The app said something about seating so I thought my code would still scan because why else would they give me one. Also it said please see attendant once I checked in. I arrived to an attendant at check-in area after the barcode wouldn’t work at clear around 40 minutes before take off. They wouldn’t help me even though I told them and other people told them their was a glitch in their app. Their line took a 30 minutes to get through. All around the worst airline ever, I fly often but after this I refuse to book with them. I had no bags To check in might I add. So I would’ve easily made it with any other airline. It’s cheap, that’s the only reason I give spirit even two stars, other wise they are horrible based on everything from customer service to they’re hard seats.",-1

Cheap tickets but they charge you for absolutely everything from you baggage to the water you drink. The seats are tiny and made out of hard plastic. They do not recline and theres barely any space to cross your legs. If your trip is more than 2 hours I recommend you pay the extra $50 from the next cheapest airline. In the end you will be spending much more than that and at least flying comfortably.,-1

No in flight entertainment and no WiFi and seats were a little tight, but when you pay 40 dollars for a seat, you get what you pay for. Plane was new, flight was on time, crew was pretty nice. Only thing is bags are more expensive than tickets most of the time and a 40 pound weight limit is frustrating, but as far as the actual flight experience, it was perfect. Recommended for anyone solo who won’t have a lot of stuff. Families might want to look elsewhere though because of the bags prices and limits.",1

So we got to the Chicago airport at 5:30 this morning because we had a family member graduating in the naval forces. We got guest passes to escort him to his flight, so therefore to get passed the gates we went through security. We walked to Spirit terminal and asked the customer service counter if we had to redo security since we paid for checked bags and they assured us we didn’t. Well we get here for our flight and the lady at the desk refuses to give us a pink ticket and says we have to pay for a carry on. Then another worker came over and defended us, calling out the worker for being lazy.",-1

Got an email at 10.30pm notifying the cancellation of my flight the next morning. No reason given. No resolution given except a link which leads to their website. Just their website. Find the customer service number on your own. Finally got on the line with a customer service rep and there was so much yelling in the background it was hard to hear her clearly. The ""best"" she could do was offer me a Sunday night flight when my return flight is Monday morning. Idiots.",-1
2020-01-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,do not choose to fly with Spirit,False,"  Sacramento to Las Vegas. Spirit knew that there was a high probability that the flight would have to be canceled, yet they still had everyone on the flight board the plane anyways, and had us wait for an hour and a half in the seats before telling us that the flight was cancelled. Their reparations were horrible, staff was rude and lied to us, and we had to wait another hour and a half in customer service lines to get refunded. My partner and I were not able to go on our planned weekend trip with family at all. The reason for cancellation was that the bathrooms were broken, and while we were seated they had maintenance frantically trying to fix the bathrooms. Since no one could use the bathrooms while we were waiting for the plane to take off, they had their staff escort patrons on and off the plane to use the bathroom, but wouldn't let anyone buy food, get water or leave. While I was being escorted to the bathrooms, I overheard a Sheriff talking about how there was ""no way this plane would take off tonight"", but whoever was in charge working for Spirit kept arguing with him, clearly trying to evade refunding everyone's flight ... a decision that would cost us all. After having us wait seated on the plane for an hour and a half - which they had passed the time by reassuring us the flight would take off soon, and giving us orders about leaving the plane and using bathrooms - they finally told us the flight was cancelled and to de-board. Everyone got an email with a rescheduled flight - for my partner and I the next flight would be the following night which would not work because our return flight was only a few hours away from our arrival. Since it was so late at night there were not other departing flights for us .. if they had just told us the flight was canceled before having us board we would have made it on another flight and been able to go on our weekend trip. So we In order to get refunded we would have to wait for over an hour in one of Spirit's customer service lines. We asked for compensation for other expenses for having to spend the night at a hotel near the airport or some meal voucher which is customary for airlines refunding canceled flight, but all they offered us was a $50 coupon for a carry-on luggage with Spirit. We declined as we will not be flying with them again. Save yourself a huge risk and do not choose to fly with Spirit. We chose them because we thought it'd be cheap but everyone that night lost more money with Spirit than they would have if they chose a reputable airline.",-1

I have been flying Spirit Airlines once or twice a month for that last year and a half. The airline and customer service has been on a steady descent ever since I started flying with them.

2020-01-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,disrespect and disregard,True,"  San Juan to Fort Lauderdale. Worst customer service ever. I’m stuck in Florida for 24 hours and that’s after I was lied to at the airport and was just stuck on a flight because one set of Spirit employees did not want to mess with the process so they pawned us off to the next airport so they would have to deal with it. Now I’m stuck. Spirit offered me a hotel and $35 in food vouchers.  If you think a hotel and $35 pathetic dollars will help us (2 people) after all this trouble you have caused, you don’t have a clue what customer service is. I have used Spirit 8 times in the last 6 months. I have never been treated with more disrespect from a company than I have when dealing with Spirit Airlines. I never write reviews but I’m at my limit with the disrespect and disregard for taking care of their customers.",-1

It’s true that’s wider and has more leg room, but the seat is unadjustable, which means the back can’t move at all which is extremely uncomfortable. There’s no free carry on or check in, with the money I paid for the carry on luggage, spirit isn’t cheaper than other airlines anymore. There’s literally no service on board, even the water cost 2 dollar. So in conclusion, do not take spirit, it’s not cheaper and it’s extremely uncomfortable.",-1

My family and I were taking a short trip, so each of us packed a book bag, no one had any additional items on them, such as, a purse, suitcase or any bag with wheels and our bags fell within the size limits. We were then pin pointed out and made to pay as if we had each brought a carry on suitcase. When I contacted the airline about it, I was given the same script that our bags were the wrong size, when they did not even ask for a picture to see the bags. There was numerous dogs on our flight, one that had 2 fully grown German Shepard’s that sat directly behind us, she let everyone know that she did not have to pay for her dogs to fly. Her dogs were bigger than the book bag. Again, I just keep getting the run around. This is awful customer service all around. We will never fly with them again, we followed all of the rules and still got charged. Really upsets me that they pick and choose and took advantage of us, knowing we could not argue with in fear of missing our flight.",-1

If you setup a profile you will never be able to login and customer service will only tell you to try again in an hour, but it will never happen. The flight may be cheap but it's only worth it if you have 1 personal item. Otherwise the bag fees are very expensive. And make sure to screenshot your boarding pass because their website and the Spirit app just may not give you the printable version. I think this is done on purpose so you can pay them $10 at the airport for a copy. If you call customer service about it, they will encourage you to print out at the airport. No the seats don't recline so hopefully you get get a long flight and fall asleep on the plane. You will wake up with a crook in your neck and/or possibly aching arms. But if you have only 1 bag 18x14x8 then you're cool.",-1

My first flight was delayed for 1 hour at first, then for another 30 minutes. When we got to Detroit, we were late to our next flight. Took us another 40 minutes to get our luggage. The next flight was already almost boarded. No one seemed to accommodate as somehow or at least to apologize. After we stuck in security area and my tray was just sitting for an additional check, I tried to ask the lady at the boarding area to wait for a little, because we were still getting checked, since it was just across from that area. The lady responded with attitude, that she is going to close the gate now. I went back to security and asked if they could check my tray please, but got another mean worker to tell me NO! n I went back to the boarding area and asked if I can just stay there. And lady said that I had to have my boarding passes, which were kept by my husband who was still at security point So stressful for me and my child and the whole family. I wasn’t disrespectful or didn’t say anything I shouldn’t say. Just trying to explain it wasn’t my fault. The lady called security on me and said she wouldn’t let me on a plane. She made up story that I was calling her names. And when I asked for her name - she refused to give me her name , just laughed and said to look for her on FB. They left us on empty airport for more than 7 hours without offering any food or place to rest. Now we have to fly to Vegas in AM and then to LA. I still don’t know where to look for my luggage. It’s my last time using Spirit airlines.",-1
2020-01-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Houston,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,Checked baggage twice as expensive,True," Denver to Houston. I never fly Spirit Airline, but due to a Travel Agency Mixup With my travel date, “I thought” this option would be a cheaper option. I could not have been more mistaken. Checked baggage is twice as expensive as other airlines. This did not bother me as much as them misplacing my snowboard and gear. The not only misplaced mine but the misplaced a fellow passengers car seat. The missing baggage report was simple enough while at the airport. But their follow up is less than poor. It is near impossible to talk with an actual person over the telephone. Their automated is suboptimal. It gives you number options but does not recognize the response when pressed, then hangs up on you. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt by using a landline and the same thing happened. The good news is that the board and gear were found. The bad news is they made no effort to inform me when it was found. I had to spend 2 hours on hold to actually find out where my bag was. Then had to drive back, 30 miles, and pay for parking, then track down someone who could find my bag. Spirit does not have special handling for items such as Snow Boards. I recommend United or American Airlines for these types of item. They do a fantastic job. Not once in over 50 travels have either of these items lost my gear.",-1

The large front seats I booked 3 months in advance were overbooked and we were booted to $0 seats in the back of the plane. We called customer service about the change in seats the day before the flight. It was then we were informed that the seats were overbooked and that a refund had already been issued to our credit card but it would be 7-10 days before we saw the refund. 17 days after the refund was supposedly sent we still had not received anything. After wasting another hour on the phone with customer service we still do not have our refund. The customer service agent and the supervisor both told us to speak to our bank. Eventually we discovered the refund was supposedly sent to the reward program we used to purchase the tickets approx 2 weeks before we purchased the seats and baggage with our credit card. We were then told to contact the reward program to get our money back from them. This company is so sketchy that they actually tell their customers to go to a third party to try to “fix” the mistakes the company made. Never use Spirit Airlines!,-1

I bought a ticket through spirit & later that day realized a needed to add my 12 y/o brother to my flight. I went online to book his flight also & it wouldn’t allow me since my flight was bought already and it appeared as though he was an “unaccompanied minor”. I can understand this so I decided to just call (what a joke) and speak with someone who could assist me with this. I called the day I bought the ticket, wait time too long & the auto system hung up on me. I thought it was a fluke so I called back again & same thing. I called the next day & still “extremely long hold times” without even giving me the option to choose to hold it hung up on me. I called again today 01/09/20 and finally got through to someone. She said she could assist me and continued to quote me a price FOUR times what I paid for mine because “flight prices vary and I should have done it two days ago” I tried multiple time to do it two days ago with no success. I did my part by trying to contact them over and over again to no avail and I told the representative that and explained that I should be allowed the price that I paid the day I tried to contact them originally. I can provide phone records , I can provide proof that I tried their circus of a texting assistance program, but still she says NO I cannot help you.

For a family of four (two adults and two kids under 12), we saved close to $1000 as compared to flying with Southwest, which is our usual go to airline. Our flight leaving BWI was thirty minutes late and 50 minutes late leaving Montego Bay, although I think that was partly due to the disorganization at the Jamaica airport and not necessarily the airline. Even with the late departures, my opinion is, who cares? I'm saving a lot of money. No free drinks or snacks but you can bring this stuff with you. There is no wifi either but we downloaded movies on our Ipads for the kids so they were fine. We checked two bags at the gate, which were $45 a piece. We each brought a backpack which is considered a personal bag, not a carry-on, so there was no additional charge. The staff were friendly and professional. I'd definitely fly with them again.",1

I had a personal item That I measured as instructed when I purchased my ticket. My friend who also was on this flight had the exact personal item as me and didn’t pay luggage and didn’t get Charged before entering TSA. i Had to pay $ 55 for a bookbag. After paying the $ 55.00 for the personal item I truly believe it was not right.  A supervisor was approached with this complaint by my family member who was not Flying. The supervisor said one moment I am going to go to the terminal to check in a moment. The moment turned into almost 25 minutes and at that point the airplane departed and he was unable to double check our dispute with the physical bag. The rudeness of this supervisor was beyond believe after making my family member wait for nothing. I will never travel with this airline again the price is cheap but their customer service is cheaper. They are unprofessional and disrespectful.,-1

The local clinic said he was contagious and should not fly. I rearranged my flight for a day later. I was charged the full amount for new flights. I contacted Spirit Airlines and they would not refund or provide a future travel voucher! They preferred that we get on the plane and infect their 200 plus passengers! I will never fly this irresponsible airline if that is how they feel about the passengers.,-1

It is famous for being cheap but the quality and service are extremely poor. The seats are not adjustable. You have only one position from taking off to en-route flying. I guess that's how they can pack more people to make the price looks cheaper but very uncomfortable during flying. You think that you got good deal for the lower ticket price but they will get their money back with surprise charges that all other airlines will provide for free. There is no free drink and snack service even for long flight. They charge from $3.00 for a bottle of drinking water up to $65.00 for standard carry on luggage bag that will be free for all other airlines. I lessons learnt is never fly Spirit Airlines again.,-1

I have never ever been charged for a carry on bag, $50 really? And the checked bag cost $55.00 for a grand total of $105 for my baggage. That is highway robbery. Then to make matters worse as if it could get any worse, you have to pay for a beverage or snack. What, really? Spirit Airlines should be ashamed of themselves. You will neverhave me for a customer. They draw you in with the cheap airfare, but then charge you an arm and a leg for everything else.",-1

Found out needed to pay for Carry on and informed them again Military and they didn't charge me for that carry on. Said I get 2 checked bags and one carry on for free. Cannot get a hold of anyone to get refund for the extra we paid for checked bags. Seems to look cheaper at first but after all the nickel and dime rubbish it is not! This was our first flight as a family and I am sure if I purchased directly from the airline it would have been the same. This experience was terrible!,-1

I have flown Spirit now for a total of 6 trips of which 3 of the 6 were canceled or I was bumped or lied to about my ticket even existing and unnecessarily had to buy an additional ticket, hotel stay because of the complete dishonesty and overbooked flights on the planet! All on purpose with no recourse other than a nightmare website and incompetent call center with hold times of over an hour to try and settle any dispute that is completely Spirit Airlines fault! I have spent hundreds and hundreds of extra ticket costs along with missing work due to the incompetent customer service operator and lack of trust in this airline for the remainder of my life. Spirit Airlines overbooks flights at low prices and then will bump or cancel or lie about your flight without reason or recourse to make it right or refund your money. The lines are a zoo at the airport because of this and it always a nightmare to get through security anywhere near the Spirit Airline gates/terminals!",-1

There was a 2 hour delay for rain, and I kind of understood but the other airlines had no delays. What was bad about the whole think is they didnt communicate any of the changes and if you asked any questions they made you feel like you was bothering them. They are clearly not a professional airline. I flew American on the way down and had no issues. Very understaffed at the customer service where you check in, you are more less on your own, I asked one person for help leaving fort Lauderdale airport he told me to read the signs and seemed very upset I asked him a question. Next trip I will reconsider using spirit again. It's cheap but not worth it.",-1

I started to have second thoughts about the trip due to concerns about the covid-19 virus and contacted them on Monday March 2nd to discuss options. They indicated I could cancel then and receive a full refund. I asked them when was the deadline for a partial cash refund and was told I could receive a partial refund up to 7 days before the flight. I attempted to cancel my reservation this morning March 4th and was told I could only get a airline credit. I was lied to. The $667.00 dollars is a small, so I'm willing to eat that, since I really have no other choice. Please be aware of deceptive statements and written polices when thinking about flying discount carries like Spirit Airlines. Stick to major carriers if you can afford it. There was a $200 dollars differences between Spirit Airline fare and American Airlines fare. Based on my experience with Spirit Airlines, that $200 dollars would have been well spent.",-1

The staff don’t care about helping their customers, and this airline allowed people to book a flight when they knew it was going to be a problem when we get to Ft Lauderdale. We got there approximately 6:00 AM and customs held us for an hour and let JetBlue customers in front of us because according to them they have face recognition. We should get treated equally, we all pay to get here and many flyers are American so why get treated different. The customs agent was so rude, was yelling at people as if we were whole bunch ignorants, that was uncalled for. What bothers me about Spirit staff is that they did not bother to let us know we were going to miss our connection flight. I had my vehicle in FL, that had book a parking until 11:30 AM and I was told that the next available flight would be at midnight, I couldn’t wait that long because, one because I had to pick up my vehicle and second I had to drive to another state, and be at work the next day so I had to rent a vehicle drive to Orlando because this careless airline. I hope flyers find this useful, because what you think you are going to save you don’t save anything flying with them, this airline charge for everything and on top is the worst airline I have fly with.",-1

After buying transportation by air, ended up that had to spend another 4 hours to get home by bus, because the next flight that they could offer wouldn’t be until 12 hours, and who was there to assure that another delay wouldn’t happen again. None of the employees showed any compassion or empathy,offering at least an apology, not to expect a cup of water. Spirit Airlines is an expensive airline with chip services.

I was apprehensive because of the reviews I read all over the internet. Our experience was near perfect. Easy online check in, family seating together (5 of us) without buying seats. We were helped at the kiosk to get our boarding passes and bag tags with very pleasant and patient staff. Both our flights left on time and arrived early both ways. Which was the only issue I guess because we had to wait on the tarmac for about 30 minutes until our supposed arrival time. Not a big deal. The planes both ways were clean, comfortable, for a 3-4 hour flight. We travel light so our day backpack were our personal items, no extra charge and we checked just 1 bag for our family of 5. Will travel again with spirit.",1

Worst airline experience I’ve ever had by far. You will be lured in by the cheap prices, I promise you they are not worth it in comparison to what you will have to pay out of pocket if your flight gets cancelled. My flight was first delayed 3 hours, then cancelled all together, both without any explanation. Options were to rebook 3 days later or take the $175 flight credit. I ended up paying $400 out of pocket to get home the next day from southwest out of Dulles so that voucher covered very little of the $565 flight.

I travelled with my family, my son and I had only backpacks and my wife had a ladies handbag and a 21” carry-on luggage which is a pretty standard size for every other airline in the world. At the gate, the flight attendant asked us pay $65 just for the ladies handbag as he couldn’t say anything about the carry-on size. Although we explained, they were rude and they managed some other travelers in the same manner. I would strongly recommend to avoid Sprit Airlines hereafter and would like to give 0 stars for their attitude. Since there is no option, I’m giving 1 star.

2019-12-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Baltimore Washington,,,,,,1.0,1.0,cannot issue a refund,True,"  Atlanta to Baltimore Washington. I recently lost my mother and needed an emergency ticket home for her service. I went with Spirit because it was the last minute and the pricing didn't put me in a place where I couldn't contribute to the funeral services. Booked my flight and arrived at the airport about 50 minutes before departure due to traffic, but I still had enough time to make it. I go to check the check-in counter to check-in and the guest service agent doesn't check my confirmation number, just knows my destination and tells me that I wouldn't make the flight. Panicked and obviously sad that I may miss the funeral, I purchase another ticket from American Airlines. Long story short, I missed my mother's funeral. It wasn't until I checked my email before getting on the 2nd flight that I realized that Spirit notified me of my initial flight's delay after the plane took off. My flight was scheduled for 6:59 pm, It was delayed until 7:29 pm but I was not notified until 7:37 pm. I called Spirit for a refund or a credit and they said since the flight was not delayed greater than 2 hours and the notification was provided, we cannot issue a refund.",-1
2019-12-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,extremely unhappy,True,"  Tampa to Nashville. I booked large seats with more legroom almost 3 months in advance of my flight. There are 8 of these seats per flight, 6 were available when I booked. When I checked into my flight 24 hours before the flight our seats were switched from the row 2 large seats to row 25 crammed into the window and middle seats. I have knee problems and can not sit for long periods without stretching, therefore flying in the middle or window seat in an economy plane with no legroom for a 2-hour flight is a nightmare and will leave me unable to stand or walk. When Spirit was called they stated they noticed that the seats were double booked 2 days before the flight (almost 3 months after being paid in full) and had sent a refund to our card that we should see in approx 7 days. We were given no notification and they couldn’t tell us how much of a credit they gave us so we don’t even know if we were given full credit for what we paid. The Spirit agent was asked how many of the large seats were booked after my booking. She stated she could not answer. I was given no resolution to the problem other than “we sent you a refund for the extra price of the seats“. This is nowhere near adequate customer service. We escalated the call to a ”manager” who also had no resolution or even an offer to try to make things better. He eventually moved our seats closer to our son but we are still in small seats at the window and the middle. I am extremely unhappy with my experience and the lack of the so called customer service agent to do anything to try to improve it. This is either incompetence to the extreme or a company that will not allow their customer service any autonomy to be able to at least somewhat satisfy their customers so they can have repeat business. They definitely will not have my business or anyone I talk to.",-1

This is simply the worst flying experience I have ever had. I'm not even sure where to begin. The ticket was a gift from a family friend given to me in order to meet them in Costa Rica from NYC. It took forever to check in - 40 min after waiting for a kiosk. The kiosk terminal stopped working on me twice. Then out pilot never showed up! After waiting hours in agent lines 40 of us were stuck on Orlando for the night. I got to the airport at 5AM for. 740 flight. They ended up having me in a hotel 9pm that night in order to catch a flight the next morning. All the agents were powerless. My knees and feet were in pain from standing at the agent line on order to get to my destination. I felt like these guys might even be running some kind of Ponzi scheme or something. They left so many people stranded. I lost a full day of my hotel and vacation. I just don't even understand how this whole procedure is legal. There must be some travelers bill of rights that these people should adhere too. I could right a book on how bad the experience was. The agents were really nice and tried to help. But there computers were super slow. And everyone seemed powerless to try to help.,-1

Our flight was supposed to fly on 23rd 8:12 PM and was cancelled after we finished security checking. Staff at the gate for boarding had no idea that the flight was cancelled. We saw on board and informed them, no reason what so ever given. Later we were put on to 24th 9:12 flight, we recieved no compensation. This was no end to this agony, 9:12 flight was delayed to 1:16 PM. And again to 2:30 PM. At 11:30 AM it was again delayed to 3:16 PM. Still, no reason given. We have still not boarded the plane, writing this review while waiting on the mercy of the airline, not sure if we ever board the flight. No reasoning given, this money sucker airline charges for every tiny thing possible. This is my first flight would them and would be last. So you want to plan your vacation never ever book with this non-ethical airline. We already lost our 2 days of vacation sitting at the airport and not sure what is coming in future. Not sure how this airline is even allowed its operations. While writing this review, again it's delayed from 3:16 PM to 3:22PM.

Flight was scheduled to depart at 9.45am. at 9 am crew announced there was some maintenance issue and flight is delayed. After a while they got an update saying it is mechanical problem and new ETD is 1.37 pm. Nobody had any clue what is happening. When we asked for status, crew kept saying ETD is 1.37 pm, even at 2.30 pm! They did not offer any other arrangement, could not guarantee seat on next day flights. Waited for an hour in line to get refund, that time they pushed flight ETD to midnight. For a while their system was not allowing ticket refunds either. Finally got my flight ticket refunded (still to receive money), scheduled flight next day with other, better airline. I received status update that flight is cancelled at 6pm~, roughly 9 hours after scheduled flight. There were many people in line who wanted to visit home for Christmas, traveling to Houston, but could not afford last min tickets for 1000$+.

2019-12-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2.0,last straw to never flying them again,True," This is a review of a flight that never took place. We were scheduled to fly from Orlando to Philadelphia on Spirit. Before we arrived at the airport we got a notification that the flight was delayed. Okay, thanks for telling us. The delays continued to increase and the gate was reassigned at the airport (with no indication at the gate that it was at the new gate) and finally, the flight was cancelled and we were instructed to go back to the ticket counter on the other side of security. I literally ran at that point and was glad that I did. We got to an agent relatively quickly and were glad that we did as it took no less than 40 minutes to get us on a flight the next morning (while people we were ahead of in line got a flight that night) and a hotel and meal vouchers at the airport which were kind of useless if we were going to the hotel. A line of more than 200 gathered behind us while up to 5 agents gathered seemingly mystified by what the system was doing, etc. All the while the lack of concern on the part of the Customer Service personnel was shocking. Spirit is certainly cheap but I'm unsure if I've ever flown them when they haven't been delayed to some degree. This experience might well be the proverbial last straw to never flying them again.",-1

I flew with this company from Orlando to Houston, with my wife and son. The flight delayed 2 hours from Orlando to Houston, which caused me to miss some appointments there. On returning to Orlando, guess what, the flight was delayed again. I ran to be at the airport at the scheduled time but, with 5 minutes to boarding, I received the information that the flight was delayed and would only take off 1 hour later. Spirit never again.",-1
2019-12-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,charged $55 for the carry-on,True,"  I hadn't heard of this airline prior to booking my ticket on AAA.com. When I was comparing prices it didn't indicate any additional charges for bags, etc. Since I have a small carry-bag I didn't need to check any bags.  I booked my ticket 3 months in advance and could have flown Delta for about $50 more. So I figured I give Spirit a try. I was unable to print boarding pass until 24 hours before the flight, when I did, that's when I saw that they charge for seats and carry-on. I was shocked that they charged $55 for the carry-on. I paid it in Tampa & then learned on my return flight that it was only for one way and had to pay $50 for the return flight. When I was on the flight I asked for some water to take Tylenol and was told they charge $3 for water and said they couldn't give me any water. I was put in the middle seat when I had requested an aisle seat. While flying they hawked their credit card and other Spirit merchandise. The seating was very small, I'm a small woman, but was very crammed into the seat. I will never fly this airline again & suggest no one else does either. By the time they add on all the extra charges, its cheaper to fly Delta.",-1
2019-12-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Austin,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,False,"  My family will never fly this airline again! First encounter, they was so slow at getting passengers through the ticketing area that we +20 families missed our flights. The next day we was delayed 5 hours to finally get to our destination. And today, my husband is coming back from Cancun and they wouldn’t let him use my debit card for his bags that he is authorized to use. I had to call customer service and what really annoyed me is when they said that he would pay more if he gets his boarding pass from the ticketing counter! That’s outrageous! I only chose that airline because that was the only one that had a decent layover. But this is the final straw and I will just pay the extra money for travel because they’re too cheap to actually hire more worker or pay for them to have adequate customer service.",-1
2019-12-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,one I’ll never forget,True,"  I tried to establish a way around blasting Spirit on social media, but their customer service is as inept as their business model is a failure. Of my 5,000+ flights, this was the worst and one I’ll never forget. I’d give a negative rating if I could. I boarded flight 403 with service from LAX-FLL last week with a quick layover in Atlanta. The boarding process went smoothly, but a few minutes in the pilot notified us and said they detected a leak, which means it’ll be slightly delayed while they investigate. No big deal, right? Wrong. We continued to receive texts about the delay lasting longer and longer. The flight was connected to the jetway, but the captain told us over the loud speaker, “sorry folks, if I allow you to disembark it could cause a further delay if you get food or lost in the terminal. For that reason, you cannot get off the plane.” The delay lasted 4 hours. The cabin did not have air conditioning. We were all drenched in sweat, fanning ourselves, in absolute misery. We were not offered any food, water, or any explanation as to why they wouldn’t even let us purchase water on the plane! We were forced to stay on this flight all while we were connected to the jetway! If they let us off the plane, we could have at least purchased items, but they would not serve us anything. Once we were airborne, the flight attendants gave us stale biscotti cookies that looked like dust. Oh yeah, with no water. It was inhumane. As you can imagine, tempers among the passengers flared, and instead of being professional, the flight attendants were just as nasty back. I could not believe what I saw that day. I have never experienced anything like this, and I’ve never seen flight attendants so nasty. After 10 hours of travel time, you can imagine the pain I was in from their terrible metal seats. I immediately contacted the airline demanding a refund. First of all, they tried to offer a $50 FFV. Do you think I’m insane and would fly you again? Second, they accused me of lying and that passengers were deplaning hanging out in the terminal. Funny, my video contradicts the statement they gave. Fortunately, I have proof of the captain making the announcement I described above. Spirit asked me to send it to them, which I did not oblige as it could be tampered with or altered to benefit them. I also have videos with passengers fanning themselves and nearly in a heat stroke as we were kept hostage on the flight. We were in miserable conditions, and it could have caused an emergency. I tried to be respectful and handle this privately, but you guys have left me no choice to take it to the next level. Your handling of this shows me you do not care about our wellbeing or safety. To anyone who reads this, do not fly Spirit. They treat their passengers worse than animals. I only chose the airline because I had a quick meeting. It was cheap and I got what I paid for. I have flown nearly 300K miles in my young life, and I fly three times a month. With that said, there is nothing worse than their product. You actually spend more money than other airlines when you factor in bags, water, pain in your back, etc. Spend the extra couple dollars on a real airline and don’t be cheap. I will never fly you again.",-1

We missed our connecting flight because the first plane was delayed to take off. The agent told us that since it was due to bad weather, they were not responsible to help us out. All Burbank flights same day were either full or not available to us. We absolutely had to be back home that day. Both my husband and I lost a full day of work that cost us a lot of money and stress. In the end, when we realized that no help could be reached from Spirit Airlines, we ended up renting a car and driving ourselves from Las Vegas to Burbank, extending our trip by another 10 hours. We were exhausted and unsatisfied. I just never knew that bad weather is somehow the passengers fault. Never flying with them again.",-1

I have been given the run around and offered no assistance in locating my bag only been told ""good luck in finding it"".

I approached the staff at the gate if I could change my seat by the isle because I have a bladder issue that I need to constantly use the bathroom. The lady said we charge extra for that and I said I heard flight is not full can you just make accommodations since I already paid almost a hundred on my luggage. She gave me the smirk and look of disgust and rolled her eyeball. I decided to sit down and ignore her. They charge very high for checked in luggage with the lowest weight allowed. Very strict on the size of personal item and will charged carry on bag. They keep announcing too that they do charge for carry on bags.  They charge $43 for 40 lbs and god forbid you went a pound over then they charge you $30 more.  And one of the flight attendant is so loud and she talked the whole trip where everyone in the airplane can hear her. I finally had enough of her and told her to shush she should know better she works there and everyone’s asleep. But she ignored me and continued to talk. I will never fly again with spirit air. Worst service, worst staff, worst airline.",-1

My family and I flew on Spirit Airlines this past July. Upon returning to the U.S. my husband became critically ill and had to be transported to the hospital there in Ft Lauderdale upon landing where he passed away two days later. The day he died all we wanted to do was get home to Dallas where we could be alone with our grief. So we called Spirit and explained the situation and told them that when my husband got sick upon landing we were not able to make our connecting flight to Dallas but all we wanted to do was go home that day. Customer service did not even say they were sorry for our loss or work with us to try and get us home. We will never fly Spirit again. We called Southwest and they were so kind to us and got us on the next plane to Dallas. When we arrived at Southwest ticket counter the ticket agent even pre boarded us and came out from behind the counter and cried with us. That’s good customer service Spirit! Southwest has you beat.",-1

Originally set to depart at 7:30am is now not set to depart until 1:12pm. We are now missing our board time for our cruise. This was our Christmas gift to the kids. Thank you Spirit Airline.

2019-12-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Charlotte,1.0,,2.0,,,3.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,  Newark to Charlotte. Spirit Airlines is no-frills no food no drink no wifi with the understanding that it is less expensive. As it turns out that is false unless you travel with no assigned seat and NO luggage only a purse or backpack. If you even bring a small carry on it is going to cost $$$. Will never fly this airline again as it turned out to be more than others after all the hidden fees. The carry on cost more than to check a bag and if you wait until you get to the air port it cost even more for the same item. Not sure why as you have to hand your bag to the ticket agent anyway!,-1
2019-12-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"draining, strenuous, and costly experience",False,"  A very draining, strenuous, and costly experience. I booked a flight 11-28-19 from Nashville (BNA) to Los Angeles (LAX) for my son’s 6th birthday on the 29th. I checked in Nov. 28th Thanksgiving night to the Nashville (BNA) airport in route to Los Angeles (LAX) and checked in my bag for $55 at the Spirit terminal. I booked through Spirit airline from Nashville (departure 9:48pm) to LA, with a layover in Las Vegas (arrival 11:59pm 11-28-19) then from Las Vegas (departure 9:12am) arriving at LAX (10:31am ). Upon arriving to LAX I realized my bag was not there. I immediately went to Spirit baggage claims to check and the representative was very helpful in an attempt to find the bag. However, after several attempts to contact the Vegas terminal I was informed to contact baggage claim or corporate within 24 hours or I will be contacted if/when the bag is located and given a claim number. I was informed that the bag could possibly arrive upon the next couple Vegas arriving flights at later times in the day.  I had to extend my stay close to the airport until 12-03-19. This now plays a role into my finances that were not expected. I'm now filing this after officially the fifth day as I was instructed to. Not once I have received a phone call nor email in regards to my bag nor update. I've filled out the property form of all my belongings, unexpected expenses due to situation (extended hotel stay $144.00 for two nights). Due to the troubles I was offered a $50 voucher for a future flight. Once I decided to return back home I booked a flight online, but could not apply the voucher. I was told based on the flight being with two different airlines (American Airline from LA to Vegas, then Spirit from Vegas to Nashville) that the voucher could not be used. Once I booked the flight for 12-3-19 from LA to Nashville, it was set for departure from LAX at 4:30pm then connect in Vegas and departure to Nashville at 11:59pm. During the night I received and email of flight change. The 4:30pm departure had been set back to 9:30pm, with the same layover and departure for Spirit from Vegas to Nashville being at 11:59pm. Upon arrival to the departure gate the flight was delayed til 10:30pm. Once this was announced I immediately contacted a Spirit representative to inform me that I would be arriving at the Vegas airport with a short period of time to get to the departure gate for Nashville and could the notify the airline. The representative said she would. Once I arrived I immediately ran towards the gate in which happen to be completely on the other side of the airport. I arrived at the departure gate within ten minutes of the actually departure time and the plane was still locked into the port. No one was a the gate to help.",-1

I asked to escort my 82 year old grandma because she doesn’t know how to get the the gate nor get on the plane. The employee said that was not possible because they do not have that service. So we got the wheelchair service. I asked the employee who was checking her in, if that person was going to take her onto the plane and if she would also get that service to her arrival, so she wouldn’t get lost, and she said yes! Later on, received a call that my grandma had lost her flight because she had wandered off! That the wheelchair service person said they just sat her down and left her there. When talking to the supervisor she said that the wheelchair only takes her to the gate that we should have had a family member escort her. From the beginning I asked for that and they said they do not offer that. It is ridiculous how employees are not trained enough to know this type of information, and for the wheelchair assistance to have at least some common sense. Why would you leave an 82 year old women alone. This is not her first time flying in Spirit Airlines and we always had the wheelchair assistance and this was never an issue before. Spirit Airlines should definitely train their employees and also the wheelchair service employees.",-1

You have to give up all basic conveniences and amenities. This airline also calls Final Call at gates if they have ""most"" of the passengers boarded. They called final call at 8:39am on a 9:09am departure time. We then sat in the airplane until 9:07am before we left the gate. Terrible and misleading communication. Poor customer service. If you must fly Spirit, due to economic reasons outside your control, make sure you dont need to take any bags (just a personal item/purse) and the flight is less than 90min long. Only then can it be worth it.",-1

I received notification less than 24 hours out that my flight itinerary was changed. I logged into the website and the new flight was 12 hours different and didn't work with my travel schedule. I attempted to call the airline and got a busy signal repeatedly (guessing they were experiencing high call volume). I couldn't get an acceptable change online so I immediately booked another carrier because I had less than 24 hours until I needed to travel and available flights were becoming limited. I later learned that my original flight was again available. Since I had already replaced my flight with another carrier I attempted to cancel my Spirit flight. I was offered $10 credit and no refund. I finally got a hold of customer service and explained the situation and they refused to offer me anything other than the $10 credit and no refund. They said it was an error via their website and the original flight was never changed so any change or cancellation was voluntary and not subject to a refund. The only reason I replaced my ticket with another carrier was because of their communication that my flight was cancelled and my inability to get a hold of anyone by telephone immediately. They simply did not care. Will never book this airline again and will obviously share this info with anyone willing to listen.,-1

Arrive back to the ticket station at that time and then was told had to wait another 45 min before could take my bags. My issues comes with being told misinformation from the start and still having to wait when i have already had to wait 4 hrs since my cruise ship was moving fast to let the airport people off so they wouldn’t be pushing for time.

Now is not okay because the wheels can't fit into that little spot you call for a personal item? I can understand charging maybe 25 dollars like other airlines for a carry-on bag, but just last year it was 50 dollars only. Even for a flight that I'd booked a month out this flight wasn't even cheaper than normal to justify such a charge. The only reason I'd taken this airline was because the dates worked out with my work schedule. Never again, I'm going to book even earlier to avoid this cash-grab of a company. The only thing was, even though I was mad the women who took care of me let me be in Zone 1 when boarding.

Mind you, this was not mentioned on my first leg (LGA-FLL) otherwise I would have had to pay that leg too. When I then looked at the departure time screens the flight was delayed by two hours. This was later wordlessly rescinded and my flight times were magically returned to their original times, leading me to have to hurry through security. Lastly, this was a rebooked flight after my initial flight in August was canceled. For this rebooking I was forced to pay a fee of $180 which I was told to contest (and escalate to a manager on advice or a Spirit employee!!). I understand the business of LCCs is to charge extra on several factors, but this company seems to depend on subterfuge and lies in order to make a buck.",-1

My 85-year-old mother was injured after a fellow passenger dropped a piece of luggage from the overhead bin on her at FLL after landing. Although she sustained injuries to her head and chest, no airport security or medical staff were called on-board to take a report or check her out. She had to walk off the plane under her own power and then be placed in a wheelchair. Meantime, the man that dropped the luggage was allowed to leave the plane without any questioning, obtaining any information, name, etc. Spirit airline employees seemed at a loss as to what should be done, even after we requested that medical and security personnel be brought on board to check her out and investigate. Although Spirit employees seemed to show some concern, they seemed more interested in keeping the incident quiet and even had my mother move to the rear of the plane to help keep this private.

When I pushed the button for help, I got chastised on the loud speaker. The attendant did come back and say to them, “you know I have my eye on you. Do the right thing,” but they continued their poor and unsafe behavior for the remainder of the flight. I taped their conduct and later showed the attendants.

Worst of the worst which you may not realize unless/until you have a problem, one you can walk away from, I mean. They charge extra even for water, not to mention any kind of carry-on bag bigger than a purse--and then an extra fee for the airport agent to put the tag on your bag, also extra for the right to pick the seat you're buying (and none of them reclines at all), and a hefty fee for the opportunity to change your flight once only. Forget communicating with their underpaid and overworked staff. I waited on hold more than an hour twice, then tried to chat but was told: ""go on about your day, we'll get back to you when we can."" Then, I even drove to the airport to make the one change I paid for and to implement the change, they insisted on charging me double for a seat I'd already paid for. The airport staff claimed they had no authority to do anything else and the ""customer service"" crew (online, of course) said they couldn't refund the doublecharge because it was ""not consistent with our management's guidelines.""

This airline is a complete rip-off. First-time customer my first experience completely turned off from being a continued customer. Staff is rude and very unprofessional. Not dressed in proper uniform. Customer service is awful. I was charge $65 for a carry on bag under the required measured size. I was not charged for when flown in on the flight to the destination. Now I’m being charged for my return home. Seats are uncomfortable. Unorganized. Dirty airplane found gum stuck to my seat. Paid extra for shortcut security line $7.00, had to wait in a longer line. Paid extra $5.99 for shortcut boarding still had to wait for zone 3. I expect a full refund for the service I paid for but did not receive.

The flight was delayed 2 hours and then everyone on the plane was offered something to drink except her. She landed and I was so upset. The least you could have done was offered her some water and the extra $110 dollars for us nothing. I will never fly Spirit again and make sure everyone I know will hear the same thing.,-1

I flew to Chicago and then my return flight was cancelled. the only thing spirit was willing to offer me was a return of only about 2/3 of the cost of my ticket or a replacement ticket 3 days later. They did not offer to pay for my accommodations while stuck in Chicago for three days or anything I was simply stranded and had to pay more then twice the amount they promised to refund me to return to Los Angeles. Now I have discovered that they never returned the measly 150 dollars they said they would pay me after spending two hours on the phone waiting to speak with a manager.,-1

Told us we needed to deboard the plane on a 1 stop (msp) flight from Baltimore to Denver due to change of flight crew. Once off the flight the said it was canceled due to mechanical. Then when they started to rebook us they said we were canceled due to weather. Funny all the other airlines are still flying in and out of Denver. Of course if they say it is weather they do not have to accommodate us like they do if it is mechanical. Cant rebook us until the morning. No offers of hotels, no food vouchers. Nothing. Wont book us on the airlines that are flying. Wont help with our luggage. I rebooked with frontier and am flying out later this evening. Went for my refund and it will be 7-14 days for it to be processed. Funny their cancellation was immediate but returning my money is not. First and only flight with this airline. I will never fly them again.",-1

I booked my flight based on when my ride could get me to the airport and I should have gone the usual route with United or Alaska or American, but I tried Spirit. They took my money for the flight but when it came time to pay for my bags it was a super hassle. I had to call three separate days trying to pay a huge fee for two bags. Those two bags never made them to the destination. Customer service was no help what so ever and when I asked to talk to a supervisor I was hung up on twice after waiting on hold for thirty mins each time. Customer service basically blamed the inter website the other carriers and took no responsibility for any on it. When I arrived Honolulu neither of the two bags that I paid $100 to have them checked in never arrived. Now they are in Las Vegas or Chicago and there is no one available to tell me where and when I can have them put on the correct plane to the original destination. Worst airline experience ever. There was also a rat in the gate in Chicago . Flight left late bc another Spirit flight was delayed . And I almost missed my connecting flight in a different terminal. Never again. I recommend you never doing it either. I should have read any of the horrible reviews before pulling the trigger on the ticket. But no refunds etc kept me stuck with these losers.",-1
2019-10-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly with Spirit again,True,"  Boston to Myrtle Beach. I take all of my trips flying Spirit with no problems at all. This year alone, I’ve flown to New Orleans in March and to Boston in June and in October. I’ve always had a decent experience. Except my most recent trip. As my personal item, I always take my small, black Hurley duffel bag with no problem at all. A lady working up front, questioned my bag. The bag looked bulky, I had just spent 3 days in my hometown, gifts for everyone! I look at her confused reassuring her that I always use this bag when flying with them. She told me to fit it in the tray and if it fits to get back in line. Of course, I fit it inside the personal item tray and get back into line. Again, she questions me and I explain to her I just did it and it fits. She looks at me as if I was lying and said a carry on is $65. I refused to pay. I spoke with the supervisor who was not accommodating whatsoever. I explained to her how often I have traveled with you guys and have never had a problem with my personal item. With lots of attitude, the supervisor and the lady working up front turn to each other in which they start bad mouthing me in Spanish, not aware that I am Hispanic and can understand them. This made me extremely upset, I tell them that I’m fully aware of their conversation. I cannot believe it. The supervisor even threatened me saying she would remove me from the flight if I didn’t cooperate. After this awful experience, I will never fly with Spirit again. The prices are great, however the customer service and accommodation to frequent flyers is poor. I cannot believe this was my experience before a 5AM flight. I would not recommend to others, and I will take my business elsewhere. I even filed a complaint in which they did not grant me a refund. Ridiculous. Cheap airline with no accommodation. Pay the extra and fly elsewhere. Trust me, it’s not worth it.",-1

My bag was paid for and checked. my flight landed on Monday. I unpacked my belongs on Tuesday. During that time I noticed that my bag of souvenirs were missing. Before checking my bag, I spent almost $150.00 in the gift shop buying things for my family and friends. The entire bag was stolen out of my checked bag. I called Spirit to file a report and was told that their policy is ""all reports must be made within four hours!"" I've taken several flights and I've never unpacked my bag within four hour of landing. I would have been happy with the agent taking the information and making a record that things go ""missing"" while the bags are checked. There policy is unacceptable and their workers should not go into peoples bags. I will not take another flight with Spirit again",-1

Spirit got me from point A to point B on time and safe. The aircraft look new however inside it looked liked it needed a cleaning. The big front seat is always a plus. The ground crew and the in-flight crew could be friendlier. Spirit is very clear in their advertising, they are an ultra low-cost airline, you get exactly what you pay for and for me it’s good enough. I fly with them at least once every 3 months and I will continue to do so. Overall, good job Spirit!",1
2019-10-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Myrtle Beach,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,a waste of money and time,True,  New York to Myrtle Beach. This airline is awful don’t even bother to book anything it’s a waste of money and time. I bought a flight from NYC to FL for vacation and rented a hotel I was suppose to check in at 7:50 my flight was suppose to land at 7:30. My flight got delayed from 12:30 to 2:30 I arrive at the airport at 1:30 and check my bag I am heading to the gate when they have closed it at 2pm. First of all they said to be at gate 42 then changed it to gate 41. When I arrived there the worker told me they’ll start boarding at 2:10. When I came back the gate was close at 2pm the airplane was still there and they wouldn’t open the door and said we need to reschedule the next flight to FL but was full so the next available flight was in NJ and it’s arrival time was at 11:40pm. Before this the lady told me since the next flight was full the next available would be in the morning and I ask where am I even gonna sleep she rudely said the airport. I had to pay a cab from nyc to NJ $70 to be able to flight same day. I called customer service to at least get an extra day since I wasted half a day already and they couldn’t even do that I basically payed more for a horrible service. They couldn’t even refund me the money and I wasn’t the only one who stayed behind but 9 other people did too. Overall customer service and the airline its self are horrible you are better of paying a little more for a good airline.,-1

They will not help you in any possible way if your flight is canceled or delayed. I planned everything according to my flight's booking. I checked out from hotel as my flight was tonight. Now flight from Vegas got canceled and was rescheduled after 24 hours. I was like homeless for this 24 hours. My job supposed to start next day. Family members were waiting and worried. I called customers service to help me in any possible way. But the only option they will give you is we can cancel your reservation and give you future Credit (this is not the option we look in this situation) even after talking to customer service manager for hours no one helped me. Pay extra $50 or $100 dollar for another flight but Avoid this cheap category, useless, and worse flight for your own safety. Avoid for your own good, Avoid for your own benefits. If you don't believe me try this at your own risk(high risk)",-1
2019-10-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Boston,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,needs to get it together,True,"  Spirit Airlines needs to get it together. I had heard bad things about Spirit prior to flying them, but figured folks were being dramatic. I flew them once to round-trip to Boston and it was okay - the flights were delayed by 2+ hours and the seats were dirty, but we got from point A to point B for a good price. However, I tried booking them again for a flight and it was terrible before even boarding the plane. I booked tickets in October for a flight December 9th. Then I get get a voice message (low-quality, sound cutting out) at around midnight on October 24th saying my flight is cancelled and to call back this random number. I received no email notification of the cancellation. So, I call. I spend 15+ minutes on hold and the first guy hangs up on me after poor phone service on his end and him saying I need to call back tomorrow to rebook my flight. I call again. This time the person's voice was at least intelligible-- not cutting out. Rep #2 tells me I have three choices: 1) rebook, 2) refund, or 3) credit, but the major caveat: there are now NO flights available in December until the 19th. Meanwhile, I'm checking on Google flights and I found one available, but Rep#2 keeps repeating there are no flights, unapologetically and almost gleefully? I've worked telefunding, so I try to be patient-- working a call line can truly suck- but the logistical inconvenience and the lack of acknowledgement of the logistical inconvenience was insane . Long story short: I'm fortunate and could afford to fly Delta for $70 on Dec 9th, but for other people, swinging an extra $70 may not even be possible. Again, Spirit needs to get its act together.",-1

We flew into O'hare Saturday night, and our bag was left back in Dallas. We were told by staff it would come on flight 1st thing Sunday morning, and it would be shipped to us and we would have Sunday afternoon. This bag had both my wife and daughters medicine that was needed to be taken daily, and we live 2.5 hours away. We decided to believe them, rather then stay the night in a hotel room, only to call Sunday morning and be told ""no, we won't shipped it until Monday and you will have it Tuesday"". So I then turned around and drove back to Chicago, another 2.5 hours to pick up bag on Sunday. A wasted 5 hour trip.",-1
2019-10-23,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,2.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,extremely amazing and helpful staff,True,"  In 30 years of flying, I have encountered some extremely amazing and helpful staff (and some extremely rude ones, as well). Yesterday I began to feel very nauseous after boarding. The pilots had to wait probably 20 min, prior to take off for a possible mechanical issue and logging paperwork.  I just kept feeling worse. This has never happened to me in flight before. Once in the air, the plane had to go thru some weather that caused major extended turbulence (which couldn't be avoided). A little girl in a seat in front of me also got sick. The flight attendants that were handling coach, Matt and Miguel (Mike), were so quick to ask me if I'd eaten at all and provide a ginger ale, on the hopes it was my blood sugar, while also attending to the little one in front of me, who was vomiting. All of this, while other passengers were inquiring about their needs, asking for beverages, or needing to get up. For everyone's safety, they kept aisle traffic down to a minimum, other than those who couldn't wait any longer to use the facilities. They kept their cool and were so patient and accommodating with everyone. Nothing phased these guys! They had also informed the attendants up front who continued to check in with me when I had to use the facilities in the front of the plane. The pilots also kept us well informed and tried different elevations to make the flight more confortable. I had asked Matt to give me their names earlier in the flight because I wanted to thank them by posting a positive review of all their assistance. To top it off, right before landing, Matt handed me a paper with everyone's name on it and added that it could be used for a free round trip ticket! Thru it all, this crew worked together and managed to leave me and many others with a smile on what otherwise could've been a real nightmare flight. Please give these guys the recognition and respect they deserve for a job well done! I truly hope Spirit Airlines and their customers realize that people, not machines, are what make all the difference. We can all get consumed in devices and automation these days, but taking the time to be personable with others, can deepen our appreciation for one another and turn a bad experience into a memory we won't forget!",1

Not at this horrendous airline but at myself for making the mistake of ever traveling with Spirit again. I made a promise to never travel with them years ago but this time I was headed to Vermont to fall foliage drive and the time perfectly matched when I needed to travel. I’m not interested in budget travel. When I booked my flight I must’ve paid for my one suitcase for both ways then this am when I was checking in for my flight it asked me if I wanted to pay for my luggage so I did. By error as I’d already paid for it and totally forgot. Tried calling them to cancel at once and shot, after two hours literally no one came on to answer the call. Went to the airport early to speak to an agent and she informs me that the fees are not refundable. I tried to have her show me where on the site does it say that when you’re purchasing the ticket and we got nowhere. This airline is simply disgusting. I won’t even bother with details of how I hate them so very much. They’re leeches and so greedy. Why should I pay twice for one bag and yes it was my mistake but does customer service mean nothing? I will absolutely without error never travel with these parasites ever again. I’d rather pay twice the price for a ticket and get my free of coffee and be done with.",-1

The worst company to fly with, not only do they lie to customers it seems like the customer service attendants at the airport make up their own rules. First we had to pay $99 dollars because we missed the flight, but  we couldn’t get another flight for later that night only for the next day. Then when we come back the next day we have to pay $50 dollars for a luggage check that was not overweight.  Not to mention their customer service reps at the airport tell you to sign up for the “$9” fare club, but you pay $59.95 for the membership. At every airport we went to LAX, San Diego, Chicago, and Vegas Spirit overbook their flights and are begging for passengers to give up their tickets for different accommodations! The flights are cheap, but they charge for everything so that makes up for the “cheap” tickets! I would not recommend Spirit Airlines.",-1

Unfortunately flight got delayed by an hour and later on they said it has been canceled. And all spirit staff was not announcing anything but we were getting email notifications simultaneously. Those staff were totally unprofessional and said that they don’t know what is the reason of cancellation. Then they give as hotel and saying that we will be flying next day at 10:10 am. Unfortunately that one also got delayed and finally we flew on 11:45 am. We had hotel and car reservations for Saturday night in Las Vegas and Spirit ruin everything. It was my first trip with Spirit airline and definitely the last too.,-1

2019-10-18,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Columbus,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,Will never fly with spirit again,True,  Spirit airlines decided that my 7 year old and 10 year old daughter with down syndrome did not need to sit with an adult. When i did online checkin we were separated. I went to gate and let employee know that we were all separated. I said i dont care if the 4 of us are split up into 2 pairs. I just want my children to have a parent with them. The rude girl at the gate said there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak to a supervisor. Waited for 30 minutes. Never showed up. Finally went to a random separate gate and explained the situation. She called over to my gate and said it was medically necessary to put us together. At this point nothing was fixed but at least she tried to help. Finally at the very end we were given seats with our kids. I filed a complaint with spirit. Still waiting on a resolution. Ever wonder why they ask for age of kids? In 2016 Congress passed a family flying together act which says kids under 13 should be sat with an adult and should not be charged more for it. Spirit knows when doing random check in that they are separating minors from adults. They hope that you will panic and pay more to sit with your child. They get around this act because if you OFFER to pay more by picking your seats together they arent technically charging you to sit with child. Will never fly with spirit again. I guess they assumed whatever adult was sitting by my daughter would automatically be her caretaker for the flight? Does that sound fair to anyone??,-1
2019-10-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Charlotte,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"the people are rude, the hidden fees are ridiculous",True," On both trips (to NJ and then returning to NC), our flight was delayed for no other reason than just personnel stupidity. On our flight home (to Charlotte, NC from Newark, NJ), my son and I watched the aircraft clear out its incoming customers into the airport. A few minutes later the kiosk woman said on the loud speaker that our flight was going to be boarding shortly, that they would announce when it was time to board, and that zone 1 would be boarding first. Since I was traveling with an 8 year old, and was zone 1, I decided to go ahead and just wait in line at zone 1 so I could board quickly and get settled with my son. As I approached the head of the zone 1 line the kiosk lady very rudely told me that you can not wait in line, that the airplane had not unloaded yet. I said ok sorry and left the line regardless of her rudeness. I did not want to be in the way of people arriving. I thought this was odd because I could have sworn that this plane had unloaded already. Not even 2 minutes later a ton of people flocked to the loading line for zone 1. Mind you, there was no further announcement. Really? This lady just kicked me out of line, which I was first in, and than proceeds to allow approximately 20 other people stand in the same line which put us further than 20 people back. Don’t get me wrong, it would have been nice to be 1st on the plane with an 8 year old, but what really annoyed me was getting kicked out of line then her letting 20 people get in line. This airline sucks, the people are rude, the hidden fees are ridiculous.",-1

What the useless and unempathetic Spirit teller did not tell me is that my return flight from LAX back to Denver was automatically cancelled despite me paying full price for the flight and Baggage fees. I didn’t find out until I attempted to check-in hours before my flight. No email, no text, no phone call. They refused to do anything to accommodate me - no credit, no refunds. They stated this is their policy and can be found in their 44 page terms and conditions you are forced to check when booking. They only offered me to buy another ticket for the same flight and pay full price which costs had tripled since it was the day of flight, and baggage fees too. Unbelievable!",-1

While sitting in the airport many time threw the speaker staffed offered volunteers to flight at a later time due to flight over booked. The Las Vegas supervisor was rude and of no help.

I arrived at the airport at 6.05am, made it to the kiosk at 6.10am which directed me to the desk. Stood in line for two minutes all for me to be told that I can not board my flight that leaves at 7.00am. Staff member was very rude and inconsiderate. The time that he spent looking for tickets for another flight he could’ve been checking me in. It was also a $99 fee to for the new flight which was way more than the ticket previous I purchased. I didn’t have any bags I needed to check, so all he had to do was print out a ticket. We went back and forth and at the time it was 6.32am and I pointed it out to him that I still have about 30 mins to make the flight, he still refused. I will be spending a total of 9hrs in the airport when I had a non-stop flight to New Orleans, LA. When I made it to the gate I was curious so I asked that agent at the gate did the flight leave yet. She stated no the plane did not leave, but they just closed the door. That time that he was standing there trying to find a ticket I could have been through TSA. I literally dislike Spirit I wouldn’t care if Spirit is the last airline standing, I’ll walk! Shame on you Spirit, horrible customer service and don’t get me started on the customer support which was an even worst experience!",-1

I got off an already delayed layover flight from Denver. I had to run all through out the Florida airport to get to my gate: F2 and I go there. It had closed and she saw that I was in a rush and she let me in, which I was very thankful for. Until, they realized I was on the wrong flight. They told me: G13. So, I had to run all the way back, when I got to the desk, I was out of breathe and still had a few tears. The staff was utterly rude for absolutely no reason. Like I understand I need to “calm down” but was it my fault that my flight was delayed before? Spirit will not be my first choice.",-1

I get to the airport, and my 12am flight is cancelled. So here I am in the middle of Oakland, and the next earliest flight is at 6am, and it’s not even direct. Not only did they not offer a hotel, considering it was 12am in a sketchy area, but they didn’t offer any compensation for transportation to SFO, the only airport nearby that had a flight for Sunday. Okay so I buy a $30 Uber after waiting for 30 minutes trying to get my flight transferred and arrive at SFO. But then I try to check in at SFO, and they say the ticket wasn’t paid for by Spirit and I have to call them. So I call them, and they have one of those cell trees and it takes me 30 minutes to get in contact with an employee. I ended up sleeping on the ground at SFO and got on a 6am flight. In short: Spirit has the worst customer service. They can cancel a flight for basically no reason (the weather was fine and they failed to give me a reason). Then they don’t help with transportation or hotels. So I spent $300 on a flight where I had to sleep on the ground of the airport and I paid for flight insurance. I recommend never flying with them, it’s not worth the headache.",-1

Horrible horrible customer service. I fly Spirit Airlines on a regular basis along with my family. I am currently sitting in Fort Myers airport trying to book a outgoing flight and not one Spirit agent is available. I am looking at empty computers, empty desks.

Let me start off by saying Spirit is the worst airline I have experienced and I have used RyanAir. I had a flight back home from FL and my return flight got canceled 3 times, due to a hurricane, before I decided to drive back all the way to NJ. Spirit wouldn’t give me a refund but gave me a voucher for my next trip, I don’t like Spirit but I took it versus losing money. This so called vouchers can only be used if you call in to get a flight, where they will charge you 2-3 times more than what you would see online. This is obviously a tactic to keep customers money instead of actually giving a refund. You must use you voucher with in 30 days or you lose it or use it and pay for a flight that is over priced so in the end you never get your money back. The customer service is mind blowing I can’t even put it in words. Don’t try to save money with spirit who charge you for everything and does not support the people that are supporting their business.",-1

Its the gate agents and the rude customer service they offer. Flew Orlando to Los Angeles via Cleveland with my backpack and my wife had a small wheel bag and 0 issues. From LA to Orlando now they had an issue with the bag since it was a carry on not a personal bag. It fit in the personal item dimensions. They made a fuzz and threatened that now they had to charge me the entire flight including Orlando to LA for that item. When i told then it wasn't ok they just decided to ignore me. Ended up paying since they wouldn't board me. 0 customer skills, listening and not a way to treat people. Gate agent said she was the manager and refused to listened to my issue, story and the fact that i had never had an issue with that bag. You cant enforce the rules only when you want and the way you want. No consistency. Horrible customer experience.",-1

The last time I tried, I accepted the ""$9 saver plan"" even though while navigating the site, it told me I was entitled to one bag without additional cost, when it came down to reviewing the charges, approx $200 was added for the one bag and about $175 for the seat selection which it said on the previous page was also complementary. They I could not change it. I tried to delete it and start again, only to get the same answer. I gave up and booked another airline and I will never select them again. On the previous travel to the same location, I had to change my flight time. Spirit charged more for the change in flight, than I would have paid, simply throwing away the first ticket, and buying a completely new ticket. They refused to correct that. And by the way, on that flight it also overcharged for the bags and seat. I had still flown on Spirit, but I had to book the flight through another portal. And yes, checking in is difficult when needing to check a bag. That process went unecessarily slow also. Even though, I prechecked my bag, when I arrived at the airport, I first had to wait in a line to go through an automated system to issue the baggage ticket, and wait in still another line to surrender the bad to the airline.",-1

I booked a flight from Dallas to BWI with a layover at O'Hare for $90. I needed to push the time back or just get on at O'Hare. I called & texted only to find out that I would have to pay a difference of $234. A new ticket from O'Hare to BWI was only $136 so I payed that price instead plus $49 for a carry-on because they stated that I purchased it too late(online a day before the flight). I get there and they offer $250 credit if you take a later flight because they overbooked. I agree only for them to say never mind. Plane is scheduled to leave at 8:03am, once we're all on board a drunk man throws up on himself and a few other passengers now we have to deplane. 8:48 is the new time, we all enter the plane & takeoff, at 9:40 we find out that 2 other drunks were causing problems and flooded the bathroom. We have to return to O'Hare to get them off the plane and now takeoff is 10:16. And all they could say was they're sorry and offer us cookies and water. This is crazy we all saw that man couldn't even get to his seat alone in the terminal 20 minutes before take off and then needed help getting on the plane. Why was he even allowed to enter the plane? I paid $275 for a 2 hour flight because of my mistake while Spirit is charging for everything and offers little to nothing when they inconvenience you.",-1

Please do yourself the favor and don’t try to save a “few dollars”, you’ll end up regretting it like me and my family. I booked starting from google. I didn’t realize it changed the flight time from google to the Spirit website until 4 days later. I wanted to book an 8 pm flight, but I didn’t realize it changed to the 8 am flight. Since then, I have tested every other airline from google to the airline website and it keeps the date and time you select. Spirit changes to the “best” available, however the 8 am and 8 pm flight were the exact same price, which is why I didn’t catch it right away. I spent over 3 hours on the phone with them with their best resolution being to pay as much as double to modify the flight, even after I explained to several different people what happened. They are flat out rude, deceptive and completely unfair and unrealistic with their customers. I filed a complaint and have yet to hear back from them, however they keep sending me surveys so I can tell them how they’re doing. The whole company is a joke! I regret ever thinking it was a good idea to save money. I submitted a complaint with the department of transportation, as well.",-1

They charge for everything separate, even for a pesonal small bag. I pre paid my bag online ahead to avoid doing this at the airport to the find out that they did not have it prepaid on my boarding pass. When bording I was humiliated by a very rude woman named claiming that I didn't pay for the bag and had to get out of the line and go to the counter to be checked. I asked her what was the purpose of paying prepaid (of course avoiding the humiliation in front of all passengers but she became offensive), I showed her a confirmation email receipt for the one bag and my bank charge receipt from my bank account but that wasn't enough for her. The aircraft had to wait for me and I was the last person to board and get seated and it felt very humiliating. I will never fly with this airline again.

By the time they nickel and dime you, you could fly a real airline with complimentary amenities. This airline has very uncomfortable aircraft with no amenities whatsoever. Even a drink will cost you several dollars. They charge for carry on luggage and their weight limit on checked bags is much lower than what is standard for all other airlines. This way they get another $55 out of you each way in addition to the regular checked baggage fee. The only thing I can say is the flight attendants were very nice. Upon landing, the plane rattled so loudly as if it would fall apart. I’ve flown hundreds of times and never heard anything like this. I didn’t feel safe flying with Spirit and I spent far more than I would have with a real airline who could provide comfort and amenities for no extra charge. Never again!",-1

I was left with 2 options, leave my luggage for a 2 week vacation and check in since I still had 40 minutes before my flight or purchase tickets with another airline.

I immediately called Spirit and only got scripted responses from their “customer service. “ I asked where the people I asked for a manager. Her responses were scripted also. I asked where my call was with and was told the Philippines. I asked to speak to someone in the US and was told: “There is no one in the states"". I mentioned that there headquarters are in Texas, but there was no acknowledgement. So I went the email route, which took several weeks of back and forth. Spirit has no customer service. They also don’t allow for a mistake on their faulty website when addressed instantly. The fact that you can’t talk to anyone by phone in the country they are based shows they don’t have any desire to be an airline that cares.

Fees make the flights just as expensive as other carriers (sometimes more expensive) unless you don't have a carry-on or check-in bag. Carry-on used to be allowed but now they charge for that. No in-flight movies or snacks. The seats are ridiculously small with no legroom. I am 6'2"" and weight 240 pounds. It was extremely uncomfortable. Costs over $50 extra to a decent seat. I had to change a flight a week before my originally scheduled flight because a family member took a turn for the worse, and I pleaded my case but they just cited policies. The cost to change the flight cost more than the original price of the ticket. When I told the customer service I would just cancel, get a refund, and buy a new ticket they told me it would end up costing more than changing the flight with the cancellation fees and how much they keep of your original ticket price. They think of every way they can to show you an initial low price, then make it way more expensive. I will not be booking with Spirit again. I will gladly pay extra to fly with another airline.",-1

The one to go there was with Delta but the one coming back was with Spirit. I got to Guatemala with my group and then I went to go check in for my departure 24 hours before I was going to go back with them. I went to my email and checked in and my flight status said canceled. I didn't cancel my flight! And it was like 10:30 the night before I was suppose to be on a flight. I didn't have service where I was staying so I found a place with wifi and asked my husband to call the airline and get it fixed so that I wouldn't be stuck there. They said it had been canceled due to something with my card but when we called the bank they said they approved the purchase. They still canceled it and didn't tell me at all. They never sent an email letting me know they just basically let me fly to Guatemala with no way home. They wouldn't let me husband talk to their manager or anything and all they could do was help him buy another flight for me at the same time but the original flight was $129 and this flight was $280 because it was the day before. So we ended up paying more the double for a flight i had already booked days before. 10 minutes later I got an email saying that my flight had been canceled.  I am so angry that no know understood what had happened or why and they were not  willing to compensate us and at least give us the original flight deal. I will not be booking with them again.,-1

I had a flight to catch at 4:43pm at Houston airport. Due to the traffic I set in for 4 hrs. Only because due to the tropical storm they had 4 days ago that had parts of Houston under water. The highway to the Bush international airport was close due to flooding. So this made travelers have to take another route. Which we set in for 4 hours. I called Spirit Airlines to see if they can work something out due to this not being my fault. I had one of the customer service laugh at me like I was a joke, one of the supervisors was very sarcastic about returning my money or giving me another flight. She told me it was nothing they can do but I can purchase another ticket that you just lost your money. No kind of heart at all was very ugly. I will not do purchase a ticket with them again.

My friend tried upgrading there ticket into a larger seat because he is tall and was just very uncomfortable the lady was very snobby and said “it’s not my fault that your tall And decided to fly”. Upon leaving going to our second stop we arrived in Chicago And the gate agent Patricia was very helpful and the nicest one that we had met the whole entire day meanwhile we started flying at 9 am and got to Chicago at 4:30 pm. So many hours of dealing with rude people for simple questions.  The only nice person was Patricia in Chicago who was able to upgrade our seat and make everyone a little bit more comfortable for the remaining 3 hour trip back to New York. Baggage - the baggage weight is 10 pounds lighter so 40 pounds is what you have to stay under when almost all other airlines is 50 pounds and under. The baggage fees are crazy 50 bucks for one bag and your carry on bag is 65 plus if you go over the 40 pounds you have to it the $50.00 plus additional $65.00 just to board. You pay if you want to switch your seat, you pay for sodas, water is $3.00 literally everything. The only free things is a cup of ice and that depends on the crew working.

As we were trying to check our baggage, we were told our flight was cancelled! We were told the plane had been held in Boston for maintenance. The ticket counter staff was less than helpful. They even refused to answer questions about assurances of a flight the next day. When I’m asked if we had to count on the same aircraft being available the next day I was told “probably”. Basically they just wanted me to agree to try to fly the next day or just get the fare refunded. No offer to help, make any other arrangements, etc. I told them I wanted a refund! While I was upset about our own situation, what made me the more angry was that there were several people there who had a worse situation. It was a Sunday and they were scheduled to fly on the same flight to Ft. Lauderdale for cruise hoardings. The cancellation really screwed up their plans. Our own trip was cancelled and we lost over $3000. The Spirit employees acted as if they couldn’t have cared less! They just wanted everyone to move along. No apology or anything! Cheap, but unreliable. We will never use Spirit again. Advise readers to avoid them.",-1
2019-09-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to New Orleans,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Do not be fooled,False,"  Dallas to New Orleans. It’s extremely difficult to understand this company’s strategy. Apparently it’s to take you for as much money as possible one time because clearly they are not seeking repeat customers. Do not be fooled by their low ticket costs. If you have to take bags with you, you will end up paying double the ticket price in bag fees. Oh, and did I mention that the fees escalate and seem to vary based on day and mood of the idiot in charge at the moment! Needless to say, I will never fly Spirit Airlines again.",-1
2019-09-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,will never fly with them again,True,"  I booked a round trip through expedia from New Orleans to Las Vegas. When I went to print out my itinerary out, my outgoing flight had been cancelled. Reason was you can not book a round with Spirit and Frontier, but no one notified me of this. I had 2 days to book another one way outgoing flight and have not been reimbursed as of yet. They said 3 business days. Then it cost me $348 for 2 people 1 carry on and 1 checked bag and don't bother paying for an assigned seat. The rep offered no resolution what so ever or would not even give me a credit. Frontier bags are $118, but Spirit charges new baggage charges at every stop. I will never fly with them again. If they would have let me cancel all flights, I would have flown with delta.",-1
2019-09-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore Washington to Seattle,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,False,"  Baltimore Washington to Seattle. It was not advertised that refreshments, including water, were not free. I had to pay $3 for a bottle of water during a 5.5 hr flight. The seats are hard molded plastic with maybe 2 mm of cushion. The flight back was cancelled due to lack of personnel to complete the flight, not because of plane issues, but personnel issues. I was 12 hours late getting home. Thank God I flew Delta home, much better.  I had to inquire about getting my baggage fees back from the attendant informing me I was leave the next morning on delta. He knew I paid for baggage. I figured the baggage fees would transfer to the flight on Delta. I had to pay for the Delta flight separately and then return to spirit to inquire about the baggage cost. Only then did they refund the money. I was going to be stranded over night at SeaTac. I was not offered a place to stay. Only after I inquired about the situation they caused, I was told that a hotel stay was possible. In other words, the airline cancelled a flight due to personnel issues then tried to leave myself and my family stranded over night. Long story short, Spirit does not care for its workers or its passengers. I will never fly Spirit again.",-1

We were boarded on time, the staff was polite and the flight crew was funny. We actually got to Orlando 15 minutes early! I’m taking my daughter to Disney for the first time so the timely flight was much appreciated! Thanks Spirit, also one of the flight attendants took the time to speak to and explain all her silly questions during descent and was an absolute pleasure, from my experience today I’d 100% fly with them again!",1

A few of my friends and I were heading down to Florida for spring break and the spirit of our vacation was wrecked by Spirit Airlines. We arrived at O'Hare at 9.30 in the morning for a flight due to depart at 11.30. Two hours before hand we head to the gate and see that the boarding time is 11.10. That time rolled around and there was no employee to be seen to board the plane. Then 11.30 rolled around and someone finally came and told us the flight had been delayed 5 hours due to mechanical problems. Fast forward 5 hours and we are on the plane getting ready to leave when they said the crew had ""timed-out"" and they didn't have staff to run the flight. We sat on the plane with no water, snacks, nothing for an additional 2.5 hours waiting for them to find a crew. At that point we finally got out of Chicago. Now, fast forward to Fort Meyers (where we landed nearly 8 hours late) when we were waiting for the bags we checked they were nowhere to be found. Apparently, they ended up in Baltimore! Then they said in order to get our bags back that we would need to pay an additional $50 to put them on another plane to Fort Myers! We ended up flying Southwest back home because Spirit is the worst airline in the United States.",-1

We've been told that they might find another aircraft, repair the aircraft that was for the other flight, or they might reschedule the entire flight. About two hours has past since we were to board and no Spirit staff knows what will happen. Also, Spirit isn't really cheaper in the long run since they charge for everything possible.

I payed an additional $400 for my round trip ticket by the time it was all over. It was too late to book anywhere else because we wasn’t aware of all the hidden baggage and overweight charges until it was too late! There is no usb, soft or hard drinks, snacks (and on my way home there wasn’t even a let down tray to use) available on the flight! It was a horrible experience! I will never fly with them again!

If you don't have extra funds to book another airline if you have an emergency, you end up being stuck at that airport. I have heard enough disappointments with spirit airlines that I would advice anyone to use spirit.Please my advice to anyone out there is that do not use spirit airline,choose another airline besides spirit airlines.

I had time to buy a ticket on a different airline and when I was going towards the new gate I saw that they were barely boarding my Spirit flight.  I will never ever fly with Spirit again.

A friend of mine, traveling in the same flight spoke with Spirit 2 days ago and they told that the flight will be cancelled, however yesterday I came to the airport and a woman told me that everything was ok with the flight. I came to the airport today 3 am and the flight was cancelled. What type of customer service is that? Spirit knows in advance that the flight will be cancelled, but they prefer the customer comes to the airport at 3 am to say “hey your flight is cancelled because of the weather”, that’s not fair. It is an irresponsibility. The worst customer experience ever!",-1

My flight was cancelled without any warning. I did not receive an email or text. When I mentioned that to the agent, she just said oh sorry. Instead, she should have offered to investigate the issue and follow up to ensure it does not happen again. I waited an hour and 25 minutes on hold until I was able to be connected to an agent. Once connected, my flight was cancelled with no notice due to ""weather"" and Spirit was trying to book me on an 18 hour flight with a stop in Fort Lauderdale where the hurrican is supposed to hit - are you kidding me?  When we asked when the next nonstop flight was, we were told not for 4 more days,  unbelievable. Thanks for the lousy refund only to have to find our own flight home and pay triple last minute.

Airport was open, even next day, all the other airlines flights were active but only spirit airlines flights were canceled. When I asked them the reason for cancelation, The response was “We are the safest airline”. Flight status showed 3 hours delay on their website and The email they sent a couple days before also showed 3 hours delay but they don't even bother themselves to notify passengers in advance for cancelation so people could have looked for other options. It was already too late for other alternatives. Do yourself a favor, pay a little bit more and fly with professional companies, you save time and money in the end.",-1

I was given a $50 Voucher to be used on a future flight due to my original flight being delayed 3 or more hours. When I went to use this $50 voucher to book a future flight, I was told it would not be able to be used. The agent explained that the voucher can only be used against base fares. For the flight I was trying to book it was $54 each way. The base fare for each of these legs of the trip are .20. Yes you read that, twenty cents. Therefore the voucher is not valid because it must be greater than $50. When I asked if this would always be an issue the agent basically told me yes because the majority of each fare is broken down into taxes, passenger fees and government fees. So why even offer these vouchers when you know that they’ll never be able to be used?! I am a very loyal customer and this makes me think twice about every using their airline again. It’s fraudulent and just wrong to mislead customers in this manner.",1
2019-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to New York LaGuardia,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines did nothing,False,"  Worst airplane ever. The pilot didn’t show up at first and we were given keys to an inn overnight for a morning flight the next day and they were out of rooms so my friends family and my family shared a room with 1 bed making it extremely cramped. When asking for solutions the only option was to be sent back to the airport and by the time everything was resolved it’d be morning as it was currently 12 am. Right after the next morning we went to the airport hoping to board our flight. As we were checking into the plane, my friends family was kicked off the flight as there had been a cut of 60 people from the plane due to over capacity. We were directed to agent assistance where they told us to head to rebooking after waiting in a 30 minute line. My family had to board in 10 minutes so we were asking the counter at the checking in if there were any quicker options at the moment. We were then alerted 3 volunteers gave up their seat and were so thankful to know my friends family were able to board. Spirit Airlines did nothing but were extremely rude as well, I saw some guests panicking to rush to their flight elsewhere and asked the workers to help them but the lady ignored her and instead laughed and pushed her off as she was frantically panicking. The workers are extremely rude and made my vacation turn completely, they are not trained in customer service at all but are rather arrogant and rude.",-1

2019-08-30,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,,,,,,,1.0,their way of getting more money,True,"  Orlando to Denver. I booked a flight for my boss fir tomorrow, purchased the insurance that they recommended to cover travel, they represent it as most airlines do, a way to turn it into a refundable ticket. Not Spirit, they mislead you and the insurance only covers flight changes that they make, cancellations they make and when they lose your things. All airlines are already responsible for those things, so you're buying insurance that covers absolutely nothing. Oh, well it does cover death and dismemberment for $25K, last I checked you can get a heck of a lot more without their policy, death and dismemberment is worth more than that. Booked the flight, bought the insurance, rec'd the confirmation of the insurance with the flight information on the policy, but no confirmation from the airlines. Called the airlines and they claim there is no record of any booking. What? They sent the flight information and passenger information to the insurance company who was provided their portion of the $$ for coverage. Only Spirit Airlines had that information, we didn't call the insurance company and ask to be covered, that was all done online by Spirit. We then spent an hour on the phone to get the insurance credited, then re book the flight, only at a  higher cost. Clearly they overbooked at the lower rate, and this was their way of getting more money, We paid over $100 more for the rebooking, and paid again for insurance. We had to cancel the following day, and Spirit is charging approx. $150 to cancel the flight and learned that they lied, the ins doesn't cover the cancellation of a ticket. No credit to your CC, you can use the credit on future travel. They keep your $$ knowing you'll never come back.",-1

Beside that I was charged $65 for a carry-on bag that I'm dragging in the plane, lifting and put over my head and taking back down myself is ridiculous even though the flight was not full and the over head bins had a lot of space because there was barely any people on the flight. And on top of that the gate attendant was rude telling me I need to pay for my carry on bag. The first flight was delayed (it seems like all Spirit flight is never on time). The seats was really hard just siting for an hour and there's nothing to watch after spending all that Money in add on charges. This airline makes no sense the overall charge is more than a airline that charge for everything upfront. Sorry I'll stick to Delta for my flights they never fail. Horrible service!",-1

A few weeks after booking my flight, I found out that I was pregnant and my doctor advised against going to Florida with zika being a concern. I had to cancel my flight and trip to see my 95 year old grandfather, much to my disappointment. After submitting my doctors note, I was informed that i would have a credit for my tickets with 60 days to use that credit for tickets that could be purchased 6 months in advanced. These tickets can only be used for me and my 2 year old son. I would either be flying while still pregnant or with a brand new infant and a toddler. As a teacher, my travel options are limited. When I asked for a refund instead, I was informed that it was outside of the 24 hour cancellation period and that they were being generous for not charging me for the cancellation. When I mentioned to them that I didn't know that I was pregnant within the 24 hour cancellation period, an agent told me that it doesn't matter as it is their policy. I should have paid the extra 50 dollars for a better ticket and a better airline. I have only heard terrible things about Spirit airlines and I understand why.",-1

2019-08-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst travel experience,True,  Los Angeles to Houston. Our 3 hour flight was by far the worst travel experience. My husband and a few close friends booked the flight to Houston from LAX as a means to get to Galveston as we had a 7 day cruise ahead of us. We were unfamiliar with paying for carry on bag fees and so we watched some YouTube videos along with some helpful reviews to get some feedback on how to properly prepare for flight. The bag fees felt overpriced and by the time we got done double stuffing our luggage to downsize some of our things were sitting out our feet taking up what little spade we had available in our row. The seating was so compact it didn’t even offer a let down tray to place a water bottle. Humans just shouldn’t be transported as such as it was a tight fit the entire way and myself being only 5’4 inches tall my knees were actually touching the back of the seat ! Packed like sardines and with no money being saved because after the bag fees and associated tax we came out spending what would have been the same price on other local airlines with far more comfort. It literally felt like riding in a small school bus while holding our own luggage. This company’s practices to save a few bucks by cutting out row space and trays is just down right terrible. Our flying experience was less than satisfactory and we will make it a point to never fly with them again in the future .,-1
2019-08-26,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Portland to Atlanta,,,,,,,1.0,there is no need to be rude,False,"  I booked a round trip between Portland, OR and Atlanta through Expedia. For whatever reasons, this round trip was booked as two separate trips. Because the person I was going to meet got sick, and sent me an email 26 hours before the out-bound flight's scheduled taking off time, and it was on a Sunday, I did not read the email until the 23 hours before flight's scheduled departing time. Be very careful if you ever consider to fly via Spirit Airlines. First, the cancellation fee is very high; for my out-bound trip, it was $100. Since I cancelled within 24 hours, no cash refund - only a small portion of my ticket (in my case ~$60) as ""credits"" toward future trip that must take place in 60 days. My returning trip, if cancelled, will yield no refund at all. Therefore, basically, I am not getting any cent of the $290.43 I paid for the tickets back. Second, do not expect any special consideration. For example, I booked a round trip, but Expedia actually gave two separate bookings (out-bound and return trips; I do not know how Expedia deals with Spirit Airlines). Thus, cancellation fees for two trips would apply. Third, the customer server person I was talking with was very rude. I was asking if they might consider this as a special case since I booked a round trip, but it ended up being two separate trips. The customer server person simply said (I don't remember the exact sentence, but this was what he meant) it was Expedia's problem, not ours! Also, even though you might have booked via Expedia, any cancellation must be through Spirit Airlines, not Expedia. I understand we all have rules, and I was only discussing the possibility, but there is no need to be rude. Spirit Airlines is the cheapest. This is the first time I tried to use it, and it will be the last time that I will ever use it. Definitely would NOT recommend it to my friends - one would get a much much better value using decent airlines.",-1

After an 8 hour delay, Spirit canceled our flight. There was very poor communication from Spirit. Spirit was not able to get us out of Cancun that day so offered to put us on a bus to hotel, provide dinner, etc. That turned out to be s nightmare. All 200 passengers waited 49 minutes in 100 degree heat for buses. No Spirit employee was around to let us know when buses would be there abd where we were going They took us to a hotel 40 minutes away and then there was a 2 hour wait to check into hotel since there were almost 200 people. By the time we got to our hotel rooms it was after 11 pm They told us we had to check out by 5:20 to the bus back to airport for 8:30 flight. Once again a line of 200 people waiting to load buses in 100 degree heat and NO spirit rep to help We get to airport and are told Spirit counter doesn’t open till 9! We had an 8:30 flight. They did open up but once again on line with 200 people Our 8:30 flight was delayed an hour then another hour. We finally took off sometime after 10. On the flight we were told there would be no snacks available to purchase but water would be offered. They bring around Luke warm water! We land in Fort Lauderdale and some of us were rebooked by Spirit on connecting flights. Others were told it would be days before they could get them a connecting flight. I was lucky and only had an 8 hour layover! It’s 29 hours later and I’m still in the airport I will never book Spirit again! I’ve attached picture of the nightmare of waiting for bus to hotel and then at hotel waiting to check in I Should have booked my own hotel room near the airport to avoid that nightmare. That was truly awful!",-1

My family and I flew to Cancun through United airlines and it was a total success. We had an amazing vacation at Cancun until we flew back with Spirit Airlines. Spirit Airlines had us experience a complete nightmare. Spirit Airlines arrived on time, but had us sit in the plane for over two hours. After that we had to rush through custom, recheck our bags to make it on time to our connecting flight, to later find out it was cancelled. We then had to make a huge line to reschedule our flights with three tired and hungry kids. We spent over two hours in that line to be told that the next flight was two days later and on top of that it was a 24 hour flight with one connection to make it to New York. Only 50 percent of the money was refunded. They didn’t provide us with any other help. We also tried speaking to the manager at the Fort Lauderdale Airport, but she was extremely rude and unhelpful. I have no idea how she got that position when she has no customer service and loses her temper easily. Her words were “I am not going to deal with people like you”. We were very saddened by her treatment. After spending 8 hours in the airport we had no choice, but to stay in a hotel, rent a car and drive to New York. Our only option was to make the best of this unplanned road trip. Spirit Airlines is the worst company ever! At the end traveling with them means paying more money, having a bad time and being stranded!",-1
2019-08-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Oakland to Las vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no assistance or remorse,False,"  This airline has the least amount of concern for its customers. I have flown 4-8 times per month over the last year with Spirit Airlines roundtrip from Las Vegas, Nevada to Oakland, California. Greater than 50% of the time my flights have been delayed. The last flight was almost 3 hours delayed so they could muster up a flight crew we were told. I understand weather takes a toll in this business, but their recklessness regarding compensation is just that to say the least. I have been given a voucher by flight crew that was already expired, a valid voucher for $50, and a voucher for $50 that was only worth $3.72. When I speak with customer service there is absolutely no assistance or remorse for their errors. I am glad to spend more money with another airline to obtain decent customer service. I would not refer this airline to my worst enemy if I had one.",-1

We boarded in Atlanta on time, had a smooth, enjoyable flight and landed early in Newark. Lucky me, I was given a seat in first class. My friend was assigned further back in the plane. We were greeted by DeAngelo and Leandra with smiles. I asked if we could sit together if there were any available seats. They were more than happy to accommodate us, as soon as the plane finished loading passengers. They happily moved my friend next to me and even brought us wine to enjoy. It's so nice to be around happy, friendly people who obviously enjoy their jobs. Thank you for the exceptional customer service!",1
2019-08-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Myrtle Beach,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fly with Spirit again,True,"  I was going from Cancun to Florida then Boston when we kept on the plane for almost 3 hours and we missed our next flight after when we were trying to reschedule our flight from Florida to Boston they said they couldn’t do anything but get us on a plane on Sunday and it was Thursday and we had no place to stay little money a 3 year old and a 2 year old a pregnant lady and 2 seniors and another child. I knew it was a big party and we couldn’t fit in the next plane but they wouldn’t even take responsibility and give us a hotel room or something they said we had to fix things ourselves. And after that a lady saw we were going from Cancun to Florida then Boston and said that if we didn’t like the system here then why did we come visit assuming we had no papers. Then we told her we were actually u.s citizens that lived in Boston but went to visit some family in Cancun after that she went silent and after told us that we needed to fix things ourselves but we told her we were a lot of people and couldn’t find a hotel room that late at night it was 12am she kept telling us the same thing over and over again. After this experience I will never fly with Spirit again. Please don’t fly with spirit even if you want to save the extra change don’t because if you ever get in a situation like mine you have no guarantee of anything so just spend the extra money and work with a more professional airline, also personally I suggest spirit to hire better employees because I doubt this is the first and last time this will happen and they need to train people on how to handle these situations.",-1

When landing in Orlando , it took forever to get our luggage which made us late for our cruise in port Canaveral. We were not able to board the ship plus 5 other families were told it was too late. All spirit offered, was 3 $100 vouchers, no way is that enough compared to what we missed out on and what we lost out on. Never will we fly with Spirit again.

2019-08-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,They are the worst,False,  I came on here to let everyone that cares to listen know that you should not fly with Spirit Airlines. They are the worst. I read some previous reviews and can honestly attest to what they are saying about this airline not caring about anyone. They must either have the worst untrained pilots in the business or they just don't care about their customers. They delayed my flight twice and eventually they cancelled my flight even though they continued to check in the people that had a flight a couple of hours after ours. I ended up paying at extra $250 to get a flight home the next morning because all they could do is schedule on a flight two days later. I had to borrow money to cover my flight and then had to spend the night in the airport. The people at the counters are so rude that the girl helping just left midway and said that her shift was up. They also expect their customers to just politely accept the fact that they are screwing so many people over and not give a damn. There was a couple with a tiny baby and they did not know what to do but stay at the airport. They claimed that there was bad weather yet my aunt who was flying on United Airlines left an hour after my original departure time and flew to the west coast and got home before I did. I honestly do not think I will ever fly with this airline again and they should really not be in business. I wonder how many more disappointed customers have to suffer before the government shuts this company down. Money you save is not worth the headache you leave with. Spend the extra $100 or two and get your money's worth.,-1

Spirit Airlines canceled the flight after waiting 10 hours in the airport We were delayed for 2.5 hours due to no pilot. Finally Spirit boards us and lets us sit on the run way for 1.5 + hours and then forced us to deboard due to ""weather"" while countless flights departed all around us. With little to No updates ( unhelpful and not knowledgeable). It's 11:12pm here. They refuse to give anyone a hotel voucher because its due to 'weather'. This was the second flight with no pilot!",-1

",True," Las Vegas to Newark. Please pay the few extra dollars and travel with a legitimate airline/trust worthy. My first time traveling with Spirit Airlines never happened. Here is why, I waited 12 hrs because the flight kept being delayed. After 12 hours I was told my flight was canceled, and I wasn’t able to get another flight for two days. Spirit said that they will not accommodate me because this was a weather issue. This is false information because my husband tracks the weather. Anyway the manger in Las Vegas was the nastiest person I have ever dealt with, she had no interest in helping me. As for the transportation department I was told that they have to reimburse customers. I’m waiting to hear from a rep and see how this plays out. I will never use Spirit again. This experience was enough they had no consideration I was traveling with a child.",-1

Our initial flight got cancelled on our way into Cancun. We ended up getting a refund and rebooking another flight last minute. And on our way back home from Cancun, as we were waiting online for check in, we find out that our flight is cancelled. This airline is a nightmare and their customer service is horrible with wait times usually an 1+ hr.",-1

First of all I never review anything but this made me so fed up. They notified me at 3:01am after I had already gotten to the airport that my flight was cancelled to go back home. There were no other flights that date to go back home and out our a round trip ticket that I had paid $282 for, they only could refund me $87. Not to mention this is the second time I take this airline and it’s always the worst ride and most uncomfortable travel. Luggage is never included when you buy them either. Never again going to take this airline and I recommend nobody else does either. You’re far better off staying away from them. This was absolutely ridiculous and terrible.",-1

If you have any other option than Spirit Airlines go ahead and take it. Spirit is notorious for delays, overbooking and cancellations. When you actually get on the plane go ahead and pay extra for the wide seats upfront. Otherwise it will be uncomfortable. Value wise not worth it. You'd rather pay a little more for all the little things those other airlines provide.",-1

2019-08-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Houston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,flight was cancelled outright,False,"  After arriving at the airport at 11:00p Friday night, ready to board my overnight flight from Seattle to Houston, my flight was cancelled outright. The person representing Spirit airlines laughed at the outraged crowd of people who did not understand why they now had to either refund their ticket and find some other way to get to Texas (same day tickets were going for $500 from other airlines), or to wait until Tuesday for the next flight. All he had to say to confused and angry people (some missed a cruise, one woman was headed to Houston for a family medical emergency) was ""That's not how it works"". He refused all demands from the crowd to speak with his superior. Allegedly he was the superior and there was no one higher than him that could have helped. The real problem: Spirit claimed no responsibility for the cancellation. Even if the cancellation was out of their hands, they still accepted our money in exchange for the promise to transport us from one place to another. They offered no accommodations. I was the only lucky person that day; a single seat on a flight to Dallas opened up at the perfect moment, and I only had to spend 19 hours at the airport, instead of finding some place to go for three days. Think about that. 19 hours at an airport was incredibly lucky. You pay for spirit with money for half of the ticket, and you pay the other half with risk. Do not fly Spirit.",-1

Then when I called to complain for the time and money it cost me for a refund, they said she checked in too late when in fact she checked 2 hours early, long story short, they were full of excuses and refused to give me a refund for their blatant mistake of which they cared less. I will never book with Spirit Airlines again.",-1

If you call they instruct u to hang up and text for an immediate representative, the person on the other end just gathers info n let u know someone will text u back. So 6 hours later I get a text back asking my problem which I have to outline in text for the rep to not respond at all. Finally I get someone on the line who tells me they gone to transfer to a supervisor that connects to a line that says hold for 45 mins to 1 hour for a rep then the line disconnects. So I was forced to just sit in the airport with no resolution at all. The flight was so late I missed work! Spirit has no care or concern for its customers at all.",-1

I get to the airport at 5am just to find out my flight was canceled! The next available flight is 4 days from now and all that we were offered was a refund for the return flight only. No reimbursement for housing was offered. No options for another airline was offered. They did not offer to pay difference for extra costs for a different flight. Nothing! So now I sit waiting for my next flight with another airline that costs an additional $220 to purchase last minute! Thanks Spirit!,-1
2019-08-18,0.8,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Guatemala City via Ft. Lauderdale,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,solution-focused,False," Boston to Guatemala City via Ft. Lauderdale. A combination of weather challenges on the East Coast and other apparent technical problems meant canceled flights. I entered a line of over a hundred people with a handful indignant at the delays, cancelations and reschedule realities. Of the five to seven employees in Boston and then another handful in Lauderdale none at any point lost composure and all were solution-focused and continued working with customers. Given the emotions they faced I watched while I was in line with amazement at the consistency among the staff. My issues in Boston were managed so smoothly by the associate who just kept looking for the best options to reroute me. In Lauderdale it was parts in electronic systems and generally the staff thought to keep us informed of every step to resolve the problem. It is the tough days that reveal the character and your teams in Boston and Lauderdale excelled.",1
2019-08-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Dallas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit has done nothing,True,"  Philadelphia to Dallas. I had just buried my father in Philadelphia, the man who raised me, after booking a frantic series of flights back to the US to say goodbye. After the funeral, I said farewell to my family and wandered to the airport, purchasing a Spirit Airlines ticket, as my funds were nearly gone after the rush home. I should have forked over money to a more expensive airline and starved until my next paycheck. It would have been less stress, less rage and less continued neglect. Spirit canceled my flight, for the usual weather reasons, telling me that I had a window seat waiting for me on Wednesday to take me home to mourn among friends in Dallas. It was Sunday. When I pressed, the airline skimmed around with asinine sympathy, subtly trying to deflect the hoards of usual flight-goers. They told me that a flight would leave tomorrow morning from Atlantic City. They wouldn't pay for transport, food, or lodging. I gritted my teeth and made the trip, traveling for hours on my own dime until I slept next to the baggage claim at the small airport. I awoke at 4:30 in the morning to catch my flight, only to have a distraught security guard tell me this flight was canceled too. I was sleep deprived and livid. Pressing to the front desk, I was told ""Don't worry, we've got you a flight that leaves in a few hours."" It was in Philly. When the attendants looked at my expression, they quickly drew up a fifty dollar flight voucher to appease me. It was naturally rejected. I'll never fly Spirit again as long as I live. Since then, I've lodged complaints. I've bombarded the company with emails. I've called until I left the country or work, then borrowed a Google Voice Number to continue calling. Spirit has done nothing. Nothing. There's very little more wretched and less holy than Spirit Airlines.",-1
2019-08-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Montego Bay,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,airline is horrible,False," Baltimore to Montego Bay. This airline is horrible, I will never use them again. First time and last time flying with them. My husband and I flew with Spirit going to Jamaica. The flight was a hour and a half late departing and arriving. They didn't even try to accommodate any of us for the inconvenience. Then upon my departure from Jamaica, we sat on the plane for three hours and then we were told to get off the plane due to engine problems. The plane had engine problems going and coming from Jamaica. This was a huge inconvenience, it happened too many times. Then we couldn't go home when we were supposed to because the flight was cancelled. There was no staff for three hours at the MBJ airport. The staff had us go through customs and TSA all over again after our flight was cancelled. There was complete choas and confusion. I was not allowed or other flyers were not allowed water for three to four hours. Then each of us during that period of time were assigned to different hotels. I was unhappy and felt unsafe.",-1

Spirit is apologizing, but has yet to offer a refund for the money I will inevitably lose in gas, parking, lodging, pre-paid activities, and time. My trip to Canada is ruined! Spirit is by far the worst airline ever. There is no way they can remain in business with such poor reliability, aircraft, and customer service. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the airline.",-1
2019-08-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Baltimore Washington,,,,,,1.0,1.0,our flight is canceled,False,"  Jacksonville to Baltimore Washington. We had a flight booked for 5:20 yesterday evening on August 15th. We chose to fly with spirit despite its bad rep due to the fact that we wanted to get home faster than our family who was driving back. So much for that idea because instead of boarding our plane at 5:20 we sat in the airport for 8 hours waiting on a confirmation for our plane. At first it was delayed, then boarding was delayed. We waited and waited until they came up with the lame excuse that there was a maintenance problem and to top that off after 8 hours and at 11 o’clock at night we finally realize our flight is canceled and since it was so late we had no way to fly back. Our best bet was buying the next plane ticket out of here which was crazy expensive almost 600 dollars for two one ways. And we were only given 7 dollar vouchers? Any way at the same time we got the vouchers everything was already closed. So to say the least we will never fly with them again. They are also terribly uncomfortable.",-1
2019-08-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Philadelphia,,,,,,1.0,1.0,complete waste of time and money,True,"  Los Angeles to Philadelphia. In the afternoon we get a bunch of emails saying that our 11:00 pm flight got pushed back to 2:30 am, and then changed back to 1:00 am and then back to 2:30 am At 9:10 pm a new mail comes out saying that the flight got cancelled, so we checked online and it says “on time”, so we leave immediately to go to LAX. We get on the road and the eta to LAX is 55 minutes, boarding is at 10:15 and doors close at 10:50. We rush, almost get into a car accident, run through the terminals and check points and get stopped at security for bringing packaged boba but make it to our gate at 10:43 p.m. to the lady saying “your flight is cancelled, go back downstairs to the check-in to figure out what next flight is available” We walk down to the Spirit counter where they say next available flight is 12:20 am with a 3 hour layover flight in Chicago on United airlines. We take that option, and walk all the way to United where the United a-hole is on hold with spirit for 20 min and then says he has no record/no payment and more importantly that United does not do deals with Spirit, so sends us back to Spirit to figure out what the matter is. Spirit puts us on hold saying they have to call to “register us”, all the while more spirit customers are coming in and complaining with similar issues of cancelled/delayed flights and not being accepted on other airlines. We wait for another 30-40 min to at that point we missed our second flight on United. They gave no option to guarantee another flight within the next 24 hours. No apologies, all the employees were unprofessional and extremely unhelpful, even the managers were called in and did absolutely nothing. Multiples times while “waiting to figure things out” the employees would joke with one another and goof off behind the counter.  At that point, we just gave up, demanded a refund and drove home, empty handed with no tickets, no new flights and an empty weekend with no plans, having to explain to our family member who we were supposed to visit why we could no longer come. All in all, five hours on Thursday night August 16th we have realized what most Americans have known since they could walk, which is that Spirit is complete ass and is a complete waste of time and money.",-1

Spirit Airlines & JustFly charged my credit card $329.48 for a flight in someone else name. I did NOT book a flight in this name and disputed the charges with the CitiCard company within an hour of the credit card charge. All Spirit will do is offer a partial credit on a future flight in the next few months. Spirit has terrible customer service. JustFly represents Spirit and JustFly made a mistake. I caught the mistake quickly. This did not cause any inconvenience to Spirit and they should have taken care of this politely and apologetically but choose to cheat me out of $329.48.

My 18 year old son and two 17 year old friends were at Lagardia Airport in New York over three hours early and missed the flight due to a scanner problem at the airport. Spirit said the next flight would be today, 8/12/2019. Spirit said there was nothing they could do. The families had to get the boys a hotel. They made it to Lagardia four hours early and got on the plane. They sat on the plane for two and a half hours because of what they were told was a ""scratch"" on the plane. They said other passengers were so mad they demanded and actually got off the plane. Finally they departed and had to catch a connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale Florida. The original tickets we bought were for a non stop flight, but ""there is nothing we can do"", they said. Even though with the scratched airplane they made it to the gate 15 minutes before take off, Spirit told them they sold their seats to someone else, ""but don't worry, we booked you on another flight."" This will be another four hour wait. And ""there is nothing we can do"", they said. Six parents are extremely worried about their children. They were supposed to return home here near Dallas Texas on 8/10/2019 at about 5pm. It is now 8/12/2019 at 5pm and they are in Florida. They should be shut down.

Our flight was delayed because a young lady, her boyfriend, and her nieces were kicked off the flight for taking a picture together. The flight attendant accused the woman of taking pictures without consent and when she was informed that the man was her boyfriend and the children were their relatives the flight attendant became angry and embarrassed and had them removed from the flight. The children looked scared and confused and none of the staff showed any remorse. Even after that incident the staff was rude, miserable, and seemed as though they could care less about giving any effort to good customer service. It’s an absolute joke of an airline. Their cheap prices shouldn’t mean they can lack in decent employees who actually care about their jobs. Will never fly again. Kicking children off a flight for no reason is absolutely ridiculous and disgusting.",-1

My partner and I needed inexpensive flights for a business/birthday trip. We ended up flying on my partner’s birthday and it was unexpectedly pleasant! For a flight, long lines, crying babies, and frustrating delays are expected. What is not expected is the accommodations and kindness we experienced through our entire journey. Our flight ended up delaying 18 hours in Las Vegas. Even though we did want to get back to Texas, we weren’t in a huge hurry. They provided stay, transportation, and meal tickets from the airport. Everyone was very helpful and kind. I highly recommend this airline if you are looking for a cheap flight while you are not in a hurry to get to your destination.",1

2019-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Dallas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,stay away at all costs,True,"  New York to Dallas. My 18 year old and two 17 year olds were at Laguardia airport this morning over 3 hours before flight and the lines were very long. After 2 hours he spoke to Spirit who said nothing they could do. Then, they missed their flight and Spirit said next flight was in 48 hours and there was nothing they could do. They refused to talk to anyone else because my son was 18. I called Customer Service and explained three young travelers were stranded in New York. Their response was ""theres nothing we can do."" Three families had to scramble to find a place for these young boys to stay for 48 hours. Very cold responses from Spirit Airlines. I believe that it is true that there is nothing they can do, especially customer service. They are cheaper, but please, stay away at all costs.",-1

Before going through security there’s a Spirit agent at the entrance checking everyone’s bag to make sure the size requirements are met to be considered a personal item. Ours fit in the perfectly in the slot. At the boarding gate we lined up when they called our zone and as we approached the agent, one of them asked to see our boarding pass before the other agent scanned it. As I was speaking to the agent who was holding our passes, the other agent who was scanning the boarding passes started screaming at us to move out of the way. I was confused as to what was going on. I told them they already checked at the checkpoint, why do they need to make a huge scene with my family being pulled aside? The agent who finally scanned our boarding passes snatched them from me and spoke rudely under his breath as I told them they were rude. He then shoved them at me as I snatched them from him. This was a horrible experience for my kids to witness as I was forced to defend myself for appearing to be rude. There are ways to handle a situation like this and this was unnecessary.",-1

Dropped my husband and young child off at 6:30pm to catch a flight that left at 8:14pm. We got the first delay of 30 minutes at the time of board. No big deal, but then the next one put us out until 9:49pm. Then it would jump back to original time. This was on going back and forth for an hour until we reached 9:40pm. The flight then was delayed until 10:30pm. At 10:30pm we got another delay notice of 11:37pm. I was constantly in contact with my husband but at this time I called spirit. They said that it was weather related but since 8:30pm with no sign of a storm! My husband said they deplaned once at 9:49pm due to issues. They finally boarded second plane after 10pm. Went to depart at 10:30pm got to runway and the pilot comes on and says oops we’re low on fuel! How crazy is this. They go back fuel up and then people start fist fighting on board! I was on the phone when the pilot came on and said we now have the proper fuel “haha” everyone take a seat for take off. Totally not a “haha” moment! My husband and daughter sat at the airport for 5 hours before departing with no advanced notice of delays to which they couldn’t really leave the gate.  My husband had a connecting flight back to Baltimore. Which was suppose to land at 4:30am, so he could get to work on time. Now it’s pushed back to 7:30am leaving him late and missing wages! This is absolutely ridiculous!",-1

At this point not sure if I will be seated with my husband and toddler, to choose a seat you have to pay a fee, to bring a carry on you have to pay a fee to check it in. Just hoping and praying we will be lucky enough to stay together. Charged my husbands card three times for the carry on fees, because on our flight back we need to stop in Florida before we can get to Washington. Pretty much they try to get every penny out of you. Sadly only after we have already booked our trip, did we find out about all the unfortunate things about this airline.

2019-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Portland via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,an appalling experience,True,"  Atlanta to Portland via Las Vegas. My friend and I, both frequent travelers, faced an appalling experience with Spirit Airlines last week - by far the most horrific experience of customer service and communication I have experienced. We had flights booked from ATL to PDX (via LAS) to visit a friend. We were scheduled to fly out from ATL at noon on Aug. 3rd. At 10:04AM, we were notified that our flight was delayed 7hours, which would cause us to miss the second leg (LAS to PDX). Accordingly, we got on the phone with Spirit to try to resolve the situation. After an hour of waiting and being put on hold many times, we were able to speak to someone. She informed us that the only option was to take the same flight the following day but she only had one seat open. She told us she couldn't help us and our best bet would be to go to the airport and talk to the people there. We made the 30 minute drive to the airport. Ended up booking a Spirit flight, ATL to DEN, departing at 10PM the same day. We booked a separate flight through Frontier, DEN to PDX, departing at 7AM the following day. Don't know why that required a trip to the airport and couldn't be done over the phone but that's besides the point. We arrive at the airport for the second time that day hours before our flight. We see on the flight information display system that our flight (771) has been delayed until 11:45PM (photo attached). Not a problem considering we had a 7hour layover. We still got to the gate hours early and sat there and waited 1-2hours, never leaving the premises. I was wary since the screen at the gate only said ""DELAYED"" with no time given. So 15 minutes before our original departure time, I got up to check with the representatives only to be informed that our flight to Denver had already left?? 15 minutes before departure time and nearly 2hours before the time clearly stated (however misleading and obviously wrong) on the flight information display system?? We were in shock. And it was not just us. There was a group of ~12 other passengers, some on our flight, others flying to other cities, who had also missed their flight. Normally airlines announce boarding many times, even calling out passenger names if they weren't present. But nope. We got nothing. My friend and I, both frequent flyers, were at the right gate hours early, paying vigilant attention the whole time, and somehow we missed our flight. There were 6 employees behind the counter, some typing slowly while staring blankly at the screen, some pacing, others nervously exchanging glances. After an hour of waiting to speak to someone, he tried to place the blame on us for missing the flight. They were rude and unapologetic, offering no form of refund/compensation. While my friend and I were traveling for leisure, some of the other passengers weren't. A college-aged girl who didn't call Atlanta home was sobbing because she couldn't afford a hotel room. A man was defeated because he ""had a 92-year old waiting on him."" The representatives behind the counter were slow, unhelpful, and offered no form of human empathy. We left the airport at 12AM after spending 15 hours trying to be patient with Spirit employees. We ended up cancelling the return flight and our entire vacation. I've flown low-cost airlines before (Transavia, Royal Air Maroc, JetBlue just to name a few) and I know you get what you pay for. But never have I had a bad experience, not to mention such an abominable, hair-raising one.",-1

Cancelled flight based on what was called an act of God. The gate attendant would not specify how it was sunny and warm in both Tampa and San Juan what constitutes an act of God.

So while in line, I also called the customer service phone number, and texted 48763 for help. I was on hold for over 15 minutes twice, and then hung up on without ever speaking with anyone! I was able to get a hold of a rep through text who asked me if I wanted a refund-or to be rebooked on an available flight August 1st at 6AM. I immediately texted back that I would like to be rebooked on the 6AM flight August 1st. The Rep did not respond to my text for at least 20 minutes. Then the Rep texted back that the 6AM August 1st flight was already full-and the next flight wouldn’t leave until Friday, August 2nd. I texted the rep back stating if he/she had responded to me right after I confirmed I would like to be rebooked on the 6AM August 1st flight, I would’ve been satisfied with that option. Therefore, I ended up having to book a flight with another airline, pay for an unexpected hotel stay at BWI, as well as forfeit a rental car and hotel that we was already booked and paid for at my destination! I understand having to cancel the flight because of weather, however the lack of customer service and general concern for your customers was appalling! I am a business owner, as well as have been a member of the $9 club for a while, taking many flights with Spirit. After this terrible experience, I cannot foresee going through this ever again with this company!",-1

I have flown on Spirit Airlines only twice and the last time was an emergency. Beware! When you think you are getting a cheaper flight think again. By the time they get you in carry on fees and seats. The ticket will probably be the same to fly a safer airline. When I say safer, I'm referring to the super thin seats and skimpy materials used to make the plane. I also supposedly won 5,000 free miles for sitting in the ""lucky seat."" However when I went to redeem them. It was ""already used"" I asked to speak to a manager who said there was nothing she could do. The only person who could have used my free miles is the flight attendant who handed me the voucher. All around the worst airline. It may be cheaper but it's not worth it.",-1

A lot of people that fly on budget airlines dont understand the saying ""You get what you pay for"". I've flown on multiple ultra low cost carriers such as Swoop, Allegiant, and Spirit, none have disappointed me. I even see people here on Skytrax complaining that their $29 flight got delayed, said the seats and value was good, but still gave all 1 stars and a 1/10. Now, onto the review. The ground crew were friendly, boarded the plane and the seat was average. The seatback pockets are a joke, just a couple bungee cords. The flight was very worth it, it was only 49.99 per person one way. The cabin crew were also friendly. Food was expensive, so asked for a cup of ice. Flight arrived early at McCarran Intl.",1

Delayed over two hours, then departure said 9:18pm, but still didn’t depart until nearly 10pm, which may have been excusable if the care or pilot did anything at all to communicate the reason for the extra 45 minute delay. They didn’t. We just sat there in the plane in silence. Then, they say we’ll make up some time in the air. We didn’t. We arrived way later than even the most delayed info they provided. Absolutely horrible. They were slow and silent about every aspect of the trip. Won’t ever be flying Spirit again.",-1

I flew from Dallas to Atlanta then Atlanta back to Dallas. I missed my flight and spent my last few dollars on gas money. I went to the front desk and waited for a half an hour or more to speak to a manager to explain my situation, which they said they ""could not help me"". I finally had to go to their baggage claim office where the lady was nice and gave me some money out of her own pocket. This lady was a godsend compared to the other employees who had attitudes and did not care. I will avoid flying at Spirit Airlines again, they by far are the worst I've ever dealt with.",-1

I showed up on time 5:55 but since the agent was talking on the phone talking to her kid she couldn't be bothered with customers. Finally, when she hung up and ""helped"" the three customers in front of me so much time had passed that she told me the flight was closed, although there was still 35 minutes before the flight left. So I paid the $99 to book on the next flight at 7:25. So I go through TSA and all the mess just to find out that the flight was not leaving at 7:25 am, but pm. I went back to the counter and instead of calling the manager like I asked, they called security. I guess that is the way they fix problems at Spirit Airlines. I demanded my money back and rebooked on Southwest.",-1

Our initial departure time was 10:57 PM and the delays kept continuing little by little until after 5:15 AM. The passengers were not apprised of any details. Had we known more, we could have rented a car and driven home. Instead, my girlfriend and I missed time at work. Two separate $50 vouchers to fly Spirit again is far from a resolution and is insulting. This whole experience was absolutely horrendous. I have no desire to fly Spirit again and risk what we lost last night. With their deceptive pricing strategy that tacks on cost of bags and seats, the lack of amenities, and discomfort, it ends up being more costly and doesn’t compare to other airlines’ product. Unless they’re the only option, there is no reason to fly with Spirit.",-1

My first flight got canceled after being delayed 4 hours. Imagine being in an airport with two children for 6 hours then being told you aren’t going to your destination in time for your family reunion. I was rescheduled for two days later. Then on the flight back we had a lay over that also got delayed in Las Vegas, for 4 hours. This seems like more than a coincidence. Beyond this, the customer service  sucks. There are no counter clerks the seats are packed in with no cushion and no lean back features. There are also no free drinks. Everything is a price, including the $55 per person luggage charge, or picking your seat (forget sitting with your family). I hate this airline and will never subject my family to this ever again. I may look like a deal up front but they will ruin your trip and it’s not cheaper in the least. I’m only giving this airline a 1 because I can’t do less.",-1

The staff was extremely unprofessional and rude, they did our check-in while chewing gum loudly and laughing with their collegues. The staff and other personnel member was also very discourteous and lacked any basic notion of customer service. And right before barding the plane, I am pulled aside and taxed 65 USD because of my cabin luggage which, according to them, was too big to put under the seat and had to be put in the luggage bin, which was chargeable.  The Spirit Airlines representative also told me very kindly that I was free to leave my luggage in the airport if I refused to pay. I have never seen an airline company charge you for using the luggage bin in the cabin. Worst, I talked to some people in the plane and learnt that some of them put their luggage in the bin but didnt pay that extra charge.  It is scandalous that I was not informed about this at the check-in (the agent was too busy laughing with her collegues I guess) and ambushed right before boarding the plane.",-1

Things didn’t turn ugly until they cancelled my last flight out of 5 total for no legitimate reason. They claimed it was cancelled due to weather however no other flights were cancelled to Minneapolis that day on other airlines. I even checked the radar and there wasn’t even rain on it. They had no accommodations except to put me on a flight the next day 24 hours later. It was extremely difficult to get ahold of customer service to try sort things out. Communication was horrible and customer service was horrible as well. As a single mother who needed to get home to her children and job asap, this was a horrible situation and extremely stressful. I will not be using Spirit Airlines ever again. I’d rather pay a little more for reliability, good communication and good customer service.",-1

Would not recommend this to anyone ever. It is ridiculous the way they charge for everything possible. They sell you by making it “appear” it’s a deal and then send you tons of emails about all the extras you must purchase just to get your luggage and have a seat on the plane.

They will screw you of any money they can. Our Flights needed to be changed due to a hurricane. So we changed location. The airline wouldn’t  refund our change fee (due to circumstances out of our control). I was informed it’s not in their policy. We still got our flight and we made to pay the extra.

To make matters worse I seen an old lady that didn’t speak any English on a wheel chair waiting for her flight that was canceled at 6pm, lucky I spoke her language and got her assistance which again spirit messed up I gave the lovely lady 40$ so she can get a bite to eat because she has been waiting for a flight that was canceled 7 hours ago and no one to assist her.",1

We were not offered any water or beverages and snacks unless we agreed to purchase. When the plane landed at LAX, we were told to close the window shades because they didn't know where the plane was going. What? What does that mean? I kept my shade open. Overall, it was not a pleasant experience and I will never ever fly Spirit again.",-1

I fly all the time, and this was my first and last flight with Spirit Airlines. Never again. Terrible customer service experience, impossible to check in online, the app it is a joke, the planes are about as luxurious as a 20-year-old school bus, the seats are microscopic and don’t even recline an inch, they charge you for everything down to a water.I did not purchase this ticket because it was cheap, but because the timing worked. I will go out of my way to make sure I never have to fly Spirit again. The only good thing I can say is that the flight attendants were friendly and sympathetic to the fact that I was squished into my seat next to a man at least five times larger than me.",-1
2019-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Newark via Myrtle Beach,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This is the worst company,True,"  This is the worst company. I bought a ticket from Columbus to Newark with a stop at Myrtle Beach Airport. I was supposed to be in NJ the same day at 7pm. At my arrival at Myrtle Beach Airport around 4pm, I was told that my second flight had been cancelled, and I had only two options. First option: I wait until Tomorrow 4pm to take the next flight with spirit with no guarantee to be on the flight, I have to stay in line with many other unfortunate passengers to figure out if I will get a place on this flight. Second option: I book my own flight with another company and get a reimbursement with spirit, but spirit won’t pay for the difference in price and will only reimburse my flight from Myrtle to NJ (the cancel one). In fact they told me I have already traveled from Columbus so it’s on me. I was flabbergasted, like I never asked to come to Myrtle Beach at the first place. And on top of that they don’t provide us with any accommodation. I am stuck in middle of nowhere and I don’t know where to sleep. They said the flight had been canceled because of the weather but other companies were flying to New York. I ended up buying another flight with another company for the next day for 60$ more than what I paid with spirit at the first place and paid for an hotel room. So, thinking of making savings, I ended up spending more and miss one day of work. So to the question if I recommend Spirit airline I think my story say it all.",-1

They canceled my flight 3 hours before departure because of weather according to them, which I’m sure that was not true. In addition to that when I called they refused to send me to a different airport because it would be more expensive and refused to refund me my hotel loss for that night. On my way back from Charlotte to Tampa with a 45 minutes layover in Fort Lauderdale the airplane was delayed again in Fort Lauderdale due to weather storm according to them and 2 hours later they said they were missing a flight attendant and couldn’t depart until they could find a replacement. This was outrageous. My eta home (Tampa) is now 4 am. I will never ever again book a flight with spirits!",-1

Then on my trip back from Minneapolis, I was happy to see that the flight was on time and we might even arrive a little early. I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up. Once we are boarded in the plane, an announcement was made that there is extra flight traffic heading east and that the plane has to return to the terminal to refuel. Are you kidding me?! No one could figure out to refuel the plane while an entire load of passengers got off and another boarded? No they would rather just make a plane full of people wait for no reason other than they can’t get their act together.",-1

Just pay the extra money for a better airline. I have never met more rude, inconsiderate, and mean spirited employees. My boyfriend, who had never flown before, was attempting to attach our tag to our bag when a Spirit employee ripped it out of his hand and yelled “NO”. So that should’ve been a sign. We were then talked down to by EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE we encountered. I work customer service, I know it can be draining, but I always treat people like I would want to be treated. None of these people should be working with the public. Not to mention the comically uncomfortable seats. The one in front of me was caked with chewed bubblegum. I’m 5’7” and my boyfriend is 6’3” and we had to sit sideways. The icing on the cake was one of our flight attendants basically yelling having a conversation with a coworker the entire flight. Takeoff was around midnight and we arrived at around 6:00 am, so middle of the night for the passengers. Delayed several times, moved gates several times.",-1

Arrived at the airport about 4 hours before my scheduled departure time. After paying an insane amount of money to checked in 3 pieces of luggage and a carry-on bag made our way to the gate and patiently waited across from the gate 34 area until about 1 hour before departure I realized there was a different flight number/destination posted at the gate screen. Went to the gate when was told the gate have been changed to gate 24, which is at a totally different terminal and without asking or looking around me and my family made our way to gate 24 as we were told (I take the blame for this, should have questioned the terminal change fact with the airline employee, but I didn't...this was one is on me). Arrived at the new gate about 20 minutes later just to be told the gate was 31 and not 24 as we were informed, but little did we know that to get back to the gate 31 area we needed to go through security again, which at that point was taking about 30 minutes. Long story short, we missed our flight, they offered to put us on the next flight 7 hours later (This flight was delayed by 1 hour and the departure gate was change twice). I am still don't know how I kept it together and didn't get myself arrested after this debacle. This was my first and last time I ever use this airline.",-1

Warning: it's cheap, you won't see how miserable until you face Spirit Airlines cancel their flight. I have been flying with Spirit Airlines to work every week for about a year. I noticed recently about Spirit Airline cancelled their flights every day in different states. So, the customers get stranded, and you pay a higher price with Spirit. Let's say, you plan to go to your vacation. Spirit Airlines ticket sells for $189.00 and other airline ticket prices $320.00. Then, Spirit cancels their flight and inform you about mechanical issue or weather on the destination within 3 hours the day you fly. What's happening when you are looking to purchased airline ticket to fly-out today or next day, the ticket price marked up 70% or 80%. Spirit will not move or put you on the next day for free.

There is always some issue with the flights and it is always blamed on the weather so that you can’t ask any further questions. Today (7/19), my flight to Baltimore via Detroit was cancelled, again stating weather. On my last trip, returning to Oakland from Baltimore via Detroit, on reaching Detroit, I was told my flight to Oakland had already left, leaving me stranded in Detroit for the night. They gave me a voucher for some discount on hotels but the customer service for that discount was awful. They put me on hold for 30 mins and then hung up on me. I was enraged. Even worse was for families on the same flight as me who were headed to Dallas via Detroit, were told the next flight available to them would be on Tuesday, it was Saturday night when this happened. That poor family with 3 kids were told they had to stay in Detroit for 3 days for no reason whatsoever. I’m tired of this airline and even though I have many points/miles gathered up in my account, I am willing to forsake them and never fly this Spirit Airlines again.",-1

We arrived at the airport at 9:50 and was at the correct terminal on time. Went to the counter to confirm with customer service that the flight was leaving on time, only to be shewed off and told that we were in the right terminal. We did not receive the correct information from staff, and later found out the the flight was then moved back to the correct time and the terminal was changed. We did not receive notification until the time the plane was taking off, and to make matters worse my check bag was on the flight. Customer service was more concern about getting off work than helping customers.",-1

Not only was my flight delayed from Cancun 3 hours, due to “weather”, the staff were not helpful at all. I witness them provide several different customers with different information regarding the status of the flight. My flight was originally scheduled to take off at 4:09pm, it didn’t leave until almost 6:30pm and arrived in FT Lauderdale at 9:00pm. I had a lay over that was scheduled to leave FT Lauderdale at 10:03pm on the same aircraft heading to New York. We had to go through customs, immigration, baggage claim, recheck baggage and TSA. Oh and not mention it took 30 minutes for our bags to reach baggage claim. Moving along, you would think the airline would notify all connecting flights that all passengers on this flight were delayed so that the flights could potentially be held. NOPE! Didn’t happen. The entire flight missed their connecting flights. And to add insult to injury, the staff that was assisting with rebooking was atrocious! No one showed concern for the inconvenience that was caused, a representative told a family of 8 that half of them could take a flight the next day and the other half will take take a flight the day after. To make matters worse, this disgusting airline didn’t even offer room accommodations for those passengers stuck over 12hrs. My wife and I had to rebook two separate flights, one at 7am and the other at 8pm. There were children so young as the age of months old forced to sleep in the airport for over 16hrs due to the next available flight not being until the day after.",-1

My email inbox is full of update for time change, gate change. What in the world passengers have to suffer? And yet they are so quick in charging passengers if they don’t check in online, luggage etc. On flight 805 today, departure time was change 10 times! Who does this? Of course Spirit Airlines!

My friend had booked our tickets to Nicaragua in late June. I had to cancel because of a family emergency but he was able to go. I called the airline to see if I could get a partial refund and was directed to their help website, where I cancelled my return. I received an email with a voucher. I had no use for the voucher but I let it go and decided to absorb the cost. A couple of weeks later, on the day of his return back to the States, my friend was told at 1:00 a.m. that his ticket had been cancelled. He had to buy another ticket, more expensive than the original round-trip ticket. There is no one at Spirit that will help. They keep directing us to the same website that got us in this mess in the first place. I would it give 0 stars if I could. Never again will I fly Spirit.",-1

2019-07-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Neveda,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the staff was so rude,True,"  First time flying with Spirit, and definitely the last. We already had booked this long adventure to SD CA to Boston MA, leaving in the morning from SD to Detroit Michigan and had a layover of 12 hours before heading to Boston. OK fine, we made the best out of it. Flight there was mediocre, not too bad. So I’m writing this review as we’re waiting for a gate into Nevada airport after already having more than an hour delay in Boston. So at Logan airport we were notified that are 8:04 pm flight was delayed until 8:48 pm, but we didn’t board the flight until after 9 with no explanations just saying they were late and still cleaning. When I get on the staff was so rude. I walked all the way to the back to use the restroom and the two women glared at me trying to open the door, I thought it was locked but it was vacant not realizing as she scoffed “um its vacant and open..” like I was stupid. She could of been a lot nicer about it. None of the employees were smiling or greeting and then too top it off one of the pilots who spoke at the beginning of the flight was out talking in the front of the plane with a flight attendant for about 20 minutes. We sat the 6th row so I could see everything. While the other flight attend was in the front of the plane with the other pilot. Never seen anything like that in my years of flying. Made me feel really unsafe and concerned about the rest of the passengers. The staff just seemed not to care about their jobs or the passengers on the plane. I just think it’s unprofessional of the pilot to be talking with the flight attend in the front of the plane.. blocking the bathroom. Then having the other flight attend in the front, just odd? So my final problem is that we’re here in Nevada and instead of getting off the plane we are sitting here waiting for something to open for us to get off because everything is delayed apparently. It’s been over a half hour and we’re still sitting here waiting for a terminal to open!",-1

Staff at Washington Baltimore airport extremely unfriendly and unprofessional. Took them over 3.5 hr to give me a hotel for the night and ended up giving me a 2.5 star hotel. I asked to speak to supervisor and was told by 3 staff members that she will be out to talk to me and I ended up leaving the airport after waiting for her for over 30 minutes without her showing up. My flight was scheduled at 1440 and ended up in the hotel around 9 pm! Completely unprofessional.

I just so happen to check my emails as my kids were preparing to leave for the airport when I noticed a cancellation notification from Spirit 4 hours before my flight. After calling their help desk I was told the earliest they can fly me back was 2 days later which meant I’d have to stay at the hotel 2 more nights, incur more expenses - traveling with kids means feeding them but I guess Spirit isn’t family oriented or just doesn’t care. Oh, and I’d also have to miss 2 days of work. I declined and received a partial refund towards the flight back. Because Spirit’s only option was to leave me and my young children stranded in Atlanta I was forced to pay $1057 to fly Delta to return home. The customer service rep was unapologetic and offered no compensation towards my troubles, inconvenience and other financial burden. I will never fly Spirit again! They lost a customer for life.",-1

They sent me 7 emails throughout departure day saying that my flight was delayed more and more. It was delayed from 9.30pm to 12.40am (3 hrs)! When it came to be 9.00 they then sent another email that they moved the time back up to 10.40. So not only did I only have 1.5 hrs to get the rental car back, get multiple shuttles, check my bag, and go through security but when I got to the terminal, the plane left 30 minutes before posted departure times (10.10)! I got there at 10.18 and all representatives were very rude and disrespectful about missing the flight! They never said sorry, provided transportation/lodging, or a refund. The “only thing they could do” was get me on a flight in 2 days back to Denver. I had to sleep in the airport and buy another flight with Southwest to get home. I will never fly with Spirit again and make sure that everyone I know does not either.",-1

So many things to say about spirit, but a compliment isn’t one of them. Everything in Spirit has to be paid, 3 hour flight, you have to pay for water. Most airlines give it to you for free, considering I spent $300 on a flight and I can’t get a water cup. Along with that, carry on bags are all charged and they are overpriced. I was charged $65 for my carryon today, and I had to accept it or I wouldn’t have been able to board. Now I understand Spirit is the cheaper option but $50 less is not worth it. The seats are uncomfortable, workers are rude, and overall just had a terrible experience. Conclusion: don’t go with spirit.",-1

I arrive at the airport for them only to delay the flight again. I asked for a pass to take my son to the terminal because I didn’t want my 15 year old sitting in the terminal to midnight by himself. They denied me that peace of mind. Then as I’m getting in my car after leaving him alone at the airport they cancel the flight. I go back in to get him but guess what they don’t tell any of the passengers where to get there luggage or when and how we should reschedule. Top it off the extremely inept lacking common sense staff at Spirit don’t have the intelligence to put someone out in front of the counter to tell us where are luggage went.. We all sat there in line for for an hour to ask the simple question , where is my luggage? Unbelievable! The only thing Spirit did right is not send the plane up in bad weather.

Well, after being left stranded in Orlando due to rain, Spirit was unwilling to find me an alternate flight home, only 2 days later. Would not offer accommodations, full refund, nothing. I ended up having to book with another airline, last minute so we know how that can be costly. I got a 200 refund. My flight was double that, plus extra baggage fees. I was given a 100 voucher to fly Spirit in the future which will never happen. Waiting in airport til next morning was torture. Oh and the 4hrs being stuck in customers due to rain was ridiculous as well. Thanks for the 2 crackers and hot baby bottle of water.

2019-07-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Detroit via Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,skateboard posed a risk,True,"  My wife, daughter and I Left Out of Oakland CA airport on Spirit flight #188 today July 9, 2019 at 6am. We arrived in Las Vegas where we were to deboard, wait and get back on the plane to Detroit on an 8:22 am flight (same flight) NK188. My daughter had her skateboard we bought her as a birthday present earlier on this trip. Unfortunately we were not given the option to leave the skateboard on the plane. We had the same seats on both flights. This was the 3rd flight on this long trip she would carry it on. There were no comments or questions on the previous flights. In fact, we asked at the counter when checking in and were told it would not be a problem. They were right. We had no problem flying in to San Francisco earlier, or at the check in or gate in Oakland today. We didn’t try to hide anything. We were forthright and the skateboard was clearly present and in the open. However, when attempting to board the connecting flight in Las Vegas, we were told it would be $65 and we would have to check it under the plane since the skateboard posed a risk management hazard. “Skateboards are not allowed on our planes. They pose a hazardous risk!” I asked to speak to a supervisor who was finally at the 4th gate I was redirected to by the inept staff. She indicated the fee was only $55 and, yes, the skateboard needed to be checked under the plane since it posed a hazard and would not be allowed on the plane. We were never asked to put the skateboard in the “Bin of Magnitude” they didn’t see if it could have been folded in half to fit in the smallest no fee personal item. I went back to our departure gate and grudgingly paid the $55. While preparing my phone to photograph the stern rule/fee wielding gate attendant, she informed me I was not allowed to take her photograph. She also blocked her name tag so I couldn’t notate who I was communicating with. She indicated that if I argued with her about photographing her she would call security on me (and that can’t be good). Furthermore, with seats that dont recline, a cross country flight in Spirit borders on unbearable, regardless of the supposed value. After paying the fee we walked to the gate and were allowed to carry the skateboard onto the plane with no questions asked. The same ladies at the gate who stopped us from carrying it on because it posed an imminent hazard if carried on the plane now told us to have a nice flight and made No motions or requests to check the skateboard my daughter was carrying as luggage. The flight crew greeted us at the door to the plane and helped us find a spot to put the skateboard in the storage bin above our seats. We were ultimately given free reign to carry our “Hazardous” item onto the plane now that it was paid for. Like trying to quit a bad habit, I have been done flying with Spirit before but their initial rates are so attractive it seems like such a value. The way they jack you and skew you and screw you with fees at every opportunity is how they get you and ultimately get you to pay",-1

I usually use Spirit as my regular airline but after this trip, I will not use them anymore. My flight was scheduled to leave Latrobe Airport at 3:40pm flying to Myrtle Beach, SC. I received an email saying the flight was delayed until 6:30pm which was fine. Then it kept getting delayed and delayed. 7:00, 7:25, 7:15, then 7:50. So I sat around waiting. Then the plane arrived so I thought we were finally heading out. Sat around, not knowing what was going on and no one told us what was going on. Workers were on the phone, running around and it didn’t seem like they knew what was going on either. Finally, the flight was canceled around 8-8:30. After waiting all day. Apparently, the crew had “timed out” and there was no staff to work the flight. Then they tell us to go up to the desk to make arrangements and there were 50-60 people in line and two workers. Latrobe is a small airport so I understand there were not many people there to work. They gave us a number to call so I called and got my flight rescheduled for the next day but the man on the phone said he could not help me with hotel accommodations. I live in North Carolina and was not close to any family to pick me up. So I made my own arrangements and then found out there was a line at the Spirit desk for hotel vouchers. I stood in line for a long time and my shuttle came to get me so I did not get to speak to anyone about a hotel voucher because I was not waiting at the airport anymore. By the time I got to the hotel, it was almost 11:30. It was so chaotic and frustrating. I had to spend my own money on mistakes that were Spirits fault. I also had to pay for an extra day of parking at Myrtle Beach Airport. It was terrible. Terrible and I am so upset with Spirit.",-1
2019-07-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,lack of any customer service,False,"  Never again. They cancelled (“the crew didn’t arrive”) our flight out of Plattsburgh NY Sunday morning July 7th, by email. We were in the mountains with no good internet access. We got to the airport before we realized and when we called to rebook they said everything was booked till Thursday. My wife found a flight leaving the next day that would require us to drive 6 hrs. We made the trip (Rental car and hotel stay) to Hartford CT for a 10:30 am flight Monday July 8th. That flight was delayed till 2:45 because of mechanical issues. The customer service was horrible. We finally landed (after a very very turbulent flight) a little after 4 and had to stay in the plane till 5 because the airport wasn’t ready for us. The crew was rude to customers having to use the bathroom (including our son) when the plane was sitting on the tarmac. The flight was so bumpy and the issues with cancellations/delays and lack of any customer service makes this the last time this family of 5 will ever travel Spirit. Our cheap tickets cost a rental car, hotel stay, food and extra boarding days for a pet.",-1

After driving 3 hours to airport, my daughter learned that the flight had been cancelled. My grandson was placed on another red-eye flight from Denver to Atlanta with a connection in Ft. Lauderdale. This flight arrived too late for the connection. Spirit then could not get him on the next flight to Atlanta nor can they give him any information on when they can fly him out over the next 24 hours. This airline has left a minor (with little travel experience) in an airport thousands of miles without his parents, no food coupons, no hotel, nothing. They have just abandoned him. This is horrible. His mother and father can get no information from the airline.",-1
2019-07-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Richmond to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Spirit was just bad,False,"  Atrocious. I mean, literally the most difficult excursion I have ever embarked on. I took a deal through a travel agency that encompassed Delta to get to Virginia and Spirit to get back. Delta was easy. On the plane, off the plane, I ever got in a little early! Accommodated drinks and allowed me to check a bag for free. Spirit was just bad. My flight originally planned for 6.22, was delayed to 9.24. Not great, but it happens. Then it was “delayed” until 9 am. They were willing to give a refund, but they were the only flight going to Florida. When asked if they would put me up in the cheapest hotel in the area, I was told, “no.” Ok then great. Once I get to the airport in the morning after paying for my own hotel. My flight was pushed back to 10.20 am. I fly two or three times a month, and often with Spirit because my trips are short and they tend to have affordable fare and good flight times. I will not be flying with them again.",-1
2019-07-09,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Orlando via Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,do not care about customer service,True,"  
Sacramento to Orlando via Las Vegas. Booked a flight via a reseller to take my son on a father-son trip to Florida. I have never flown Spirit before but made the mistake of thinking most airlines processes were similar. Chose Spirit mainly based on price an options. When I figured out Spirit'S prices were good I attempted to buy direct instead of the third party. Direct prices would have almost doubled my ticket price so I stuck with third party. After booking I was told I could check in and choose my seat 24 hours ahead of leaving. I waited and got an email telling me I was able to check in. I logged on only to find out the seat I wanted to select came with a cost, as much as $44 and if I wanted to carry on a bag it would also be $45 for me and my son. I bit the bullet and paid for both. When our trip was over we attempted to change flights to an earlier one because we were flying cross country. I was told for a small fee I could change. That small fee ended being more than the cost of our original tickets. Prior to trying to change flights I found out there were plenty of seats on the flights I tried to change to. We skipped that and went with our original tickets. I once again tried to check in online for our return flight. The website kept erring and didn’t allow me to check in. We arrived at the airport early as to avoid problems and the self check-in kiosk would not work either forcing us to go to a counter and get actual human help at which time we were told there was an additional fee for not using kiosk which we could not use, oh and no way for her to wave it. In general the planes were clean and comfortable. The attendants were friendly and courteous. Spirit's prices are very misleading. They do not really seem to care about customer service or customer satisfaction. When errors were clearly caused by their system they did apologize but still forced me to pay their extra fees. I fly a couple times a year and after this experience it’s highly unlikely I would ever use Spirit again. I cannot recommend friends or family using them either. In general I believe you get what you pay for. With Spirit, it looks like you pay a little but actually pay a lot. With Spirit, that lot you pay gets you very little.",-1
2019-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Washington,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,absolute lack of customer service,True,"  We paid extra money last minute to fly out to see family who happened to be in the country during the 4th of July week. We hadn't expected to travel and paid 3x the normal cost to fly out east last minute for family we rarely ever see. Spirit cancelled our return flight just a couple hours before departure. We only got an email (no call or text) which we were lucky enough to see before heading to the airport. We run our own business and had to be back home by Monday morning. Since they cancelled our Sunday night flight, we assumed they would make an effort to help us find the earliest departure- not the case. We were given a ""replacement"" flight Monday night. Our business will have to close all day Monday which will cost us to forfeit money on contracts we were supposed to do work on Monday. I was offered a scripted apology which meant nothing as they made no efforts to try and find us an earlier flight. They delayed our family 24 hours and cost our business and livelihood hundreds! We were ""not allowed any compensation"" because Spirit had flights in bad weather- it was out of Spirit's control. I understand weather. I understand delays and cancellations, but I do NOT understand an absolute lack of customer service to confront issues and help make amends to any degree with me as a customer. They were not willing to put us on flights earlier with any other airline to help us get home as soon as possible. They would not pay the cost difference to have us fly another airline. They couldn't refund us or credit us soon enough to be able to apply that credit towards another flight. Incredibly poor experience from the notification of the cancellation, 1.5 hours on the phone to speak with someone, no help, and no customer service in helping make things right for us. They will neverearn our business again within our family or circle of friends and especially not for our company or any clients.",-1

I was travelling with a group of 8 kids to go for a camp and purchased the carry-on luggage for each kid. My husband who was didn’t have carry-on luggage was helping the small ones with their luggage and was boarded behind. He was asked to pay for 2 luggage he’s carrying. I insisted that those are prepaid and belong to the kids. The staff was not convinced and would not listen to our explanation. I even suggested that we can get the kids out to verify it. They refused to do it. I ended up paying again for $65 each of the luggage. It’s my first time to take the Spirit Airline and will try to avoid taking this again.,-1
2019-07-07,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Orlando,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,my luggage was a total disaster,True,"  I am going to be very fair to Spirit Airlines since my flight yesterday from Houston to Orlando was delayed for almost two and a half hours and that was the weather back in Orlando. The staff were very helpful and supportive and gave as much updated information needed to make the necessary readjustments, needed to wait until weather finally cleared back in Orlando. The professionalism, courtesy and flight that was very much affected by the delays went very smoothly and kudos to the captain and first officer for a very smooth flight. Now the disappointments: the counter at Houston needs some major upgrades as far as dropping the bags, it was a real nightmares, people didn’t know what line to go to and there were long lines just to drop bags, but then the kiosks didn’t help since you get the tag and stay in the line but because the sign was barely legible others like me went to the wrong side (assistance clients) instead of bags dropped. That was the problem, peole got very confused and went to the assistance versus the drop of bags and that’s how the line grow up exponentially. They need to coordinate better and add more bag drop personnel ready to take care of bags (there were only two) and less assistance. Second: my luggage was a total disaster, dirty and wet. I was dumbfounded that my luggage had never experienced such hardships not even when I travel to Europe.",1

2019-07-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1.0,total lack of customer service,True,"  Don't even get what you pay for. My wife and 5 year old grand daughter was scheduled to fly Baltimore to Chicago on July 02, 2019. Her 10:00 PM flight was cancelled after a two hour delay, allegedly due to weather. They lie a simple check verified that other airlines flights from the same airport to the same designation were taking off and landing just fine. Meaning it had to be a plane or a staffing issue. Of course no offer of a hotel and no available flights until 10::00 PM on July 04, 2019. Guess what that flight was cancelled an hour and a half before takeoff again allegedly due to weather. Again they lied. I was able to book her a last min flight on Southwest, again same designation and a whopping 15 min alleged difference in take off times and her SW flight was delayed about 35 min (the weather passed). Of course we got hosed on the price, but that's expected when you book a flight an hour before scheduled take off.  Weather happens I get it, planes need maintenance, I get it, but if other airlines are flying no problem for two Spirit cancellations, clearly they lie it wasn't the weather. Guessing it's better to lie than to do the right thing and maybe tell the truth and pick up a hotel and the difference in cost for last minute tickets on an airline who's planes actually fly. I did ask their customer service which was also awful and the party line was weather related too bad so sad. I would agree if other flights were unaffected by the weather that caused Sprit to cancel, but when there is 100% conclusive evidence that it's not due to weather don't lie to save a buck. Save yourself the grief and avoid Sprit, not worth saving a couple of bucks to deal with lies, a total lack of customer service and a complete failure to do the right thing for their customers. My guess they won't be around too much longer, without customer loyalty, they will wither and die, too bad for the decent Spirit employees of which I'm sure there are many.",-1

Almost lost my job due to the negligence of the employees and representatives. Delayed and cancelled my flight and didn’t even give me the option to book another one until 2 days later! I spent 7 hours at the airport for nothing. Refused to try to put me into another airline for their mistake and gave me unreasonable options to accommodate me. It’s better to pay the extra money to ensure you will arrive to your destination on time and not stranded at an airport. They honestly need to shut this airline down. They do not care for the well being of their passengers at all.,-1
2019-07-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Austin,,,,,,,1.0,I basically wasted money,True,"  I booked a flight for my daughter and I which was already $400. When I went to add our seats I seen that are departing seats were $0 each and our returning seats were $13 each. I also paid for a checked bag for departing only $42. And insurance $31. But when I look on my banking app I see I was charged $131 for the bag and seats alone. And charged an additional $31 for insurance. When I called the man told me he sees the same amount and it must be a technical issue but was not able to issue me a refund because seats are non refundable. So I basically paid $600 for a flight on spirit. This is ridiculous, I basically wasted money instead of saving like I thought I would cause spirit is suppose to be cheap. I could of took JetBlue because even  their flight was $500 they allow free carry on bags and free regular seats. I will never ride Spirit again!",-1

My husband and I decided to try Spirit airlines as we are on a budget and wanted to save a little money. Forget saving money, they charge $65 for a carry on if you pay at the gate, they charge for water, and I will never fly this airline again.  I have flown frequently with different airlines and every single airline except Spirit airline has treated me fairly. All the agents we spoke with were rude, hard to understand due to language barriers, grumpy and unhelpful. I spent over two hours haggling with this company because they left us sitting on the tarmac for 46 minutes to be exact and we missed our connecting flight. We were left to find lodging and were never compensated for one mistake they made in delaying us.

2019-07-03,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Montego Bay via Nashville,3.0,,3.0,,,5.0,1.0,worst experience in flying,True,"  Tampa to Montego Bay via Nashville. I hope I never have to fly this airline again. This was my worst experience in flying. Everyone, understand that by the time you pay for everything, you are not saving money! It's not even the fact that everything costs. It was the actual airline's inability to get me from one place to the other in a timely manner or at least explain to me why this was happening. I was traveling from Jamaica back to FL and the flight was four hours late. First were were told a time that the plane would arrive and the time moved back a couple of times until our 3:14pm flight arrived at 7:30pm. Everyone kept saying due to weather, but no one could tell us what or where this ""bad"" weather was. They were so blasé. We were told that we would miss connecting flights and were offered hotel vouchers. I told the staff that I had to try to make my connecting flight. The plane arrived and we were given $7.00 vouchers for food for the night. I didn't read the fine print so I'm not sure where we could eat for $7.00. Finally we made it to Ft. Lauderdale. I made it to the flight which I believe they had held for 30 minutes. On the flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Tampa, we were given $100 vouchers to use within 60 days. An email was supposed to be in my inbox within 24 hours explaining how to use the voucher. I never received an email. There is a number on the voucher to call to receive a code to activate the voucher. I got a recording and was never able to speak with anyone. The recorded information was to book flights. This was the absolute worst experience that I have had with an airline in 30 years of traveling and now I can't even use the voucher. I never want to use this airline again. I do thank God that I made it back home safely.",-1

I was very surprised with how nice the agent at the bag drop counter was in Fort Lauderdale. My last experience at this airport was not so positive. I went for the big front seat which made the journey more pleasant however if the seat could be pre-reclined better it would be great. The flight attendants were actually very nice, as someone who travels with Spirit every two months I have to say they are trying to improve perception and the crew is getting friendlier or at least better trained. Good job Spirit and please bring back the 7:00AM ACY TO FLL flight. I will fly JetBlue out of Philadelphia in a few weeks because you took that flight out of ACY. To be fair to Spirit you get exactly what you pay for, they advertise as a value airline so a lot of the negative reviews are really unfair.",1

For a 6:45 AM flight the crew was surprisingly pleasant. This was one of Spirit’s older aircrafts with the old paint job and it looked a little bit beat up on the inside however the big front seat is always a plus, if you can, go for it. They took me from point A to point B efficiently, and on time. Spirit if you can pre-recline the big front seat a little bit more that would be amazing. I paid exactly for what I wanted and that is what I got. No major complaints here.",1

Over priced baggage for poor service. Flight was delayed multiple times and partly due to waiting on a crew member who was extremely late. Not worth spending less money for the initial ticket for what we actually got. Baggage fees alone ended up being as much as a flight with better accommodations with other airlines.

I had to stand in another line for another hour and the customer service made us to wait for another 30 mins. They said they couldn't do anything at this time, they claim they called for 6.20am passengers. There was too much chaos in the airport for anyone to hear their call. They were ready to book in another flight 2 days later for an additional $99/person. I checked online and there was another connection flight via MYrtle beach for the same day. The agent was rude and refused to put us on that plane saying they see more than what is listed on spirit.com. She said even if I booked online, it would be a waste of money. If the seats are not available, why would they show online. Either spirit.com is lying or the agent is lying. Either way it is outrageous.

Traveling with infant and bags never got checked after being paid for and we had to try and get them through security and having to throw away $200 worth of personal hygiene items purchased for the trip. Told no more flights available and looked on line and see 4 seats available. Just not worth ever flying with them.

I called the customer service I was on hold for more than an hr. Of course, the response was ""I apologize we have NO control, the weather is to blamed"". Mainwhile all other flights today leaving from NYC were all scheduled and no delays so I don't think they are telling the truth. The airplane flight #705 was not even in LaGuardia, it was n Fort Lauderdale ready to fly to Cancun at 10:40a.m. I called spirit again and I spoke to 2 customer rep and finally the manager total 2hrs hold. They offered me to cancel my flight to Cancun & will refund me the money. I was advised by the manager to look for another flight/Airline one way from LaGuardia to Cancun but they will not pay for the difference. He said he exhausted all the options & they will not compensate me for the loss of my resort stay & flight. My new flight is June 25 & 3 days are wasted.  I'm sad & I'm very hurt, disappointed coz i was hoping this would be a good summer vacation experience for my whole family. So, now we are going to wait 3 days before we can fly to Mexico with no compensation offered. So unfair. I was reading some of the reviews and I'm really shocked to find out that so many people had to go through this nightmare. I'm also surprised that Spirit Airlines is still on business.

2019-06-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Cancun,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0, I’ve had enough,False,"  I used to be all about Spirit! I knew it wasn’t the most comfortable or the best airline, but it got me to my destinations for a very low price, and I never had problems! I would always get told all the negatives about Spirit from everyone! But I had Spirits back. I loved it! That was until I came across 3 disappointing experiences. 1. They missed our connecting flight to come back home. They promised us vouchers for food, hotel stay and free ticket on the next airline. I thought that was great. Wrong. They gave us our food and hotel vouchers right then and there, and told us to call a number to receive our free flight. I went through upper management and nothing was done from their end.  I was on my way to Cancun from Dallas. They told us everything was great on time. - wrongN. We missed our connecting flight. & let me tell you, they got us on the next flight to Chicago.  They didn’t want to pay a hotel night nor anything else. This one just did it for me. I travel every 2-3 months with Spirit and they would never add my mileage to my account. I had to manually enter the code. Ok, fine. I entered my last trip (Cancun) to come to find out this week that they never went through in the system AND to top it off, they removed all my mileage points in which I was saving u. And now they can’t return them? Honestly do yourself a favor and don’t rely on Spirit. I’m such a patient person, but I’ve had enough.",-1

This has been the worst experience I have had with an airline. The flight has been delayed 10 hours because Spirit forgot to schedule a pilot. When asking for compensation they gave everyone $7 food vouchers. I will never fly this airline again. Delta and southwest are both much better options. This is gross mismanagement and should not be legal.,-1

",True,"  Buy your ticket in advance and save that way. I was charged $285 for a last minute ticket which was the reasonable option considering every other ticket was 400+ but it just wasn’t worth it. Between the chairs they make you sit in, to the over priced food/drinks on the flight to the  fees they don’t tell you about. I was charged an extra 20 dollars for a “seating assignment fee” which I thought I was avoiding by picking the random seating assignment. The onboard staff were friendly but that’s about all the good I have to say about this airline.",-1

2019-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Horror show,True,"  Indianapolis to Las Vegas. Horror show: worst flight in 60 years of flying. Plane from Las Vegas arrived in time around 7pm for our return in it to Las Vegas, supposedly continuing to my destination that night arriving at 1am the next day. But there was a problem with some landing gear. We waited for repairs until 1 am, when we were told that the plane would not be fixed, and hotels for overnighting were being searched for. At 4:30 am we were told that they had been found, but out in suburbs, and we would have to find and pay for our own transportation to get there. A special flight was being added the next day for us at 1pm. A high stack of thin foam mattress pads was wheeled out for us to sleep on the floor. I chose that option with a bunch of other intrepid souls, not liking the transportation options and the few hours for sleep allowed in the distant hotel offering.... I wondered at the time that a company would happen to have a supply of mattresses on hand like that. The next day, I got on that 1pm flight to Las Vegas, then caught a quick standby flight to Portland--but my luggage did not make it. Spirit's baggage handling was not available by phone, and I had reservations to continue by vacation hundreds of miles away the next day by car. By wandering around in the airport, the next morning, I spotted my small red suitcase behind a glass fronted storage cabinet... by asking a Security Guard, I got some advice about getting help from an Arrivals desk near the vacant Spirit desk, who had a key to it! On my return home, on an overnight flight sitting upright in a chair, which I have never tried to sleep in before, I did not get any sleep.  The cost-cutting non-reclining seats were an inspiration from hell, and the desk-bound decision maker's purchase of bungee straps to hold safety cards and not a pouch to store waterbottles in so they did not roll dangerously about on the floor should be used to replace chairs for these idiots to sit on!",-1

Non-existent customer service, filthy seats, disgusting bathroom with toilet paper and urine on floor. Super tight, no legroom or personal space between customers, sat between two people coughing and hacking and sneezing the whole flight. Crew member was lazy and offered no assistance to anyone. The worst part yet? They ripped me off for my flight home. I accidentally booked a p.m. when I needed an a.m. flight. (There is no way to change your flight after you book it online). When I tried to phone customer service they put you on hold for hours and hours so you can’t try to make changes. In order to get home, it cost me money for an additional flight because their policy was 24 hours. They just kept my money, no credit. When I did finally got hold of someone they disconnected the call when I asked to talk with a supervisor.",-1

My husband and 7 year old daughter are trying to get home from Houston when the flight was delayed twice then eventually cancelled ""due to weather."" I am in Denver 20 minutes from the airport and the weather is fine. The only reason they say this is so they arent obligated to put people in a hotel room. Now they cant get another flight out until Wednesday a day and a half later. To top it off the ""customer service"" people at the counter were rude beyond belief, when the slightest but of frustration was showed by a passenger they threatened to call airport security on them. Such a horrible experience for my 7 year old to witness. Pay the extra 30 bucks for a good airline that cares about their customers.",-1

So my flight was delayed, no big deal, this happens all the time, so let's ignore that part. The truly sad part about my flight is that I'm sure, as far as the airline is concerned, everything went as expected (aside from the delay). This was the worst flying experience in 25 years of flying, by a mile. Don't be fooled by the cheap fares, they charge you for everything and provide nothing. Early Check-in - Pay Me. Pick a seat? - Pay Me (Most airlines will automatically at least seat people together who book their tickets together, not these guys). Check a bag - Pay Me. Bring a carry-on - Pay Me. Any snacks? - Pay Me. Only a matter of time before thye start charging for taking a pee. Worst seats in the world. Don't recline, have no padding, no headrests, no entertainment screen. Zero entertainment options available, not even so much as a SkyMall magazine. They found the bottom of the barrel, kicked it out and just kept digging. Pathetic excuse for an airlines. Never, never, never again Spirit Airlines.",-1

When trying to check in (not realizing I had boarding pass already on phone) tried to scan on machine, which kept reading not checked in yet. I went to an employee for help, she couldn’t bother looking at my phone to tell me know the boarding pass was on my phone (if always printed out boarding passes) told her the machine kept saying we must check in first, she all she kept saying was get in line to check in for flight, Wouldn’t even take the time to listen, that I had already checked in. We were returning from a memorial they had at the Vietnam Veterans site for all veterans that had passed away after arriving home from Vietnam. My husband had just passed away due to agent orange exposure and I was devastated and still confused because of his death. But this employee wouldn’t listen at all as I tried to explain to her I had checked In already, along with my son and young grandson. She just kept saying get in line, where people were checking bags, we had no bags to check in with and by this time it was 5:15 and had to wait in line for over 45 minutes with people that were checking their bags. Running to security, then to gate ( I had hurt my back and have horrible sciatica down my leg) but my son ran a head and got to the gate at 5:55. The attendant told us the doors just closed and we were unable to board plane. So we missed our plane home after a very emotional 2 days, because an employee at the check in wouldn’t take the time to look at my phone and explain I could use that for boarding pass and did not need to wait in line for 45 minutes. I will never use this airline again. Also now reading others experience with this airline ( should have known better when calling with questions before even leaving for this trip. The customer service for this airline is just as bad, no matter what button you press for a question. They also have NO discounts for families of Americans veterans, money is all that matter to this airline. Never again will I ever use this airline, no compassion, no help with questions from their customers. Horrible!!",-1

2019-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Ft Lauderdale via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never fly with this airline,True,"  Cancun to Ft Lauderdale via Denver. Our first flight was delayed out of Cancun, Mexico. The agent told us that we would have 30 minutes to pick up our bags, make it through customs, recheck the bags, get through security, and get to the gate. This was very hard to do with my 71 year old uncle who is a Navy Veteran and was recouping from a prior ankle surgery. Still, we devised a plan. I helped him and my aunt & uncle through the airport while my boyfriend dealt with the bags. My boyfriend and I made it to the gate and on the plane. My aunt and uncle were just behind us since the metal detector went down in their security line, causing another delay. They showed up to the gate just one minute after boarding ended and were not allowed on. My boyfriend and I tried over and over to explain the situation to the flight attendants, but no one cared. It was THEIR OWN flight that was delayed, yet the only response we kept getting was ""Well, they should have made it to the gate on time. I don't care who he is or what he went through, the gates are closed. Now take your seat."" The ""next flight out"" wasn't available until the next morning and it was a 12 hour flight with FOUR layovers, one of which was only 30 minutes long. My aunt had to purchase 2 new one way tickets for $1200 just to get home via United airlines, 24 hours later. Spirit has yet to respond to my complaint or offer the refund they promised for the flight from FLL to Denver. On top of all this, they also turned away two handicap families who were also waiting to board the flight, but were told to wait. Those two families were offered the same 12 hour flight with 4 layovers. One family had a mentally handicapped little girl in a wheel chair and the other family had someone who was on oxygen. Spirit doesn't care how much money you paid, the issues THEY caused, or who you are. They will treat you like you're nothing without hesitation. Never fly with this airline.",-1

We choose our flight when we selected it we ended up with a different return flight. Guess what we have to pay more to change the time and it was 15 mins later and $100 more. Next to get me and my partner seated next to each other $70 each, each way. they wouldn't give us a pair of seats a month in advance to sit next to each other. I suggest pay that initial $200 and you'll enjoy your flight much more with a different airlines. I'll never fly with them again. Reason giving a 2 out of 10 we did land.",-1

Air conditioner was not working on one side of the plane, had to keep windows closed the entire flight. The flight attendants in the front were talking so loud about their personal business for the entire flight! Not attentive at all to other passengers, just laughing and chatting loudly. Other people around were trying to sleep and couldn’t because of their disrespect for the passengers. Never again will I use Spirit Airlines.",-1

In fact, the gate agent told me he didn't want to announce over PA system because he knew people ""would go nuts."" They eventually announced that they were waiting on a crew, flight delayed and within 30 minutes the flight was cancelled. By now, it's 7.30 pm and no available flight that night or the next day to accommodate my schedule. Had to spend the night in New Orleans, eat and Uber without any compensation by Spirit. They refunded the ticket but I had to spend $575 to get home on Southwest. Claiming it was because of weather, the gate agents sheepishly couldn't give any vouchers for anything. I will never fly on Spirit and urge others to do the same. It is a discount airline for a reason. No customer service and very poor handling of a sold out plane. The gate agents basically told everyone what was really happening and then ""corporate"" sent the email saying the flight was cancelled for ""weather"" related reasons. So disappointing.",-1

I came in from Indianapolis. Was supposed to transfer on this plane and take it to San Diego airport tonight. Now all of us have to spend the night in the airport they will not give us any rooms or any food. I am a single girl and this is unacceptable. Spirit Airlines said it was related to bad weather which is absolutely a lie, the weather is absolutely perfect, their plane left early. Unbelievable, we are all outraged.

On the way there I was spilled water from a passenger from behind and lots of it. On the way back was worse I was spilled again from a child in front and two other passengers in the same row left because of it. The child also was hitting me from in front on the head and screaming almost the whole flight and a few more in close vicinity screamed as well. I paid $43 US for my checked luggage to and from and on the way back it was slightly over 40lbs so they charged another $30. The ticket agents were incredibly rude and nasty. My carry on was the exact measurement except the wheels were about an inch so they charged another $65. Even charged for water. My daughter is five and sat there quietly and I have flown with her when she was a baby and worked very hard to keep her quiet. I should have taken photos of the mess from that child in front of us.,-1

Once reading the Baggage requirements, We decided to pay for only two checked bags. My family of 5 (including 3 teenage girls) were able to safely pack everything into two bags without going over the weight limit. Unlike previous comments, the flight crew was very courteous and even engaging during the entire flight. Landed in Atlanta early and our bags were waiting for us when we arrived a baggage claim.

I fly frequently for work so it didn't make me no never mind. The entire flight was GREAT!

The charge online for baggage when you book is supposed to be $26. When I got my credit card, they not only charged $30 for the bag but again charged for my seat which I had already paid the travel agent for. I also had to pay for a drink of water. By the time I paid for all the extra's, I paid more than if I had flown a decent airline. The crew were nasty to anyone who was not in first class. No help at all. The seats were so crowed, a 5'4"" my knees were hitting the seat in front. My husband who is 6' had to sit sideways. No inflight entertainment at all.",-1

Incredibly inefficient process with Spirit Airlines. Bag checkin took an hour and half. Original flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale delayed by one hour. This resulted in personal telling us we would not make connecting flight to Dominican Republic through Spirit airlines. They only had one available seat the next day and could not get our family of four to Dominican Republic until two days later. There was a complete line of people with the same problem. Spirit Airlines attendants were rude, unhelpful and had attitude of disinterest. I cancelled and asked for full refund of ticket price.",-1

The flight was booked with the understanding that it was direct and no layovers. The reason for the rush was because the relative was arriving for a funeral.

I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again. When contacted about some sort of credit they said ""no"" and offered a $42 dollar credit that needs to be used within six months.

I will never fly on Spirit Airlines again. The price was incredible, I honestly couldn’t believe the deal I got on this flight, however, once I flew the first leg I understood why it was so cheap. They literally charge you for everything, including water ($3 for a small bottle) and snacks on the flight. It wasn’t so bad because it’s only a 2 hour flight, so I didn’t get anything. My major complaint is on the ride home. I got to the airport early, and then found out that my flight was delayed 30 minutes, which was no big deal, it’s only 30 minutes. However, it got delayed 2 more times for a total of 4 hours. I walked up to the clerk and asked about rescheduling my flight, and found out it would be 24 hours for the next flight because they only have 1 flight a day that goes to Raleigh. Luckily I have family in the area and I stayed with them overnight. The next day I get to the airport and find out that my flight is delayed again. While I waited for my flight I looked up the track record of Spirit from this particular airport and found that most of their flights are delayed on a daily basis.",-1

So then we were rescheduled to catch a flight the next day. One I received an email literally an hour before it was time for me to get the airport that my flight time had been moved up. So after rushing and getting my kids ready in such haste, we get to the airport to only find out that our flight attendants aren't here. My children and I have spent over 10 hours in the airport waiting for us to get home and I haven't heard anything but excuses. This is the worst flight experience I have ever had I will never ever fly Spirit again.",-1

Our first cancellation was the night of 6/8 due to weather, which I understand, as we had just driven from SC to Atlanta and there were flash flood warnings and heavy rain. Their best response was a flight out two days later on 6/10, which we booked. Arrived at the airport 6 hours early for a 9.49 pm departure as we had to check out of hotel. Flight delays started coming in at 9.34 am saying they were delayed about 40 minutes which was no big deal. Flight delays again at 2.22, 4.23, and then the cancellation at 7.51. Checked the weather map and the flight was going from Ft Lauderdale to Boston to Atlanta. Definitely weather along the route from Ft Lauderdale to Boston but Atlanta was clear. Checked flight path from Boston to Atlanta once the plane left Boston and it was making normal time. Plane arrived in Atlanta with no weather in Atlanta or along the flight path to Denver. Had to go from the boarding gate back to ticketing along with the other customers where they said our option was a flight out on 6/12. That would be a four day delay and even though hotels are not crazy expensive around Atlanta airport we didn't want to spend another two days. We ended up booking Southwest out early on 6/11 for an additional $400. Agents at ticketing gave two options (same as on 6/8). Full refund or re-book for two days later. No compensation for meals or hotels as it was ""weather"" related. Lots of families and young couples on the flight that may not have had the option for spending another $200 per person for a different airline. I understand weather but something was fishy about the whole cancellation as checking the late night departure board had NO cancellations other than Spirit (see attached photo). Will not chose Spirit again.",-1

If that wasn't bad enough he had a return flight at 8.30pm which resulted in a 3 hour delay. He didn't get home until after 3am. All of this in less than a 24hr period. The airline didn't even offer them ""water"". Deplorable!. No compensation either. Will never fly Spirit Airlines again.

We bought backpacks, so no need to pay for luggage, check in was a breeze at both airports, everyone was helpful and friendly. It was my first flight alone. I can not say enough good about this airline. I did my research, and prepared for everything I could think of, just in case. I did buy a couple of snacks and 2 glasses of wine in a package while on flight. It was $20 I believe. Same as it would have been in a restaurant. So I’m not sure what the negative reviews are about. I had a wonderful experiences both ways! When I can afford too , I will definitely fly with Spirit Airlines again. !",1

The delay was understandable, due to weather in Florida. The plane was full and after 30 minutes it was very hot. We asked if we could have some water and were told they could not serve any beverages until they were in flight. I suppose there is a reason for this, and that's not my complaint. When we were finally in the air and very thirsty, the drink cart came by. You need to pay for water. With a credit card, which was in the bag, under the seat and very difficult to get to. After any delay, it would seem only right to offer water as soon as possible. I hope I never book another flight on Spirit Airlines.",-1

My wife and I had a flight (505 on June 9th) set to leave Austin for a red eye to get into Portland June 9th. The flight was delayed for an hour and a half which means we would miss our connecting flight. So we're sitting in the airport wondering what the next step is. The representative while it appears she may be trying to be helpful does not have any other flights available for about 24 hours. What's the company's response? There's nothing they can do ""I'm sorry you're going to have to get a new flight and we will not put you up in hotel because the delay was minor."" All this sounds pretty normal until you hear the reason for the delay. Lack of crew. That's the official reasoning. My mind can only wonder what lack of crew means when an airline officially tells you that's the reason for an hour and a half delay on their flight. Here we are, three small kids at home after a business trip, no hotel, no flight for 24 hours, and I had to be on the phone for over an hour to get my money back. Don't get ""Spirited away"", stay away! This company does not value people or families or customer service.. or at least that is my official impression.",-1

2019-06-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Las Vegas via New Orleans,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,delay has caused major problems,False,"  My flight from Oakland to New Orleans was delayed by 3 hours, which caused me to have to pay a $500 rebooking fee through my missed connecting flight the next morning. This is the second weekend in a row that Spirit's multi-hour delay has caused major problems for my flights. Spirit refused to offer any compensation for this and didn't offer any solutions. Customer service was unhelpful and employees at the airport were (literally) non-existent. I used to use Spirit exclusively due to their slightly cheaper flights, but the headaches and major financial burden they have been the cause of lately are no longer worth it.",-1
2019-06-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,Needless to say never again,False,"  65$ for the Carry-On. Needless to say never again. I've not boarded yet, but the standard they're setting against other airlines makes me think that the company is overall greedy. It's not the crew's fault, but the company itself should be ashamed of itself. I can understand check-in and that was why I'd decided to pack light. But to be slapped with this charge for round trip!? It's absurd quite frankly.",-1
2019-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Greensboro to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,beyond disgusted with this airline,False,"  I'm beyond disgusted with this airline right now as are 95% of the customers on my flight today. I flew on flight 490 from Orlando to Greensboro. I recieved an email last night that our flight would be on time flying out at 11:40 this morning. Myself, my boyfriend and our two kids ages 2.5 years old and 6.5 years old woke up early and checked out of our resort. We arrived at the airport and stood in the 45-60min wait to check our bag which was ridiculous. The proceeded to the security line only to see our flight was cancelled. Went through security and to the gate our flight was supposed to leave from. Ask what was going on and was told our flight was cancelled due to weather. It was clear in Orlando, so I called my mother ro ask her about weather in Greensboro, she stated it was clear. Again I have 2 small kids and am being told our flight is cancelled basically for no reason. Then about 30-60 mins later we hear it's been delayed and will be boarding at 12:30, leaving out of gate 31 now. So we proceed to gate 31 and wait.  We were told not to got too far because the crew would be boarding soon a d then we would be able to board. We boarded at 12:55. We were then told the baggage count was off so they would recount and then we'd be on our way. They recounted and the count was right after 20mins. Then we were told we now had to wait for another crew member who was on an incoming flight. We found this odd seeing as we didn't have to do that before but now we needed another crew member? Who was on an incoming flight? Seriously? Again I have 2 small children. So we waited and waited and waited some more. We were not offered any drinks or food during our 2 hour wait on the plane. No one came around to check on us.  My kids were starving and thirsty. My youngest child needed a diaper change, but there was no where to change him. No one cared about any of us. This was their first flight experience and this was horrible.  We were told the crew member had finally arrived but then they couldnt locate them so we waited even more. Then were told again the had landed again and were on their way. We finally left at 3:10. We were asked different we wanted to purchase anything, over 90% of the plane declined as we were all disgusted no one offered us anything, gave us no updates, didnt check on kids, didnt check on the elderly, or if anyone needed medications or anything. We arrived around 4:40 I wrote my review for Spirit and only got offered $50 airline vultures to be used by this month, June.",-1

I booked a one way ticket departing on Wednesday (tomorrow) and arriving at 10:53am. When I went to check in for my flight I noticed the confirmation was for yesterday. There was a booking error, When I called spirit to tell them the booking date was wrong and if I can switch to the day I needed they said there are no flights that day. When I looked on line there were 4 seats available at the same time I was supposed to be scheduled, but for a lot more money. I just now got a confirmation email from Spirit regarding the get ready to travel, options to pick a seat and baggage info, for my upcoming flight, however it’s dated for yesterday, when it was supposed to be for tomorrow!",-1

On May 25, 2019 flight 1669 from Columbus Oh to Orlando Fl because of the crew. I really thought they must be comedians. I realize Spirit doesn’t have the greatest ratings but this was a memorable, fun filled 2.5 hour flight because of the attendants! Great job guys!",1
2019-06-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Austin,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,do not fly with Spirit Airlines,False,"  Spirit staff was the rudest in customer service that I have ever experienced. They make you feel like you are absolutely stranded with no remorse or apologies. We travel a lot and get that things happen, but when you feel like you have to fight to get home and pay extra money for a hotel room, rides to and from the airport, food, and toiletries that were lost by Spirit it is a horrible feeling.  Pay the extra with other airlines because you will end up paying the exact same with what they charge for seats, carry-ons, checked bags, and food/drinks. They cancelled our flight due to weather when all other flights were on time from our location to our destination around the same time. They gave us minimal options to get home. A refund of $170, to fly home 24 hours later with 2 layovers, or to fly home 2 days later. The staff in Austin Airport for Spirit airlines was completely understaffed and not trained properly to handle the situation of a cancelled flight with the website and app not working. The manager was completely overwhelmed and frantic. He was dealing with the pilots and the unhappy travelers that their flights were just cancelled with no other options. They showed no remorse. Valerie in Spirit airlines Austin tried her best, but when we triple checked with her if our bags were going from Austin to our layover destination she stated yes. All of our luggage did not make it to our layover destination for 24 hours and they could not tell us where our luggage was or if it would end up at our final destination. Each person we encountered we felt like we had to fight or argue for answers. Not one staff member was helpful or apologetic for the huge hassle of travel and stress they had caused. The 3 of us girls were traveling together and they could not put us on the same flight home. We were forced to split up. They authorized one of us to fly home 2 days later when we never agreed to that. We wanted the chance to be put on standby to have a chance at getting on the same flight. We called on our baggage the next day, which somehow got split up. At first the lady answers the phone and says I can’t help you, you will get an update in 24-48 hours. She did not even try or ask for our claim number. Once we were harsh and made her look at our claim number she saw our bags arriving in LAX at 2pm and 9:40pm. Once we finally made it to LAX my luggage had arrived. We went to baggage claim to pick up my friends where the staff stated they did not know where our luggage was and it may be on a delayed flight. Many other angry guests were in baggage claim as well. I walked out and stood next to random Spirit carousel (not our flight), where I saw my friends bag going around. I could go on into more details about how horrible of an experience we had and how we never thought it could get worse and it just kept getting worse. Please do not fly with Spirit Airlines.",-1
2019-06-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to New York,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,disaster of customer service,True,"  Chicago to New York. An absolute disaster of customer service: the flight cancelled due to allegedly weather conditions. A rude representative announces the next available flight is 48 hours down the road. Graciously offers a refund of 80 dollars when the price of a new ticket is over 300 (leaving alone lost wages, hotel expenses, etc) with zero willingness to accommodate in any shape or form, even though I was willing to fly anywhere within a 300 miles radius just to get back to work. Definitely the last time I or any of my family or friends flying Spirit.",-1
2019-06-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Raleigh,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,had to pay for our carry on bag,False,"  I will not be taking Spirit Airlines again. First, disappointed that me and my husband had to pay for our carry on bag (which totaled to 80 for two bags). Secondly, our flight was late because a flight attendant was late. It is one thing if the plane is late due to weather or whatever, but it is ridiculous that our flight was late because the flight attendant was late.",-1
2019-06-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,not the big front seat I paid for,True,"  The seating map on the website is wrong. I paid $32 for a big front seat to arrive on the plane and realize that the third row of that plane was a normal seat which is $19 and not the big front seat which I paid for. I sent emails with screen shots of the wrong seat map demanding a partial refund because I did not get what I paid for and the flight attendants could not assist. I was basically told regardless of Spirit providing the wrong seating map I choose the seat so they will not refund me. In addition to this I forgot a book in the seat pocket and for three days I could reach no one at baggage claim at Jax or FLL to confirm if they found the item. This service is horrible and people need to know paying less will not be worth it with this airline unless you are ok with being robbed, sitting in uncomfortable seats or not getting what you paid for based on the misleading information the website provides. I also tried calling to cancel my return trip and was on hold in excess of 15 minutes with a recording telling me I should go online.",-1
2019-06-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Oakland,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst experience,True,"  Boston to Oakland. Absolutely the worst experience. They have slightly lower prices than other airlines, but after add-on fees, actually cost more. I purchased 3 tickets from Boston to Oakland. I wound up paying over $300 for luggage (2 checked bags and 1 carry on). Seats were horribly uncomfortable, with no room at all. They charged for anything to drink, even water. The flight home was the worst I have experienced, it was a ""red eye"". There wasn't even enough room to even sit comfortably, let alone try to sleep. Seats were molded plastic, upright, unable to recline, with absolutely no room at all. It was the worst flying experience I have ever had. It costs more in long run for a horrific, uncomfortable, long flight. I never have written a review, but felt compelled to do so about my unfortunate experience.",-1
2019-05-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,was treated horrible,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Newark. I arrived to the airport 2 hours before the flight. I was checked in a day before and when I came to the gate, I was told that I am on the wrong flight even though I had my boarding pass. They told me that they have no time to talk to me and I should go to customer service. The line in customer service was like 20 people and a lady who worked there was super rude and just yelled at me that she “I can’t deal with her”. She was rude and unprofessional. When I run back to the gate, there were about 20 people with the same issue, all were told that they are not in the system. After the lady yelled at me that I am in the wrong flight and not even looking at my boarding pass, I had to wait an hour. 5 minutes before departure I finally got a new boarding pass and when I came in to the flight someone was sitting on my seat and they also had the boarding pass with the same seat. I do not understand how business can function with such a horrible customer service, with super rude people. It is unacceptable to have this issue. Everyone was treated horrible on the flight. There were rude women in customer service and other 2 ladies had no idea what was going on. Also, there was a gum on my seat and my jeans were completely destroyed. I requested the refund for the damaged item and they told me to submit a receipt. It what I did. Lady replied, that she received everything and check will be mailed to me. A month later, they said that I have to submit a different claim, and they have never received anything even after I showed them that my email clearly states that a lady received my receipt.",-1
2019-05-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Santo Domingo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,first and last flying with Spirit,True,  Tampa to Santo Domingo. This was my first and last flying with Spirit. The plane was small and outdated. The seats are uncomfortable. They don’t offer you not even a cup of water. You have to pay for all bags including carry on. If you don’t buy your luggage at the time you purchase the ticket you pay almost double the fee. If you have even 1Lb over in you very highly charged luggage you have to pay $100. I travelled with my toddler who has a stroller and they do not accommodate you at all. When you land you have to get the stroller at the baggage claim instead of right outside the aircraft.,-1

Thought I was getting a great deal flying Spirit only to find out it was the worst flight. Traveled from Kansas City to Minneapolis & Spirit charged me double for my 1 checked bag ($80) because I had a layover in Detroit. To my surprise the flight home costed me another bag fee due to the fact my bag stopped and had to switch planes in Detroit. No water on the plane without paying $3, no phone charge outlets or headphone connection. The seats didn’t even adjust back and the fold down tray table was as big as an iPad Nano.  Never again will I fly Spirit no matter how much cheaper it “appears” online.",-1
2019-05-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,purchase seats and pay for carry on,True,  Dallas Ft Worth to Baltimore. Flight hasn't left yet - the customer service department has limited knowledge of the English Language. Their technology doesn't work which created the need to call in to purchase seats and pay for a carry on. After paying for both I asked if the payment covered both directions of the round trip flight. The supervisor I spoke with couldn't tell that I had a round trip and was only charging me for seats and bags one way. After struggling with her to find my other flight she again took my CC info for payment of the seats and carry on for the return. I understand this scheme - frustrate the passenger with the language barrier to end the call quickly and frustrated so upon the return flight charge the passenger more at the gate because the system that Spirit has doesn't connect the passengers together. Good job Spirit - excellent way to increase your margins in the pocket books of the passengers and paying wages for a call center outside of the U.S. Never again,-1
2019-05-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,zero help from any staff,True,"  Indianapolis to Las Vegas. This airline is So bad we bailed on our flight after 4 consecutive delay “texts” with no explanation. They didn’t even update the airport boards or gate. Finally they claimed a mechanical problem with the a/c caused the 3.5 hour delay. The employees are totally incompetent and don’t care. We finally said no more and opted to go home and they promised to pull our baggage off the plane and sent us down to baggage claim where one was pulled off after 2 hours and the other ended up in Vegas. We are still trying to get it back with zero help from any staff. They literally leave the airport after working their late night flights leaving you stranded if you have a problem. As I’m writing this, no one has responded to numerous calls about our issues and after filing out a claim form and numerous attempts to speak to an employee who cares. This airline charges $45 per bag fees each way then they lose your bags and couldn’t care less. Unexplained delays, incompetent employees and you’ll experience a nightmare - steer clear of this joke of an airline.",-1

2019-05-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience ever,True,"  I took a flight from Fort Lauderdale, FL with a layover in Atlanta, GA. We were scheduled to arrive in Atlanta at 12am and fly out to Boston at 6 am. They canceled the morning flight 1 hour before it was due to take off and blamed it on “weather” conditions. There were no weather issues in Atlanta or in Boston that morning, I have no idea where that came from. Then it took us 45 min to get on the phone with someone to see what our options were. They offered us another flight at 10pm to arrive in Maryland for a layover at 12am and to get to Boston at 7:47am. (No thank you), second option was a partial refund which was less than half of the money we spent btw, and the reasoning was because we still boarded from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Atlanta, GA. Even though that was only a layover. Our Third option was “Spirit Credit”. We were stuck in that airport over 12 hours until we finally decided to buy another one way ticket to Boston with JetBlue Airlines. So we spent way more in the end! Spirit This was the worst experience ever. I will never fly with them again. Don’t waste your time.",-1
2019-05-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Myrtle Beach,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,they continue to not care,True,"  New York to Myrtle Beach. This airline's business model is focused on scamming customers in as many ways as they can. They pull you in with low base fares, and then intentionally make every single step of the experience unpleasant. They claim it's part of cutting costs, but since when did being professional, courteous, and caring to a minimal standard compromise bottom line profits. If their staff acted professionally, and they didn't try to jam fees and credit card scams down your throat at every single point of the experience then perhaps they could be considered a respectable low-cost carrier like RyanAir or Southwest, but no. Spirit is the airline that wants you to have a bad experience in hope's that they'll push you to pay extra for some crappy add-ons to create a tiny illusion that it isn't actually that bad, but it always is with them so long as they continue to not care about their customer experience.",-1

They don't care and it really doesn't matter how much you complain you don't get any satisfaction except for a hotel room for 4 people until your next flight out and on a different airline because evidently that can't ""finish"" what they started. Do not use them!! Do not use a booking site that uses them no matter how much you think you're saving!! It will cost you more in the end!!",-1
2019-05-24,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Kansas City,1.0,,4.0,,,4.0,3.0,I would fly them again,True,"  . I fly from MYR to MCI 4 or 5 times a year for family reasons. I have resigned myself to a one-stop connection thru CLT with an overall 5-6 hour travel time. So you can imagine how surprised I was to find a nonstop flight listed on Expedia. But it's on Spirit Airlines and everything I hear about them is not so good. So this is my candid review. I expected counter personnel and flight attendants to be rude and unhelpful. This was not the case. The FA's clearly demonstrated on both flights they can TCB and still be pleasant. When I first arrived at the gate in MYB the sign indicated the flight would be delayed 2 hours. I thought it might be an indication the bad stuff I heard about Spirit was starting already. However the gate attendant gave us an update every ten minutes about the departure status and the 2 hour delay turned out to be only 55 minutes. Once aboard, the first thing I noticed was the seats. They quickly remind you that you're flying an LCC. They are cheaply made rack type seats with very little padding, no headrest, and they do not recline. Very uncomfortable for 2.5 hours. Everything on board is at a price, including water. Again, the LCC thing. The aircraft seemed to be fairly new and the interior all appeared in good shape. However, it was clear the floor had not been vacuumed in quite some time. For the most part the flight was pleasant. The thing that bothers me most was the price to check a bag. My bag weighed 23.5 pounds according to their scale and I was charged $50 to check it. I thought this was exorbitant. If I had chosen to carry the bag on I would have been charged as well. The LCC thing again. So, in summary, their people were great, their seats were very uncomfortable, and their baggage fees are overpriced. Would I fly them again? Yes. I am willing to put up with a few disappointments in order to get a nonstop flight. A 2.5 hour trip instead of 5 hours is worth a certain amount of trade off.",1

Nothing on board complimentary, even had to pay for coffee and water. Most uncomfortable, non-adjustable seat I have ever sat in for three and a half hours. The only friendly and polite conversation was the Captians announcements. First time I ever had to pay for carry on. First time checked baggage had a 40lb limit instead of 50.

They canceled my flight from Atlantic City back to Florida because they said they had crew issues they could have delayed it instead they just cancel it which inconvenienced everybody and everybody was steaming mad at 6:30 in the morning. Then you have to rush to try to get a Rent-A-Car which most of them were sold out. All spirit airlines can say is sorry we will give you a $50 voucher and they want you to use it towards their flight within 30 days. I had to purchase for price airfare from United airline and drive with a Rent-A-Car to Newark so I’m out $600 more plus rent a car $80 plus toll fees plus parking at Tampa international airport $20 extra day - and they had the audacity to tell me they can give me a $50 voucher.,-1

When I arrived in fort Lauderdale I had almost 3 hours to claim my bag and make it to the departing gate. Everybody on our flight that was catching a connecting flight missed their next flight because our bags took over 3 hours to reach baggage claim. Spirit ticketing tells me the next available flight is 2 days later at 8:35 pm. I explained to them that I dont have money for a hotel and I am traveling with my wife, 5 yr old son and my 11 yr old daughter which has special needs. They told me that it is not their problem and I was welcome to sleep in the airport until my flight. I called customer service. They told me they cannot comp a room over the phone.

I spent 2 hours and 17 minutes only to be told No. we followed all the steps and was told No because they couldn’t process it. Not an ethical company! You can speak to 3 different people and they will all tell you something different. DO not use this unethical airline. I’m so frustrated.,-1

People should fully research airline policy when flying for the first time. If you had you could have avoided 90% of your frustration. This is a no frills airline. I personally think the business model will be successful and works well if the customer knows what to expect. I have flown twice within the last six months and was a little suspect because of the low fares, but was pleasantly surprised. customer service was good, very smooth flight etc. Seats a little close together, but adequate. If you need free snacks, pillows, blankets, wi-fi you may need to travel with another airline. But if you need to watch your pennies like I do and don't mind a no frills bus ride in the sky this could be for you. We are planning another trip soon and will check Spirit first.",1
2019-05-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Detroit,,,,,,,1.0,$145 cancellation fee,True,"  Denver to Detroit. My flight was scheduled for almost 3 months from today (selecting that date wasnt an option). I called to cancel today. My flight was only $186 and they wanted to charge me a $145 cancellation fee. So, I asked how much to just change that date, she said $170 to change my date. I said that was ridiculous as it's almost double what I paid. She tells me that even if I cancel, I dont get any money back. The 40 something left would be applied as a credit. I explained to her that I was hanging up now, cancel my reservation and if their company needed money that bad they can just keep it.",-1
2019-05-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Baltimore,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,4.0,4.0,Worst customer service,True,"  Las Vegas to Baltimore. Worst customer service I’ve ever had! This is the third time out of six redeye flights from Las Vegas to Baltimore that the crew acts like I’m a hindrance if I don’t want to fall asleep right when the plane takes off. When I asked for a cup of coffee or an alcoholic drink they act like I’m not allowed and I should be sleeping because of the rest of the plan. My service on a redeye should not be any different from my service on any other time during the day, especially when I have to show up and go straight to work. Some veterans at spirit understand and have good energy, but one woman in particular I have seen numerous times on my flights as a blonde who is now pregnant and gives attitude every single time. This is very poor advertising for your company and we shouldn’t allow people with bad attitudes to handle customers in the hospitality Environment",-1
2019-05-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,the worst flight ever,True,  Columbus to Las Vegas. This was the worst flight ever. Price for and over stuffed plane. This is the worst. They broke the tow bar and might have damaged the plane so we are not taking off in time and they never offered anything to drink for the inconvenience. I wish this flight would have been better there is no type of entertainment and you get a stuffed airplane and you hear every one having conversation this will not happen to me again. I will not fly this airplane again,-1
2019-05-17,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Denver,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,prices are incredible,True,"  Spirit Airlines prices are incredible. I'm usually able to put my bag under the seat at no charge. When I do need a larger bag, I check it since that's the cheapest. Here's the negative I've read :  Pay for baggage - yes but you have to pay for bags on every airline except southwest. 2. Pay for drinks - yes but drinks cost the same if you buy it in the terminal. Pay $10 to print boarding pass at gate - I've never had to have my boarding pass printed at the gate or at check in. Leg room I  don't find  much different from other airlines.  I recently read that spirit is adding wifi. Because of the cheap fare, I can survive without wifi. The seats don't recline but neither do they on other airlines - I wouldn't call my seat going back an inch reclining When I know I'm going to be flying, I just keep watching the fares. As a $9 Club Member, I've flown four times in the last six months for less than $50 round trip! Even if I purchased a bag and seats towards the front, my total would be around $150 which is still cheaper than most airlines.",1

This was my first, and probably only flight, I've ever taken with Spirit. Everything started off well, on time flight, easy check in, things going great. The workers for Spirit were kind and welcoming. Boarded the plane, and I had the window seat. 2 people were in the others, so i asked them to move so I could get to it quickly - nothing out of the ordinary. There was a woman in the aisle and a man in the middle. The woman stood up and instead of the man standing or scooting, he sat on his seat which caused me to bump past him. Weird, but oh well. Throughout the next 2.5 hours, the couple took off their shoes - the woman her socks off as well. They were bumping into me while they rubbed each other's arms and legs. The woman was shaking the seats so much that I was being bounced around. She would bang her head on the person in front of her's seat and her hands on the tray table. Just very rude. They didn't wear seatbelts and the whole ordeal made me feel so uncomfortable. Especially when the woman put her feet ON the man's tray table and had him give her a massage. Keep in mind they were probably late 30's, early 40's, and I am in my early 20's. Overall, the experience was terrible and so uncomfortable. I couldn't wait to get off.",-1

This is my first time ever flying and the experience what I thought would be exciting turned out to be a nightmare! Problem after problem I would never recommend this airline to anyone. If you don't plan on spending extra money that wasn't in your plans this is not the airline to go with if you want notification of any changes to your flight this is not the airline this is not the airline to go with.  Money and inconvenience is what this airline is about. To sum it all up spirit airlines is a mess and I will never fly with them again.,-1

On the way to Vegas an extra trip was add without notification. Then the flight before the extra stop, our flight crew was 45 minutes late. Then on the way back they changed part of our party flight. To a direct flight and would not let us change ours. We left Vegas at 1140pm and got back home at 142pm the next day. The rest of our party got home 736am that morning. We hot home 6 hrs later. The whole trip my wife and I had seats side by side and our last and final flight we had to have different seats because they booked the plane and told her the plane was full and she had to take an exit seat or she couldn't fly....wow. I will never fly nor recommend anyone to fly spirit airlines.",-1

First time flying with Spirit and this flight was been delayed over 4 times. 1:04 PM was the original time, then 1:46, then 2:15, then 2:46 now 3:30. I'm shocked as to how horrible this experience has been - we are not boarding until 4:20PM. I'm disappointed in this airline. I feel like everyone here needs to get some time of refund.

Our flight out from Cancun was delayed x2 then cancelled. Next day flight rerouted to Fort Lauderdale arrived at 7:06 pm and after going through customs and retrieving luggage (luggage was placed on wrong carousel and only circled intermittently, unable to access visible cases because we weren’t allowed to) - this delayed us even further. Ran to baggage drop and arrived there at 8:20 pm. Spirit employees would not accept our luggage for 8:45 pm flight, stated we were too late, instructed to go “upstairs and rebook for next day”. No attempt made to find accommodations, given a list of hotels we could stay at - all sold out. We are still en route to Detroit 38 hours later, 3 more hours until 4 am check in, spending night sitting in airport. Never again with Spirit. Customer service was horrible, manager yelling and belittling her own employee who tried to help, ended up dragging her away forcefully by her arm.",-1
2019-05-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Oakland to Los Angeles,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,All in all I lost about $600,True," This was first time that I have ever flown with Spirit airlines. Firstly, my first flight from Oakland to Los Angeles got delayed, but I wasn’t worried. However, after a while I saw that my flight got cancelled, so I called up Spirit, the guy who I spoke to was rude and uninterested. Luckily Spirit rescheduled me on to the next flight but I already lost about $200 for the hotel that I’ve already pre paid. My return flight back home from Los Angeles to Oakland was also cancelled the next day. This really annoyed me because I spent about over 24 hours without and sleep and I wanted to just get home. Spirit then refused me a flight the next morning and also refused to pay for a hotel for me to stay at for the night. Both of these cancelled flights happened to me in a span of 1 day. So in the end I had to pay another $200 for a hotel room for that night plus I had to pay another $180 for a flight home the next morning. All in all I lost about $600. Never ever gonna fly this airline again. I don’t recommend anyone ever flies Spirit Airlines, the round trip ticket wasn’t even that cheap.",-1
2019-05-10,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Tampa,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,airline is the absolute worst,False,"  This airline is the absolute worst! My ticket was $89 from Las Vegas to Tampa with Spirit Airlines. I then had to pay $41 for 1 checked piece of luggage and a minimum of $17 to choose a seat. Seriously? This more than doubles my original understood cost. I will never ever fly them again. I would rather have a layover than pay their ridiculous fees. What seems like an inexpensive flight is going to end up costing the same as a regular airline. Do not, under any circumstances, choose this airline. Well, unless you have no luggage and are fine to sit in a rubbish seat. The only reason I did not choose a zero for my overall rating is I believe the people I interacted with do care.",-1

The aircraft was dirty, the flight attendants were not friendly whatsoever. They never announced welcome aboard flight 1968 with nonstop service to Cleveland, Ohio. They never announced the beverage cart was coming. They spent the majority of the time at the front of the plane talking and laughing with each other. I understand you get what you pay for - but this crew was rude. The captain didn’t even welcome us aboard and announce himself. Had a way better experience flying Frontier. At least they were friendly. Our flight 1969 from Cleveland to Vegas was better than our return flight 1068.",-1
2019-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,charge for literally everything,False,"  There's not much to add to the previous reviews of this airlines. Simply put, one should only fly Spirit airline if they have no other choices. The prices are deceptively low, as Spirit will charge for literally everything. The seats are the least comfortable seats on any American-based carrier. I would describe the seats as ""prison seats."" Customer service is a mixed bag. It my impression that the hard-working employees very much wish to do right by their customers. That said, Spirit's culture is one of ""nickel-and-diming"" the customer to make up for the low fares that entice folks to book in the first place. Spirit will always choose charging the customer rather than doing what is right.",-1

2019-05-08,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Austin,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,My flight was good,False,  New Orleans to Austin. I'm not sure why Spirit have so many bad reviews. My flight was good. It was on time and the landing was smooth. The only thing is their baggage price. The weight limit is 40lbs instead of 50 like most others. The landing was the smoothest landing I've had. They even gave away 5000 flyer's miles to one guest that happens to be sitting in a middle seat because they know that the middle seats can be uncomfortable.,1

Not quite sure how to get check in. When asked for help was ignored. Stood in line behind several passengers. They got checked in. When it was our turn to be checked in, staff said this is not a line and rudely closed the rope so we had to go back into another line after waiting in that line for 15 minutes. We did not get to sit together. How do you not sit families together? This was the most aggravating and stressful. The attendant at the counter told us our flight had been moved up in time that we had to hurry and get to the terminal. We arrived at the terminal, the flight was on time. We were very stressed. The flight left 30 minutes late. Staff on the plane not very kind or friendly. The seats are too small. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again, terrible experience. I will also tell all the friends and family I have not to fly with this airlines.",-1
2019-05-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst airline and customer service,False,"  Worst airline and customer service center ever.  After checking in on line I checked the ""get notifications"" button on the site. We were not notified of the three hour delay, only learning about it when we arrived at Logan airport. Our 3 hr delay turned into a 5 hr delay. We also had the pleasure of waiting in a gate area with angry passengers that had been waiting over 24 hrs for their flight. We were double charged for our bag both ways and said bag arrived so filthy I didn't recognize it at first. By the time our flight arrived after 5:30am the rental car counter was closed. We had to wake a local friend that lives an hour away to rescue us. This left us stranded at our hotel for an entire day while we attempted to straighten things out. I called their customer service center and was promised a refund for our flight and bag charge. Never happened. When I called their customer service center back they had no record of my prior call and the promises made. I would have given them zero on everything but the crew if I could have.",-1
2019-05-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Puerto Rico to Denver via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I am absolutely disgusted2,True,"  I am absolutely disgusted. Mostly with the staff. We were flying in from Puerto Rico to Fort Lauderdale to Denver. The captain told us he took us on a 20 minute detour because of weather leaving us with exactly 10 minutes to get off the plane and to the next gate. There was no weather that caused this delay. Clear skies. Upon arriving at our gate after sprinting there, we asked if our bags would make it over to the next flight, to which the ladies at the desk replied ""theres no way to know until we reach Denver."" We were not the only people who were put off by this answer. We asked again why they would not be able to know or if they could ask someone if any bags from that flight made it over. They said ""no. We are boarding in 3 minutes and not delaying a flight for 'your' bags."" in an awfully condescending tone to say the least. After getting on the plane I was mocked by the two flight attendants,  because I was trying to get to my seat & out of breath. I then turned around and glared at them to which they ignored & continued to mock me.  I promise to never recommend or use Spirit. It's worth the extra buck for your assurance & honestly for your peace of mind. I know I don't like the feeling while waiting here once again on awful service.",-1

Our flight was 14 hours delayed, due to a storm at our destination. Not the airlines fault, but apparently no other airline had problems heading there. Also the airline didn't provide any snacks then when we flew it was just a very poor Service, the Crew at the airport wasn't really concerned about what happened to the people in those hours, they let them just sit around for 14 hours without wifi and didn't even store luggage for free. A guy next to us was informed wrong that he gets a full refund by airline staff and booked a new flight. After booking the same employee said that he won't get any refund and this passenger ended up with two flights then. Once again, the airline was not concerned about that pretty much. All in all, the experience was way below average, there were a few more little things that keep us busy and mad and it was a unsatisfied 18 hour stay at the airport. Wouldn't recommend flying with this Airline, but tickets are cheap though",-1

Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale via Minneapolis. This is my third time flying with Spirit Airlines and it is my last. They sold me a credit card a year ago promising 35,000 miles. They did not deliver on that. I paid for a round trip bag $90 they nickeled and dimed me for $85 more. The staff were rude and not helpful at all. We were delayed on our flight home 2 hours. No communication on the gate change or why it was delayed. The pilot was in such a hurry he swerved and swayed everyone in there seats on the runway. I did not feel safe. Spirit Airlines has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I would recommend you stay away from this airline. They are a rinky dink operation that only cares about nickeling and diming you for more money.",-1

Baltimore to Jacksonville. Ironically the one thing I was trying to avoid happened. I drove 3 hours and passed 2 other airports because I thought I wanted a fast and simple flight. Caught by surprise that wasn’t the case at all. A two hour flight turned into an almost 6 hour delay. I think the worst part is the communication is awful. No one had the decency to keep any passenger alert about what was going on other then the 6 emails that were sent out. I think what really did it was I suggested I just get a refund and go catch another flight because of the importance of which I am flying there. Surprisingly I was told “no you don’t have to do that we will be leaving at 8.02” now it is 9.20 and I’m still here. Sometimes cheaper isn’t always best. I fly often and thought I would become friends with Spirit Airlines because of the prices but maybe I should have read the reviews worst airline you ever have to deal with. After reading the reviews you would think that they would put more effort in as a whole(company) but apparently 1 star ratings make them happy and proud. The crew were probably the most helpful but even that wasn’t enough because they knew just as much as me.",-1

Worst airline to ever exist! Originally bought one way non stop ticket. Spirit changed it to one stop (no discount). On way to one stop in Houston plane got diverted due to weather at Houston so went to New Orleans to refuel but while refueling my connecting flight I was supposed to get on in Houston was some how able to take off in this bad weather. Missed connecting flight, Spirit got me on flight to Los Angeles, not my original destination, but not until the next morning. Customer service said I would get a 50$ voucher but never got one. They also said I would absolutely get on a plane on the 2nd to San Diego but then that plane was too full for the six of us that were stranded due to Spirit's screw up. They lie, they change your itinerary without options or discount, they do not even attempt to correct the screw up beyond covering a sub par motel room and a little food money. Never ever using Spirit again!",-1

They took phone and mail data, but never called to give information about when the next one would come out. There are no phones to call, do not answer the ""help"" or the ""info"" or the ""contact us"" form. For another traveler with whom we became friends I learned that I would leave the next day. I had a connection in FLL, and in GYE they told me not to worry, that in FLL they would solve it because the central office was there. Finally it came out with 25 hours of delay. Surprisingly uncomfortable seats. Absolutely disgruntled flight attendants. Finally in FLL, to solve the connection, I was sent from agent to agent, every time I had to repeat the problem, each less informed and more angry than the previous one, they treated me like a fool for having lost the connection. Finally, after more than two hours of queuing, an incredibly aggressive agent told me they could not do anything, and called the next passenger in the queue. I had to buy a new ticket for my lost connection. In short: I lost my business meetings, I did not do the shopping I was expecting, I lost the hotel reservation and the car rental, I arrived exhausted, mistreated, and cheated, and it cost me more. Low-cost airline? I guess if you're lucky. ES: Mi vuelo Guayaquil to Fort Lauderdale del incómodo horario de 11:59 se canceló. Me tomaron datos de teléfono y correo, pero jamas llamaron a dar información de cuándo saldría el siguiente. No hay teléfonos a los cuales llamar, no responden el “help” ni el “info” ni el formulario de “contáctenos”. Por otro viajero con el que nos hicimos amigos me enteré que saldría al día siguiente. Yo tenía conexión en FLL, y en GYE me dijeron que no me preocupara, que en FLL lo solucionarían porque allí estaba la central. Finalmente salió con 25 HORAS DE RETRASO. Asientos asombrosamente incómodos. Azafatas completamente displicentes. Finalmente en FLL, para solucionar lo de la conexión, me enviaban de agente en agente, cada vez tuve que repetir el problema, cada uno menos informado y más enojado que el anterior, me trataban como a un estúpido por haber perdido la conexión. Finalmente, luego de más de dos horas de hacer colas, una agente increíblemente agresiva me dijo que no podían hacer nada, y llamó al siguiente pasajero en la cola. Tuve que comprar un nuevo ticket para mi conexión perdida. En resumen: perdí mis reuniones de negocio, no hice las compras que esperaba, perdí la reserva del hotel y del alquiler del auto, llegué agotado, maltratado, y engañado, y me costó más. Aerolínea de bajo costo? Supongo que si tienes suerte...",-1
2019-04-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst experience ever,True,  Las Vegas to Houston. When we first arrived at 7:00 am to be checked in. During the bag check time which was 7:05 The agent began to tell me that I and my family was not going to be able to catch our already paid for scheduled flight. Before we even began the bag check I asked the supervisor who was the one servicing us at the time. During our time at BWI. After bag check they failed to let me know that because the bag check took longer to get us in we will have to pay an additional 300 for my family to go enjoy the vacation. Mind you I had already paid for my trip prior to this. During the period between 7:15 and 7:20 I was also informed that there was a delay until 8. Which means they were still boarding ppl. So why did my family have to pay out of pocket again for something that could of simply been solved. Had there been people who were actually doing there job. So I'm asking that me and my family be accommodated for something. The flight they changed without asking was longer and we have a toddler with us. Which made it even more inconvenient for us traveling time wise. I have flown with spirit before. This is the worst experience ever. I wouldn't send the devil here.,-1

2019-04-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chicago,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,3.0,1.0,never fly with them again,False,"  Spirit Airlines is horrible. It is not worth the few bucks you save. I booked a flight leaving Chicago to Orlando Florida on Monday, April 22. We were to return on Saturday, April 27th my birthday mind you. Saturday morning on my birthday I received an email from Spirit stating my flight has been cancelled. I found out it was due to the weather in Chicago. The next flight they could get me going out on Wednesday, May 1st.  I told the representative me and my husband have to go to work on Monday and the kids to school on Monday. They didn't care. No offer to pay for any expenses additional. I have been in this situation before with another airline and they got me on the next flight leaving the next day. Spirit claims they couldn't until days later. I had to rent a car and drive 18 hours back to Chicago! Unbelievable, I will never fly with them again. It's not worth getting stranded and then still having to pay extra money to get home. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for a more reputable company that will be more accommodating should an emergency arises. They nickle and dime you with the bag check fees anyway.",-1

They over book then bump.They constantly delayed flights due to no pilot. Then publish departure times, then leave before it. They charge you for everything from carry on to a bottle of water. And that bottle of water is $3. you would be paying the same price to fly a different airline with your baggage included, be it a check bag or a carry on. They do not accept cash on the plane you have to use a debit card for any purchases as far as snacks or beverages. Some of their staff is just under educated as far as knowledge for the flight, procedures, and so on. Just avoid this airline at all cost.",-1
2019-04-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Philadelphia,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,you don’t have seats,True,"  Atlanta to Philadelphia. First time booking two Spirit tickets ($800). Flight is initially scheduled to depart at 7:53. Then during the day, we get an email saying that the flight is delayed. Now it is scheduled for 8:45. Two hours later we get another email saying the flight is now 9:03. This is where it becomes interesting. We get to the airport 2 hours before the flight, check in, now we get to the gate. We do not have seats assigned so we get to the counter to know what our seats are  “The flight is overbooked, you don’t have seats!” So we paid $400/ticket + $45 for a carry-on to hear “You don’t have seats”. The question I asked the manager was, So what was the money we paid for?  I mean, how can you pay for the ticket, get to the airport on time and potentially not get a seat. That’s absurd. The rude manager and incompetent agents were not making it easy to swallow either. They just do not care. 10 minutes prior flight departure, we finally get seats, not even a simple “sorry”.  Save yourself any type of stress and stay far far far away from this unprofessional airline. Two other passengers were on board, standing in the aisle. They had paid for seats but the seats they had paid for were occupied, so flight attendants had to move the persons (2 seats assigned to two different persons).",-1

Upon boarding the plane to Los Angeles we discovered our seats were given away by the flight attendants even though we paid for the specific ones we wanted, so we weren't able to sit together. We were supposed to fly back to Baltimore on Saturday, 4/20/19 and arrive home on Easter morning. Our flight was cancelled and we were told all other flights to Baltimore were booked up until Tuesday. We ended up having to pay for extra days in a hotel, car rental, food, etc. We asked if we could get a flight to Philadelphia or Richmond and then we'd just drive the rest of the way home. Spirit booked us on a flight for Monday morning from LA to Vegas with a connecting flight from Vegas to Philly. We got up at 3am and boarded the flight at 6am and arrived in Vegas an hour later and sat in the Vegas airport 4 hours only to board the connecting flight, get comfortable in our seats and then have them cancel it. This was our second cancellation. Everyone on the plane raced thru the airport to the ticket counter to reschedule their flights. It took over an hour to get thru the line. When I finally reached the rep, she said Spirit had booked us with American Airlines to fly out on Tuesday morning. They gave us a confirmation number and sent us thru the airport to the American Airlines counter. When we got there, American Airlines said the confirmation number Spirit gave us was not valid and they had no flight booked for us. We had to go back and forth between the 2 airline counters, waiting in line about 6 times. Finally, at 7pm, after being in the airport for 12 hours, the Spirit Airlines supervisor came out and walked us over to the American Airlines counter and personally booked us with them. Me, my mom, my 11 year old son, and my 3 year old son were distraught, hungry and exhausted by that point. Spirit Airlines made our first flight experience a very bad one. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of none is because the flight attendants were very nice and polite and because after that ordeal in the Vegas airport, they did book us in a 4 star Vegas hotel, and gave us taxi and meal vouchers, but they should have done that for all 3 nights, not just one. I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again, I don't care how cheap it is, and after you add the bags and pay for seats it's not even really that cheap. American Airlines on the other hand was excellent and had upgraded planes, so from now on I'll just have to pay the extra to fly with them.",-1

2019-04-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,my flight was cancelled,True,"  On April 18, 2019 I checked into my flight with Spirit Airlines (Atlanta, GA to Tampa, FL) and added a digital copy of my ticket to my phone and went to bed. I had to get up very early for the flight the next day (April 19, 2019) that left around 0600 hrs. I woke up around 0330 hrs. and arrived at the airport approximately 0415 hrs., cleared security and was about to board the tram to head to my gate when I read the flight gate schedule board and saw that my flight was cancelled by Spirit. I was shocked! Every other flight scheduled that day by all airliners, including additional Spirit Airlines flights, were on-time. I immediately called Spirit customer service. I was asked by the Spirit customer service representative if I'd like to fly out tomorrow for an additional $350. I said no, I'd like to fly out today. He replied that it was no issue and that he'd check with Delta Airlines, their ""sister"" company for flights heading to Tampa today (April 19, 2019). Mind you there were two occupants flying, myself and my girlfriend. He offered me two tickets for an additional $900+! I said, no way! The staff member told me the reason why the prices were so high is because I was booking last minute. I advised that the reason why I was booking last minute is because you (Spirit) cancelled my flight! I declined the outrageous offer. They should've been able to compensate me. Instead I was not given a refund. I was not given a flight voucher. Or any reasonable accommodation for the cancelled flight or a way to get to my destination. I was out the money I spent on the tickets on the flight they cancelled. Because of Spirit Airlines I was forced to rent a vehicle and drive 7 hours to Tampa in torrential rainfall, tornadic winds, isolated tornadoes, hail, and flash flooding. Worst airline ever! I do not recommend Spirit Airlines. They place profit over their consumers. It turns out that American flights are horribly “unprotected” for delays and cancellations. Airlines in the US are not required to compensate consumers for delayed flights and cancellations.",-1

The flight attendant told me there wasn't enough crew for the flight to Baltimore. The airline lied and said it was the weather, the weather was fine on the east coast that day. My family and I had to drive 20 hours home, on Easter sunday. The only thing they were willing to do was fly us home 4 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. The didn't offer any compensation for what we spend driving home. The plane seats sucked. This was the worst experience I've ever had with an airline.

From the night before I was receiving email delays in 15 mins increments. Then the next morning, the day I am supposed to depart, the delays continued. I thought okay, maybe there were so weather issues, so I checked the airline to where I would be flying into, and it was nothing going on. So, I said okay, now to note, my flight was scheduled to leave at 9:40pm. I received another notification at 4pm that my flight was cancelled! Can you imagine how upset I was to learn that my flight was cancelled and there was nothing available to book until Monday, April 22, 2019, which was extremely disappointing. The idea of feeling stranded was nerve wrecking. I was in disbelief. I literally had to book with another airline who was able to offer me a flight where I had to pay triple the amount of the trip but at least I got home the day I was supposed to get home.",-1

The next flight out that Spirit offered was two and three days from today. Ridiculous! People have lives, jobs, kids, school, exams and animals to get back to. Spirit offered a lame refund and offered no funds for the extra cost of hotel to stay 3 more nights, or for the dog sitting or rearrange daycare and so forth. Never again will I fly Spirit. We are getting a ride to Las Vegas which is a 5 hour drive and leaves at midnight. Spirit does not care about any customer whatsoever.

2019-04-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Juan via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never will fly Spirit again,True,"  Denver to San Juan via Ft Lauderdale. Terrible. Spirit cancelled our flight 10 hours prior to departure for supposed weather reasons but all other airlines were flying and it was a nice sunny day in Denver. They would only offer a flight 5 days later or a $1000 refund for 5 plane tickets, which obviously was not nearly close to enough to purchase new tickets for me, husband and 3 children. Spent 50 minutes on hold on every call (about 3 calls with 6 different people) and no one could offer anything better or a real reasonable explanation for cancellation. When asked about other flights they were dubious and gave grey answers. Went to the airport and manager was nasty and unhelpful. A second manager, after 5 hours begging, could only offer replacement flight for 3 days later. Had to stay in Denver. No compensation for hotel, food, ect. Manager would not even waive the checked bag fees for the next flight. Just horrible. Never will fly Spirit again!",-1

Flight was late leaving NY, and therefore arrived to Detroit late, which gave us about 5 min to get off plane on to the next plane before flight took off. Knowing this attendants didnt have enough sense to ask everyone to remain seated so passengers could quickly get off plane onto the next one. I nearly had a heart attack trying to run to gate with bags on me. Nevertheless, i just made it, and attendants on the next plane had the nerve to act as if we were someone holding the plane up, so i made the comment, ""if it wasnt for your previous plane being late, i would have been here"". And of course my bags never made it to new plane, so i had to wait until next day to get them. No compassion or apologies whatsoever!",-1

My outbound flight was delayed and my return flight was outright cancelled 30 mins before the scheduled flight out! They said a steward never made it and they wont fly short staffed. There were people on this flight that has their flights cancelled  3 days in a row. My boyfriend was on the flight after mine & they delayed it! He had a connecting flight that he was going to miss because of it and when he asked the ticket counter how they were going to fix the problem they told him deal with it when you get there. They only have a couple flights a day. We didnt risk him being stuck in Dallas so we just booked our own flights for the next day with a different airline and got a refund. There were so many people who after 6 hours waiting, still didnt know how they were going to be accommadated. Not a fun beginning or end to a vacation taken for much needed R&R.",-1

I had planned a 3 day beach vacation as a break from work and stress. Needless to say I still took a day off work only because of stress Spirit created. I had to call customer service to request trip cancellation as well as car rental. The hotel was another matter. I was unable to cancel reservation. It was nonrefundable; however luckily hotel worked with me due to circumstances and rescheduled to November with no penalty. At time of ticket purchase I did buy travel insurance only to learn that was for the flight only. Spirit did refund the total ticket price. The hotel and car was not included. Such a rip off! Never ever again will I chose Spirit. I agree with other comments ""avoid Spirit at all cost"". It really is worst airline ever. They have a limited number of planes and flights. No sister airline to assist with additional flights for those whose flights have been canceled. Poor excuse for airline! If you want uncertainty and disappointment choose Spirit! I wish on survey you could give a ""No star"" rating! They don't even deserve one star!",-1

Besides the fact that there are fees for everything which really makes you wonder the true savings once you add up your fees, their costumer service is awful. When we checked our bags at our return, the lady at the counter was nasty and started charging us for excess weight for all our bags even thought one was only 2 pounds over. We had the same items than on the way there and we had not paid a fee then but this lady was nickle and diming us. The worst part was that while I was busy dealing with the bags, she took my boarding passes which we printed from home to ensure seats were together since we were traveling with a 3 year old and an 8 year old and threw them away and reprinted them with separate seating. Unfortunately, I didn’t notice the change of seats until boarding and no one was able to help by then. I’ll never trust anyone at checking anymore and I will avoid this airline on my next trip.",-1

Delayed the flight and texted me after I was already there and they changed it for 9:30PM after this first delay, they chaged it 20 mins later to 9:50PM and from there it went down every half an hour. Last delay was at 11:50PM we got in the plane and stayed there for an hour when they decided to tell us pilots were leaving because their time fly was expired and they were not allowed to fly anymore. We waited in there for a new pair of pilots to come in and 30 mins later they asked us to get off  the plane and run to the other side of the airport, pass through TSA and catch a ""new flight"". We get to the terminal 81 and we stayed there until 1:10 AM when we finally left the airport. I asked the supervisor if at least they will give us some complimentary water he said we don't have any. I lost my car rental because by the time we arrived at the other airport everything was closed 3:00AM and had to wait there until 6:30 that they reopened.",-1
2019-04-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to Ft  Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,"  Worst experience ever. I was travelling with a friend and two babies. Our evening flight was cancelled due to bad weather, (which there was no bad weather at all), out of Fort Lauderdale. The flight was then re-scheduled for 6:00 am the next morning. The airline would not cover our $140 hotel bill nor would they give us any help with food. The next morning our 6:00 am flight was again cancelled. We stood in long lines with two extremely tired and cranky babies and were told the flight crew did not show up. We again stood in line trying to get our flight re-booked for the second time!. They booked me and the two babies for a flight which would entail us waiting in the airport for another 14 hours or paying for yet another hotel bill. Then they told my friend that they could not guarantee he could fly with us and booked him standby. Have you ever tried flying with a tired one year old and two year old alone? We were livid. I don't trust that we will make it out of here together tonight and at this point we are totally stressed and exhausted. To top it off the flight this evening has been re-routed through an out of the way city which will extend the flight time by a couple of hours. Never again will I try to save money by flying Spirit. Book with them at your own risk! I advise anyone reading this to seriously think before booking with this Airline or be ready to possibly hand added expenses and a lot of stress.",-1

2019-04-22,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Orlando,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I was impressed,True," I have to say: I was a little nervous flying Spirit Airlines for a last minute business flight from Pittsburgh to Orlando but bit the bullet and went. I have nothing but great tings to say! On the way down, the Captain came out, talked to us, welcomed us, was funny, thanked us, told us how the airlines had let people down in the past and they are aware of it and wanting to make Spirit an airline people trust and want to fly. My go-to is Southwest but I have to say: I was impressed! I told them so on the way out of the plane. On the way home from Orlando, the Captain came out before the flight again and welcomed us. He wasn't as personable but hey, I appreciate the effort. The flight attendants both ways were awesome! No, you don't get food unless you pay but you know that before you get on. And it was a non-stop. Who doesn't love a non-stop flight? Overall, I will travel Spirit again in one split second. The aisles to get in the plane were actually 'wide' so you could move easily thru the plane. And the check in was super easy. Everything was easy. And if you needed help with checking in yourself at the self kiosks, the attendants there were standing by to help you with a smile on their face and a great attitude. So, with their renewed attitudes: do it. You won't be sorry!",1

Spirit has constant flight delays, cancellations, and their check in booths are a complete mess. Spirit will delay and cancel their flights without a valid reason and their check in booths are always over flowing and with people trying to rebook their flights. Originally, I had planned to go on vacation for six days, but due to Spirits lacking system it was cut short to four days.  I wasted so much money on the unrefundable hotel and rental cars for the two days I missed due to Spirit canceling my flight. I understand that occasionally flights must be delayed due to weather however my flight was delayed four hours because the crew was not ready. This just goes to show that Spirit Airlines is poorly managed and has an inconsistent schedule. Overall, if you want to get to your destination on time and peacefully, then absolutely do not take Spirit Airlines.",-1

This has been the worst experience I've ever have had with an airline. I've never been delay for the most dumbest reason I've ever heard. So, this flight has been delay for almost 3 hours due to the crew is stuck in traffic. From my understanding everyone including the crew should be responsible to leave their home with enough time to make it on time to the airport. And then you can go no where because they keep telling you that they should arrived within 15 minutes, but it has been exactly 3 hours! Worst airline ever.

The plane had what looked like new plastic shell seats with fairly thin padding. Very uncomfortable and very little leg room. The check in process was easy. The flight was originally very cheap but as this was a family emergency I had to move the trip up a week. It no longer was an inexpensive flight and I paid regular price for an uncomfortable trip. If you can’t stand hard uncomfortable seating avoid spirit.,-1
2019-04-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Chicago,,,,,,,1.0,Spirit cancelled the flight,True,  Dallas to Chicago. I and my wife and two children had a reservation for an early Thursday morning flight. Spirit cancelled the flight within 12 hours of departure without a reason why. Spirit tried to offer a connecting flight the day after our original departure day. We would have been on two flights and waiting in an airport with a 4-month old and an 18-month old. That is inhuman and unjust. Spirit has lost our business and should be ashamed. We should have known better than to trust this sorry excuse for an airline.,-1

This airline is terrible! Claims baggage fees and no drinks on plane except to purchase is due to their low fare, that's wrong we should have a complimentary drink at least water without purchase!

Worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline in all my years of traveling. I attempted to check in online as I always do, received an error message and was instructed to speak to an attendant prior to boarding. I travel with a service animal and I have to take precautions when arriving to the airport, I arrived 45 minutes before departure to the airport, they told me that I had missed my flight and that there was nothing to do, the front desk manager treated me with zero respect. I know this isn’t policy for them to close down check in so early before the flight. I called customer service,  that was no help in booking another flight or helping with the fee that it entails.",-1

Spirit Airline is a disgrace to the airline industry. Even in their international flights, chairs do not tilt, the trays are so small you can not have even a small plate on it. There are no chargers, no radio, no TV, and extremely uncomfortable to seat and impossible to sleep. There is no free service at any kind... even the water is for sale. We missed our connecting flight from Florida to Maryland, because their aircraft was delayed out of Bogota. So we had to stay in Florida one night but they’re didn’t accommodate for anything!",-1

The airline had a layover in Chicago for more then 6 hours. Bags were expensive, no details were given on why there was a delay other then “they need to check if they have enough gas,” and their back up computer might be crashing. That alone left me with zero confidence in a safe trip to New York. We taxied for over an hour to return to the gate. The ride was for the most part smooth, until landing which was horrible. To top it off, when we landed we couldn’t even get your gate right away. We only get a half cup of water in this whole experience from the airline. I would never recommend this airline again. The cheaper option is NOT worth it.",-1

I bought 2 Spirit Airlines Ticket April 12, 2019 at 3 PM for $1,346.52. This was a Round Trip Ticket from LAX to Detroit Michigan and back to LAX. I bought this ticket for a Military Funeral. When I tried to do my Online check in on Sunday, Spirit Airlines was telling me my confirmation code was invalid. I then called Spirit airlines and was on hold for an hour until I finally got through to someone at 8pm. (My flight was supposed to take off at 10:59 PM) When they tried to use the confirmation code I gave them Spirit found out they double booked me with another person. They then gave me the corrected confirmation code. Once, I got  my ticket I immediately left for LAX from Chino Hills. Well, I was late and I could not board the flight. I then talked to the Spirit airlines Supervisor at LAX,  and she advised me to call Spirit Reservations. So I called Spirit Airlines and detailed my case to the Reservations Supervisor. He then told me that Spirit Airlines does not refund under any circumstances. I am just asking for a refund. I bought this to go to a funeral and the next available flights would have resulted to miss the funeral in Michigan by a whole day.",-1
2019-04-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Guayaquil via Ft Lauderdale,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly them again,True,"  Horrible. The check in and bag drop off in Orlando was completely disorganized. The kiosks for check-in block the line for dropping off checked luggage. At the connection in Ft Lauderdale the flight was cancelled because of poor coordination by Spirit and they did not have a plane ready. They had all passengers go back to the check-in desk where it took nearly twenty minutes per passenger to print a new boarding pass for a flight the following day and print meal vouchers. The agents claimed the company was working on securing a hotel and that passengers needed to stand by and wait for them to announce when a hotel was secured. A couple hours later, I learned they had hotel vouchers, they just weren’t printing them unless pressured into doing so. I fully believe the agents were instructed to deliberately stall printing the hotel vouchers so that passengers would get frustrated and pay for their own stay (as at least a few did). Sprite is the worst airline I’ve ever come across and will never fly them again.",-1

Just boarded my first Spirit Airlines flight with my two kids and wife. Have round trip tickets from Vegas to Boston. We just got charged $260 for 4 small carryon bags.

This was our first time flying Spirit Airlines and it was absolutely a pleasant experience. The seats on the plane provided ample space and our flight attendants were absolutely amazing.  They were very nice and accommodating of any request we made. It seemed as though they truly enjoyed their jobs and serving others. We were so pleased with the service that we applied for the rewards Mastercard as we definitely plan on flying with Spirit Airlines again. We just hope we bump into these guys again. The level of customer service they provided definitely stood out.,1
2019-04-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Indianapolis,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,disappointed to say the least,True,"  Orlando to Indianapolis. My family and I have decided to try Spirit for our trip this Spring break. We recommended you guys as well to a few friends booking trips around the same time.  We had scheduled 4 flights: 1-) Indy-Orlando (03/28) (4 people)- Everything was good. 2-) Orlando to Saint Thomas (04/04) (6 people) - Flight delayed a little over 2 hours. We had arrangements that had to be made last minute to accommodate the change. Although it was inconvenient, we made it work out. 3-) Saint Thomas - Orlando (04/07) (6 people): Everything went pretty smooth, although customer service in Saint Thomas was pretty bad. I am very laid back, had 2 simple questions and was answered in a very careless and non-professional manner. Flight was overbooked. 4-) Orlando-Indy (04/08) (4 people): We has our gates change at least 8 times. Some of the times we weren’t even notified. Our flight was supposed to leave at 5:20. We left close to 10. Customer service was horrible. Communication was horrible. No one could tell us what was going on. Lots of commotion due to a family being removed from another flight after they had boarded. Gate changed 10 min before boarding to a completely different side of the airport causing a ton of disturbance on all passengers. We had 2 kids under 6 with us that were hungry, tired. We all had commitments early today, hence the decision to take the earliest flight available. During all of the wait in Orlando we listened to many people complaining about the very same no information-constant inconvenient changes to flights-overbooking-people getting removed from airplanes after boarding stories amongst others. I too work with customer service, and I despise the loud people complaining all over social media and such about bad experiences they had. I never believed it got anyone anywhere. However, I was completely shocked with the lack of care and efforts to make up to the horrible wait, frustration and inconvenience caused. We were told by the crew a few times that they would make it up to us, and they offered a cup of water and a cookie for free while we were waiting (some of us hungry) in the airplane. It was a nearly 5 hours delay. Also, the flight was overbooked. I didn’t realize we got a survey after the 2 flights that were smooth, but didn’t get one after the two delayed ones. That makes me doubt your intentions. We have family in Florida, and we travel a bit. We are having a hard time considering Spirit in the future. I have 3 planned trips before the end of the year (so far) with all together 9 people each way. We had all budget to go through Spirit, but that may change. I understand things go wrong. I just can’t understand the lack of care for trying to make up for the unfortunate things happening. I am disappointed to say the least. Since I had no change to fill out a survey about all of my experiences, I came here to register it. Unfortunately, I don’t think we can recommend Spirit to anyone again, and probably won’t do it ourselves either.",-1

You are charged $40/bag on line, $55.00/bag at ticket counter, $65.00/bag at gate. We booked 2 bags on line at a cost of $160.00. Our flight from LAS to PDX was overbooked by 8 seats. The desperate gate agent promised a voucher for $500.00 in cash plus a future travel voucher. Both my daughter and I individually verified with her that this was the case. She gave us four 17 digit numbers which she said could be redeemed for $250.00 cash increments. Meanwhile, they took a terribly upset woman with children involuntarily off the flight. As promised, we were put on the next day's flight to PDX which of course, was overbooked. Later we found out Spirit does not give cash. The gate agent was clearly desperate and misrepresented the offer. Finally, my legs were tight up against the seat in front. Spirit is disorganized, chaotic and misrepresents. They will not last long.",-1

I was schedule to fly out Friday the 5th however due to a death in the family. Which happen a day before. I contacted Spirit and All the kept saying was that I had a non-refundable ticket. Which I was well aware. I talk to another lady she said that Needed to email the newspaper article. I emailed the necessary information. I received a email that they need a death certificate or a obituary so they can research t further. This is very insensitive when I have to worry about more important things. It’s not about the money it’s the principle. I am at a lost of words.,-1
2019-04-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston via Atlanta,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,never fly this awful airline again,True,"  Good from LAX to Houston but Houston to Atlanta a complete nightmare. Seats are small had no space with a north face bookbag legs were very uncomfortable seat has almost no cushioning like a race car bucket seat. Had a 7hr layover in Houston which I will never do  again. Once on the plane nothing is complimentary you have to pay for everything, even for water. Once I landed in Atlanta had to walk across the airport because the train was not working or under construction I don't know why it wasn't running but once at baggage claim had to wait 45 mins for my bag will never fly this awful airline again.",-1
2019-04-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas. I will never fly Spirit again. I first had trouble when adding baggage to my booking. The advertisement stated that if I purchased the nine dollar fare club membership that I would only be charged half price for my bags. However the standard price was $40 I still want to paint $31 per bag each way. Well I realize that this was a discount it was not the discount promised for the signing up of the membership. So by the time I purchased both bags at $62 both ways plus the $60 membership I had wind up spending more than I would have by just booking the baggage at $40 per bag each way. When traveling back to Fort Worth we got to the bed stand in our bags were not there so when I spoke with the very rude baggage claim handler, Her response to me was simple “There was no more bags coming and she was unsure where my bag was.” I’ve been explained to her that I have blown several airlines and I have never had my back is lost so I was unsure of what to do in the situation. She She then came out of her office stated that they had found a bag on the plane and they would be sending it out. We then waited 10 minutes for this bed to come and it was not even ours. So I stress this to her she came in close to your office door and went back and said her computer. At that point I wanna knock on the door and asked what do I do? I’ve been informed her that this is my husband’s first time flying and he had placed his cell phone as well as his wallet inside of the bag in hopes that it would return home with us. She then starts yelling at me stating that you should never do that you’re supposed to keep your things with you at all times. So at this point I got upset and I told her will my bags were supposed to get here with me. I’ve then asked to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor was very nice and explained to me that I would file a report, go home and they would search for my bags and let me know if and when they had found them. They called me the very next day at 9 AM stating that they had found my luggage and that it was still in Las Vegas. That it would be flying in on a plane at 1:45 landing here in DFW. So at this time I had gotten up at a bed and I was going to drive to the airport to pick up my luggage but I wanted to call to make sure that the luggage had actually landed at that time when I got on the phone the lady stated to me that they had a delivery service and because of the inconvenience that they were delivered to my house we have charge. Well great designate trip to the airport right? So when they stated that he would be delivering it I was fine with it until three at 3 PM came around so I called and I asked where my bag was because I had been waiting. She then stated he picked it up at 3 o’clock and he has 4 to 6 hours to deliver it to your house which from 3 PM that would be 9 o’clock so of course what do we do we wait for nine. 9 o’clock comes around I called no answer the guy calls from the delivery service and says hey I will should be to your house between 11 and 12 AM. I then Said to him that I was told that you picked it up at 3 PM and you should have been here by nine. He didn’t inform me that he had only clocked in at 6:45 PM so there is no way that he could have my bags there by 9 PM. So end of the day he comes knocking on my door the next day at 1:18 AM to deliver that bag. Worst experience ever I will never fly Spirit again.",-1
2019-04-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1.0,I do not recommend Spirit,False,"  Columbus to Orlando. Although Spirit airlines offer one of the cheapest fares, it comes out bogus! One has to pay for his seat and/or pay for a carry on item before one is assured that he has a seat on the plane. We recently travelled to Orlando. Night before, we checked in on line, we were not successful. We called customer service who could not figure out why. We got to the kiosk the following day- same as usual, could not check in. We ended up talking to a staff who checked us in but when in the pre boarding area we were denied and were told that we were last to check in thats why we could not take the plane. After my husband intervened, thats when the staff started offering to volunteers to surrender their seats wait for another plane to take them to Orlando in a much later time. Luckily, there were nice passengers who did. Spirit airlines should not subject their passengers or customers in this kind if situation! Many years ago, we encountered an unpleasant experience with the same company and i told myself, i will not take Spirit airlines anymore. This time we had to because of our hectic schedule and we also had to take the same flight with other family members. I thought we would not be encountering problems anymore hoping there would be some improvements. My husband and I travel several times a year so we have taken different airlines and we hardly encounter problems. Other cons: seats do not recline, airline tables are as short as half of the regular palm, no inflight entertainment, no ports on the seats, refreshments are all for sale, no complementaries, staff gives instructions very fast that one hardly comprehends, ground crew talk among them selves uses their native tongue i front of customers, checkin kiosk and luggage process is not well organize, very few kiosk and out of the six in cmh, 2 were not working; I cannot rely on Spirit Airlines anymore. What they are charging and how their treating their customers are taking their spirit from doing business with them! I do not recommend Spirit airlines to anyone",-1
2019-04-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Austin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,ill never fly Spirit again,True,"  Las Vegas to Austin. I will never fly Spirit again. I received an email that stated the flight was delayed 1 hour. My original flight was at 12:45 am, I arrived to the airport at 10pm and checked in, 2 hours and 45 minutes ahead of the original flight time. We sat down the corridor as the area around the gates had no seating. With myself and my wife listening we never heard an announcement to board. But we did receive another email from Spirit at 1:14 am stating the flight was delayed till 1:45 am. We walk over to an empty terminal where a rude attendant tells me they boarded 10 minutes prior and left. When asked why I can clearly hear names and boarding calls why we did not hear anything, she insisted that they had announced the flight. So they booked us next available flight 24 hours later. When I called the airline to complain there was no announcement and the situation I am now in, she said she was sorry but nothing at all could be done except take a note I said there was no announcement. I ended up booking a flight with another airline. The only thing positively I can say about the airline was that on my way to Vegas the flight crew and pilots were great.",-1
2019-04-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Pittsburgh,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,first and the last time,True,"  Fort Myers to Pittsburgh. My husband, our two sons and I were traveling home after a wonderful vacation in Florida when I was unforgivably embarrassed by not 1, not 2 but 3 Spirit Customer Service Reps at the gate. I’ve never ever ever in my life been talked to or treated so poorly by customer service reps before like I was today at the gate. My husband and I bought all 4 tickets at the same time; however, we did not get to choose our seats until last evening. My husband and our youngest son boarded first as their tickets indicated they were in Zone 1. My eldest son and I’s tickets indicated we were to board with Zone 3. As we were standing in line, a male customer service rep came up to me and in an extremely condescending tone asked me how many bags I was taking on the plane. It was obvious that I was taking on three as all three bags (my purse, a camera bag and our carry-on luggage) was in front of me. So I replied, 3. He then took the boarding pass that was in my hand and looked at it advising me that I was in Zone 3. I had no idea what this meant, as I’ve never flown with Spirit before. Before I could even advise him that I took the carry-on from my husband because he has our younger son, he began reprimanding me advising me because I did not pay for the carryon to be checked in at the ticket counter that I would now have to pay more. I asked why I wasn’t allowed to take a carry-on onto the plane but the other 100 people that was standing around me was. This response obviously hit a nerve with him, because his already negative tone with me, got even worse. He told me that I must place one of my other two bags in the carry-on or I had to pay for one of them. I agreed to do so. As I was closing up my carry-on with my purse now inside it, he stomped back over to me and asked me and advised me that the carry-on now exceeded the size that a carry-on was permitted to be and that I’d have to pay for it or I could leave it behind. Now, that this charade had gone on for 10 minutes and I was utterly embarrassed by the attention this very unpleasant man was causing, I advised him that I wanted my husband who already boarded the plane to come off and speak to him. As I asked this, a women who had been behind the gate counter advised me to come to the counter. Once at the counter with my eldest son, three Spirit Customer Service reps were reprimanding we, I was so embarrassed and upset that I was shaking. After I asked a few more times to speak with my husband and they refused to allow me because he was already on the plane, a gentleman who was checking boarding passes for the passengers who were boarding asked me for his name and went and got him. What happened was, my husband who had boarded in Zone 1 only took a personal item with him so he could take care of our youngest son. Since we had never flown Spirit before, we did not realize, he should have taken the carry-on with him. Apparently, Zone 1 passengers pay more to bring a personal item and a carry-on onto the plane. Zone 2-4 are only allowed a personal item. If the extremely rude customer service reps would’ve explained this to me from the beginning I could’ve resolved all of this by advising them that my husband had not taken on a carry-on as he was permitted to do so as a Zone 1 passenger. Needless to say, this was the first and the last time I will EVER fly Spirit Airlines. It’s a shame, because the flight attendants were extremely nice and were very apologetic to us when I was finally permitted to board.",-1

I was wondering why the price of the flight was only $563 each way, travelling from New Orleans to Houston. I had no idea the price of checking a bag was so expensive. You get nothing for free with this airline, not even a complimentary snack. The price to check a bag is automatically $40 and that is only if you pay online. If not it will be $50. I spent $216 on a trip that was originally priced at $126. I will never fly Spirit again.",-1

I have flown Spirit on two separate occasions in the last month, once to the Virgin Is., once to LA, and on both trips we had one leg on which the aircraft was returned to the gate, and deplaned for mechanical problems.

They may have cheap flights but it all ends there! They are the only airline that charges you to take rum back to the states from St. Croix. Why...so they can make up for their cheap ticket. Not only do they nickel and dime you, really very rude flight attendants both coming and going. I'm not certain where they think they are working but pull your nose out of the air and look around. You are working for Spirit which is the equivalent of Walmart but Walmart employees are much kinder.",-1
2019-03-28,0.7,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Atlantic City,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,4.0,pay exactly for what you need,True,"  After 10 years plus of not flying Spirit I decided to give them a chance for this short 2 1/2 hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlantic City. They are pretty straightforward and I paid for the things that I need it like the pre-reclined “Big Front Seat” which was very nice. Spirit still needs to work a lot on customer service as it was extremely poor during the flight and at the airport in FLL. I do like their young fleet of airplanes and that they get you to and where you need to go mostly avoiding big crowded airports, you pay exactly for what you need, and their MasterCard is pretty decent. If they get their crew to be more friendly and smile that would make the entire experience much better. I do have to say that after 10+ years of not flying with them the experience has gotten better, I’ll fly again and see how it goes. Here’s to hoping for the best for Spirit Airlines.",1
2019-03-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Pittsburgh,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,customer service is non existent,True," Spirit's customer service is non existent. They give their staff no tools or options to even help the customers. If there's a problem, they just hand us a card with an 1800 number which when I call, I'm on hold for 30 minutes, and then no issues are actually resolved. My issue in particular was when I missed my flight, notified Spirit I would be purchasing a direct flight with another airline and then found out, as I attempted to return to my destination, that they cancelled my returning flight with no notification. Not even an email. I paid for two separate flights and they tried to squeeze more money out of me by forcing me to purchase ANOTHER ticket on the same flight to return home. They are simply the worst.",-1

I am writing this review at the Atlanta airport since I have nothing better to do because I’ve been waiting over an hour for my bags to come out of the carousel. I had to pay $40 to check my bag which was a small duffle bag and would’ve been considered a free carry on at any other airline, but spirit charges for carry ons so a checked bag was the cheapest option. Now I’m left here extremely disappointed at the customer service, the cost of the flight, and how this inconvenience has completely screwed up my travel planes. I will never be flying spirit again.",-1
2019-03-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,2.0,first and last time,True,"  Newark to Orlando. I was advised that it would cost $23 to check my back and I had no problem with that. I was not advised that I needed to check my bag on line before I got to the airport. Therefore I was charged $50 to check my bag. I couldn't even do it at the kiosk since all of them were down. They wanted to charge me $10 because I didn't print out my boarding pass. The woman gave me my receipt instead of my boarding pass and I had to come all the way back to have one printed. When I got to Orlando they put my luggage on the wrong carousel. Once I located it, I was unable to get it as the luggage was backed up and the people working there had walked away. thank heavens for a man who was brave enough to walk on the carousel to get it. This is my first and last time I will ever fly Spirit",-1
2019-03-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Baltimore,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,4.0,2.0,nickel and dime you for everything,True,"  I purchased a return flight from Vegas to Baltimore after enjoying a vacation with brother for March Madness. Although the airfare was a great deal, it turns out no so much. I don’t get why an airline would rather nickel and dime you for everything imaginable versus providing a airfare that’s truly the fair to travel excluding luggage of course. This is a breakdown of my recent Spirit Airline flight: Airfare: $200.00 Check Bags: $92.00 (two bags under 80 pounds each) Seat Purchase: $17.00 Assistance at counter during checkin; $10.00 Total: $319.00 Snacks / water: All for sale (flight includes nothing) Service: unpleasant and I don’t think they care So why not quote a fare that’s truly your airfare. It’s deceiving how this company goes about their business and I would highly recommend any airline over this experience of flying Sprit Airline. If noting else, at least be pleasant however the Person assisting me was unpleasant. I’ll give her credit for allowing me to use her pen and she didn’t charge me. Good luck to anyone willing to fly this airline but I won’t again.",-1

Big big mistake. Fees for everything from bags to seats to check-in. Final bill was greater than other better options. Nothing is easy with this airline. Please fully understand that no-frills means they provide nothing, not even decent customer service for free. Rude, unhelpful gate staff, refused to answer any questions regarding flight delays, connections or other available options.

It’s surprising to see people show up not knowing that your bags will cost money, your check bag weight is 40lbs, and not knowing that you will pay for everything outside of your seat. It’s a cheap ticket for a reason. I found no big differences between flying on Spirit versus another airline besides your leg room is reduced by a couple inches, you save money, and your plane is yellow.",1
2019-03-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Guatemala to Orlando, FL",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I don't recommend Spirit at all,True," Let me start by saying Spirit has absolutely the worst customer service of any airline I've ever flown with. I had a flight scheduled from Guatemala to Orlando with an arrival time to Orlando of 10.30pm. I arrived at the airport gate on time. No agents were on duty. Only to receive 12 email notifications that my flight was being delayed and then cancelled due to a mechanical issue with the plane. By the time they cancelled the flight I would have been arriving at my destination. 2.5 hours before my flight was cancelled, I called customer service to try and get an update because I had a connection to Hawaii and another to Australia. I explained to 7, yes 7 people who kept passing me around the same department, giving me no options that would allow me to make my connection, therefore causing me to miss my 2 additional flights in cost of over $2000. After 7 people I demanded to speak to a supervisor who only offered an apology and to talk to an agent at the gate. At this point I had been on the phone for 2 hours and no agents had been assigned to the gate and asked to speak to another supervisor. This gentleman was the worst of them all. He told me he would refund my cancelled flight. Then I explained by missing my connection it would cost me well over $2000 to rebook my next two flights last minute and it was not acceptable to me that due to an issue on the airliness part that their customer, would be penalized by thousands of dollars due to no fault of my own. He hung up on me. Finally agents showed up at the gate and apologized. Only offering to rebook my flight for the next day. If they had cancelled my flight earlier I could have gotten a different flight through another airline and not have missed my connection. The fact that me, their customer, was missing 2 very expressive connections, was not of any priority to anyone I spoke to and was advised to write an email to customer service. Needless to say I don't recommend Spirit at all, to anyone. Customers pay for a service and if a company cannot complete the service due to faulty machinery on their part, they should have accountability for the repercussions of their customers. I don't believe anyone on the flight that was cancelled will ever use Spirit again. Beyond ridiculous.",-1

I will never ever travel with this airline again. I paid almost $600 for the ticket you would think luggage is included like other airlines - no, I had to pay extra $120 for 1 carry one and 1 check in. If you travel with someone just to make sure you sit with them you have to pay for your seats. I had to pay for a meal even water on the plane. Customer service was a terrible experience for me.",-1
2019-03-22,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,friendly flight attendants,True," Purchased flight on March 3. Everyone has mixed feelings about this airline but I wanted to see for myself. Of course, to not be surprised by hefty fees at the airport it’s best to purchase everything online at booking. Yes, everything. From your luggage, carryon to your seat. Being as though Spirit is a budget airline, you have to pay for everything a la carte, which allows for more space for luggage and passengers (as I was told). Downloaded the app to be more efficient but, it barely worked and customer service over the phone barely spoke English so I just rolled with the bunches. Received my itinerary via email days prior. Flown to Fort Lauderdale, FL on Wednesday March 13 from Baltimore, Md. Prior to checking in, I had issues logging into my app (and online. Not sure why). Checked in at home the night before, just to make sure I had time for TSA the day of. Got to BWI, and was greeted by easy to use kiosks to print out boarding passes and luggage tags. Easy right? Yup Turned my bag in and headed to TSA, which was pretty packed but it was also 5am so it was to be expected. Headed to the gate, and saw that their terminal was fairly small, but clean. Boarding was a breeze, as I was in Zone 1. Greeted by friendly flight attendants and the pilot and co-pilot. Finding my seat was easy, even though I should have selected a window seat but oh well. Aircraft was super clean and well lit, but extremely cold, even when I turned the vents off. Seats are a bummer though. They do not recline and they aren’t as padded as Southwest or American but fairly comfortable for what we pay for. Seat tray in front was super tiny and barely have leg room, unless you pay for the “Big seat” up front or select row 25, which is the exit. Take off was smooth and we actually arrived at Fort Lauderdale 15 early. Flight back home was a breeze too, however the flight was over sold from what I overheard. Attendants were super sweet and aircraft was clean as well My overall experience with Spirt was a great one.",1

I've been travelling with JetBlue, American Airlines and other airlines for a very long time, however, I think I travelled with Spirits Airlines probably about 12 years ago. This time after all those years I took a risk to fly again only because my trip was arranged at the last minute given me no option but to fly with them. This time I realised that not only it's cheaper in some cases but the service is terrible. Absolutely everything has a cost! Even soft drinks including water, coffee and tea! Not to mention the fact that the chairs are the most uncomfortable, even the big chains offer at extra cost! I'm sure next they'll be charging to use the aircraft's toilets! Cheap becomes expensive. Sorry Spirits but not flying again even if it's free!",-1

My son was flying by himself, he was at the gate an hour and half early. The plane was boarding and when he got to the gate he was told to move to the side and wait until everyone boards the plane because he will be last to get on. Actual words, “ oh no you have to move to the side and wait, you’ll be last to get on”. He then has to wait another 15 minutes at the gate after everyone has boarded the plane to board the flight. Once he is finally on the plane stewardess removes another passenger out of their seat to make room for my son to have a seat. So not only are you making an experience bad for an unaccompanied minor you have now inconvenienced another passenger. Very rude and very unprofessional.",1

Horrible when someone calls you a liar after all the hassle getting to gate. I was told my bag was no problem, no charge. Get to gate I was told they would never say that.

Horrible customer service and very unprofessional. Workers at gate made rude remarks and were whining about how difficult their job is which I'm sure it is but it is not for one to use it as an excuse to be rude to customers. This was our first time at this large airport and traveling with a toddler and yet the lady at the gate had to throw in how we were the last people boarding and that 200 hundred others made it on time. Very unnecessary especially without knowing everything we had been through that morning. Very upsetting and disheartening. I would rate my experience as a 0 if possible. If only I could have recorded her horrible words.,-1

Was at the gate 17 minutes ahead of time and they were announcing last call and were closing the door so we went up and got a “sorry I already closed the door” from the girl at the gate. The door just closed and the plane did not move for almost 20 more minutes after, yet we couldn’t get another flight until the following night - definitely will not use them again.",-1
2019-03-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Fort Lauderdale via Hartford,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,really did not care,False,  I had a layover in Fort Lauderdale going to Hartford and we were stuck on runway for 45 minutes because the plane had no place to dock. When the plane finally docked me and about 8 other passengers ran to the Hartford gate only to find out the gates were closed. Although the plane was still there. The staff for Spirit was no help at all and didn’t seem to even care about my well being. I waited in customer service for an hour and a half to reschedule a flight for the next morning. Spirit offered me no place to stay at all. This shouldn’t have happened in the first place at all. There other flight should have been notified of the plane being on the runway for 45 minutes but it was not done at all. Once again the customer service agents really did not care. They essentially said to me your on your own for now. It is extremely safe to say that I will never be doing business with Spirit Airlines again. For future reference I recommend you communicate better with your other flights and staff about situations like this because this is ridiculous.,-1

I though the delays were to fix it like they said they would? And also I thought they would change our airplane if they couldn’t fix it like they said? What a bunch of liars, I’m still here along with the rest of the clients in the airplane finding a way for us to reach our destination as soon as possible because vouchers for future flights is not acceptable! It’s disrespectful to even think I would use this airline again, Bottom line horrible experience, horrible customer service horrible in general. Stay away.",-1

I tried calling Spirit but kept getting disconnected. I was also getting charged cancellation fees. I went to Spirit in DIA the ticket agent gave me a different flight that didn’t meet any of my preferences and charged me over twice the amount I originally paid for. She said anything else would cost over $400.00 thinking I didn’t have a choice I took it. Shortly leaving I had a feeling to check there availability I found one that meet my needs and $100 cheaper. I was already driving home on bad roads and decided to call when I got to a stopping point. Could not get through until 1am the agent wanted to charge me an $152 on what I had already paid. I decided to call a manager. He would not help because I was out of the 24 hour period. I told him when I first got through it was 1am not out of the 24 hour period. This did not mater. All in all my flight that cost $116 turns to $352 . I spent several hours on hold, I was stuck in Denver for two nights because of weather, I was lied to taken advantage of, Very bad customer service. I understand they cannot control weather and there are extra fees to change flights but when someone has already paid for a service but when a cyclone hits you should help people not take advantage of them.

I paid $65.00 and make me pay so much money for minors things; also in situations that a person do not have a money for those hidden charges they don't give a chance to flight so that mean that person lost the flight and the money plus the embarrassing moment they went through in from of everyone. those people don't have sensitivity they are trained to making money for the airline.

When we arrived for the flight, we were met with rude customer service reps, who immediately told us we were unable to book the flight, & that the airline was full because of Spring Break. My husband had to forfeit his $400 ticket altogether, & I had to pay $99 to fly out the next day, separate from him, altogether. I have never been so ripped off by a company in my entire life! One of the same customer service reps was working the next daycare & was rude when I asked her a question. We contacted customer service via phone & email, & were basically just told, ""oh well if you can't check in on the flight,"" you need to be at the airport a full 2 hours early. They did absolutely nothing to rectify this issue. Please steer clear of this airline! Also you do not get included snacks/ drinks on the plane, & you have to pay for any carry on luggage. The baggage fees are insane, & if anything happens, Spirit will not try to fix the issue, but blame you entirely. I also tried to check in yesterday, for my flight today, & got the same error message. They are the ones with the technology that does not work, but yet they blame the customer for missing the flight. Another thing is that it was 45 minutes before the plane was set to take off, when they wouldn't let us board.

By the time Spirit Airlines finishes nickeling and diming the passenger, the flight ended up being twice the cost of the ticket’s face value. Carry on bag? $40 Checked bag? $45 bag three pounds over? $60 Then one discovers the plan has a mechanical malfunction. We hope that we leave sometime today. The staff are also surly.

I have flown with them many times because my dad always books with them to fly me to and from Florida. They have the worst customer service that barely speaks english and they never know what they are talking about. I was on hold for 45 mins before somebody finally answered and they “couldnt” help me because they didnt know how. Awful company. You get what you pay for,-1

Unprofessional customer service, takes 30 min on hold to reach someone on phone. Will not be flying this so called airline again",-1

I have a personal item that measures the exact measurements on their website for that item. I know this because I use it nearly every week ok Frontier with no issues, and their measurements are supposed to be the same. It fits into the bin for measuring the bags and everything. Upon arriving today, the told me I would need to pay $65 for this bag as a carry on and when I went to measure the bag, it did not fit. I seriously doubt that the retractable handle for my luggage grew longer since I flew frontier last week. Spirit is clearly using smaller bins than their advertised sizes for measuring carry ons. I literally paid nearly as much for my bag as my ticket. The lady that screwed me over didn’t even feel bad. I could tell this was pretty much the status quo for Spirit. Also, boarding was moved up half an hour without any notice. Thank god I didn’t waste any time at the airport or I would have missed my flight too.",-1
2019-03-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,Horrible experience,True,"  Los Angeles to Atlanta. I booked a trip to fly to Atlanta last Friday and came back yesterday (Monday) and I have a big complaint about how pilots scare people before we start flying by saying things like, the aircraft has mechanical issues! On the first flight this is what the pilot said: “we had some mechanical issues on our last flight but we are going to try our best to get you guys safe to Atlanta”. Really? You are going to try your best to get me safe? I wanted to get out of there, but it was too late to do that. On the flight back home, it was the same thing, pilot scared us saying that the aircraft is with mechanical issues again! Is it necessary to address mechanical issues right before the flight? Some of us have a hard time flying as it is. I didn’t feel safe and I don’t think I’ll be taking this airline again, they shouldn’t do that with us. They charge even if you want to drink water, seats don’t recline at all. Super uncomfortable. Horrible experience.",-1
2019-03-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Oakland via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,1.0,miserable travel experience,True,"  Houston to Oakland via Los Angeles. I have been traveling via airplane since I was 5 years old, I am now 47 years old. In my late 20's I literally flew to a different city every single weekend from January to May for 6 years for work. Our company never splurged and flew us first-class or even business-class. Not to mention the fact that it was never the same airline. The ticket purchased was based on whichever airline offered the cheapest ticket. I was always in coach and can honestly say that I never got off the plane and thought, ""Wow, that was an amazing and relaxing flight"". There were many times I was uncomfortable and complained about the experience. I can honestly say that flying on Spirit Airlines was worse than any flying experience I have ever encountered. Not only are the seats literally the most uncomfortable plane seats I have sat in (they don't recline even 1 centimeter and the head rest is so large that your neck is bent forward for the entire flight), but they have the audacity to charge for every possible thing imaginable. So don't be fooled by the ""low"" airfare. Cheap is definitely the description I would use. You will end up paying double that by the time you are done. The only thing free is ice, but if you want water with that it will cost you $3--for water! You must pay for your carry-on as well as your checked luggage. You must pay for your window seat selection even if there are plenty of open seats available. It was by far the most miserable travel experience I have encountered and I absolutely refuse to ever fly Spirit again. I honestly don't know how they stay in business.",-1

We booked a roundtrip from BWI to FLL on Dec 29, 2018 and paid $516.69. My wife's medical issue required us to return home early. I tried to change our return flight for either Feb 18, 19 , 20, 21 but could not find any flights available. So I cancelled our return flight online, first cancelling mine successfully and then my wife's while being told she would incur a $29 fee. I then found that Spirit had seats available on ALL those dates and booked a flight on Feb 20 for $380.56. I asked a credit for the return flight we tried to change but were unable to. After several emails, I finally got this response: Please be advised that customers who initiate a CANCELLATION after 24 hours of booking to their non-refundable reservations will not receive a refund but rather a cancellation charge of $90.00 online or $100 over the phone plus a Passenger Usage Fee of $19.99 for each passenger, per way will be deducted from the total cost of your reservation and a Future Travel Credit (FTC) will be created for the remainder, if applicable, whereas a customer who initiates a MODIFICATION after 24 hours of booking to their non-refundable reservations will be billed with a modification charge of $90 online or $100 over the phone plus any FARE DIFFERENCE. We sincerely appreciate the time that you've taken to send along your documentation. As a one-time courtesy, we have issued you a Future Travel Credit for your missed flight segments. This FTC (future travel credit) can be used to book any future flight available in our system. Your credit is non-transferable and only the passengers linked to this reservation can redeem this credit. This credit is only valid for 60 days and once it does expire, it cannot be reinstated. You can redeem this credit online at www.spirit.com or, you can call our Reservations Center at 801.401.2222. So, the bottom line is that we paid $900 for a round trip and they were only willing to give us a CREDIT of $10 for a FUTURE flight. I will never fly with Spirit again, nor should you!",-1

This is by far the worst experience I have ever had flying. I waited in the security line for the normal 90 minutes and apparently the bar code did not show on my boarding pass email. I had to leave the line go back to the airport entrance and get a printed pass. Only to have to wait in line again. With my few remaining minutes I calmed down and regrouped. They called the standard 1-4 groups and as can be expected at this point I was in the last group. When I got to the door I was told my daughters bag was 3 inches too big and I would need to pay an additional 48.00!  I chose this flight because it was $10 cheaper than the Alaska air option. Lesson learned.  The folks at the terminal were just awful, lacking any personality whatsoever.",-1

My boyfriend and I booked a trip to Mexico with a group of our friends this past weekend. Today, I went to check into my flight back home to realize they changed one of my flights from tonight to tomorrow morning. I talked to five people before I could even get a standby flight to still get home around 3am instead of 1am (beats 9am like the flight they picked out for me). The first person I talked to told me he could check me out of my flight and put me on the original one but wanted to charge me FOR THE FLIGHT I WAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE ON. And then I had to check my bag AGAIN and go in and out of security for a second time just to talk to a human about this mess up of theirs. But the main reason I was so upset was because I never received a text, email, etc.. How can they delay my departure and not even let me know? Anyways, the rest of my group only got delayed about 30min-1hour and they got an email letting them know. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline so I will never be flying Spirit again. My longest travel day of 12 hours now turned into a 21 hour day of dealing with people who don’t care at all about their jobs. There was another group in line in front of me asking if someone could get them a hotel and the spirit manager said “i can’t control the weather so you having to getta hotel isn’t my problem”.",-1

My partner and I recently had the worst flying experience we've ever had - thanks to Spirit. Our flight to Florida from Niagara Falls was cancelled due to bad weather (fair, this happens to any airline) - we had to book another flight - from another airline - in another city. However, we kept our return flight.. When waiting to return from Fort Lauderdale, our flight was cancelled with just 5 minutes before we were scheduled to board (that's 2 for 2) - the reason being, the ""flight flight crew didn't how up"" (the man actually announced this to us)... We then had to wait in line for 4 hours to speak to a ticket agent (who booked us on another airline, the following day) we had to book our own hotel, and we haven't been accommodated for this.. I could not imagine flying this airline with a family who had small children (many did) it was 3:30a.m. before we got to a hotel room - I will never fly this airline again, and I will tell all to avoid.. spend the extra couple hundred bucks on a reputable airline, who actually have back-up flight crew available. I cannot believe how irresponsible this airline is, and how they're still able to operate..",-1
2019-03-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never flying Spirit Airlines again,False,"  On March 2nd my family flew from Orlando to Baltimore. Once we landed at BWI, we were met with multiple reasons why our flight was delayed. At first it was weather, then it was maintenance with chuckles from the two counter people from the microphone.. Along us sat multiple families that we're going to miss the last bus to home, no sympathy from any staff concerning anyone traveling even though it was a mechanical issue. I went to the counter to inquire if flight was even going to fly and the counter attendants would not tell me, after 12 hours of travel I did not want to wait to find out.. The next question asked was if a refund for this half of trip could be had and baggage gotten as they also wanted volunteers to give up seats for over booked flight, they stated yes go to ticket counter. Once down at the counter they gave an excuse that they could not refund from where they were as they had no way to figure out money coming back due to some of the ticket being used. A number for customer service was given and we were told to call for the refund to be processed. The following morning a call was made and after speaking to multiple people we were told that we could not have our refund as we were ""no shows"" to the flight, then it was we called to late to get the refund and finally it was we could not get the refund due to plane taking off multiple hours after scheduled time. Here is to never flying with Spirit Airlines again. At the end of the day it is worth paying a little extra to fly with an airline that stands behind their product and customers.",-1

",True," Standard baggage weight limit is only 40 pounds, vs 50 pounds for almost every other airline Not even water is free onboard. The seats are hard plastic shells with minimal padding. After the first of three hours I was already uncomfortable and in pain. The seats don't recline and the rows are very, very close together. The tray tables are only about 5 inches deep (half a normal tray). The app allowed me to upgrade my seats to the 'big' seats (made for humans) but when I got to the airport they told me the those had been sold out for a long time. Their app lied to me. If you're traveling with a companion you must pay to make sure you'll be sitting with them. Frankly, their whole pitch about being a low cost airline is untrue for anyone traveling with friends or family and who wants to at least have a comfortable seat. No music. No movies. No in flight status. No wifi. Basically, a flying school bus. By the time you get done with all the extra fees and limitations they really aren't much cheaper than a decent airline. It left me feeling as if I'd been conned. I'll never fly them again.",-1

Checked the bags online and u still had to go to a kiosk and print the ticket for the bag wait in line for an hour for someone to take the bag. The person at the check in counter was rude and told us to hurry up we had plenty of time.Because of the crazy long wait In the bag line we missed our flight.

2019-03-01,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Las Vegas,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,definitely fly again!,True,"  We booked our flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for 2 adults, 2 children and an infant for under $320 roundtrip! We booked prior to reading all the bad reviews about Spirit Airlines. Once we started to read we instantly became so worried. However there was no way of canceling because of the $100 cancellation charges for each person -so we took our chances. Spirit airlines allows you to check-in your kids car seats and a stroller at no cost which is so awesome given their check-in baggage costs anywhere from $35(in advanced online purchase) to about $60 (at the airport). We each took a backpack (18x12x4) and a diaper bag on with us at no additional charge. We did not choose to buy specific seating however they were able to accommodate our family to sit together at no cost. Once at the gate we were given priority advanced seating because we were traveling with children. The seats vary, if you want to have a bigger seat and more leg space then you can pay for it (just like almost all airlines have a business class). The seats in economy were ok, they aren't the greatest but it's worth the price! The staff on board was so kind! They even entertained my kids! Flight attendants Becky and Minon were so amazing! Thanks Spirit, we'll definitely fly again! Tip: double check your dates when booking, read and follow all their guidelines and you will be fine. Also dont believe what you read online.",1

2019-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Newark,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3.0,made this trip the most horrible,True,"  Las Vegas to Newark. Little did I know Spirit will ruin my anniversary trip. Avoid this at any cost, stranded at the airport for 60 Hours due to this. For $50-100, don’t ruin your trip. I have traveled 3-4 times with spirit and It was going very well for me. All previous flights were on time and I was reaching the destination on time. But little did I know this horrible experience is stored for me. My LAS-EWR flight NK 760 was on 10:45 PM PST (20-Feb-19). We checked in and did security check-in well before time and sit at Gate 25. Suddenly there was so much noise and everybody was rushing. What happened? got to know few spirit flight got canceled. They were giving different reasons to diff passengers. I was scared and praying to god, don’t cancel our flight. Did he listen to my prayer? cause Spirit said, due to weather, they are delaying the flight by 12 hours? It was hardly any snow in Vegas, come-on, we belong to the east coast, this was nothing. And for a 1/4th inch of snow, the flight should be equipped and prepared but no. Still, better then cancelation. Our checked in bag was on carousel #10. We collected our bag and found a spot for 2-3 hours’ sleep. I woke up 3 in the night ( who gets sound sleep on the airport), was checking social media and checked my email. Bang, there was cancelation notification of my flight. We ran to the Spirit counter and asked why they did not send a message. Who checks email? They were least bothered about the cancellation and in plain tone “ sir wither take a refund or next available seat is on 2 days later flight”. Next day rebooking was all full. I made a scene, shouted on them. We said we both will miss our work. After 30-40 Minutes, Lady names ‘Love’ came to us and handover the boarding pass for the next day (21-Feb) same flight. The sense of relief, even we were late, we got the seats in the next available flight. We asked whether you guys will provide hotel accommodation or Meal Voucher? They said “No, it's not their policy to provide these” We somehow managed the next 20 hours. In these 20 hours, we got to know, southwest canceled their 90% flight operating from Vegas and Spirit canceled 80% flight. And the reason was not clear to anyone. No news on social media, nothing. Again same process, check-in, security and we were at gate-25 at 8 PM PST. This time we saw spirit flight were flying. Glad they were operating. Our boarding had started, we were in the queue, they scanned boarding pass and when we were about to enter the plane, their employee came running to us, said “we need to de-board the flight. The window has been frozen and the crew will clean that”. Half of the passengers had already settled in the plane. No problem, we came out in the sitting area and there was so much speculation of what’s going on. But no, God had some other plan. I saw pilots were coming out of the plane a few moments later and he said, they don’t have deicer and plane will not fly. And at their counter, spirit assistants saying, its just 30-40 Minutes delay. After 30 minutes, they canceled it.  We ran to their main counter. It was all chaos. 2 hours in the line. This fiasco made this trip the most horrible one of our life. We were emotionally and physically distressed, all thanks to Spirit. It was a mental trauma going through all these in such cold weather. I don’t think we will ever travel via spirit.",-1
2019-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,avoid them like the plague,True," My wife and I were scheduled to take flight 612 at 1.15 am from Las Vegas to Minneapolis on Monday, Feb 25th. Spirit cancelled our flight due to what we later learned was ""staffing problems"". We arrived at the airport at 11.15 pm, but there was a long line due to the cancellation. As we waited for an agent, we started overhearing them telling the other travelers that they would need to be put in a hotel and take another flight Tuesday morning at 1.15 am. My wife and I run a set of in-home day cares with 20+ kids and we also have two young children (1 and 4) who were being babysat by their grandma who also needed to work that morning. If we stayed in a hotel that night, we would have needed to close the day cares, forcing all the parents of our kids to stay home and us losing out the income for that day ($1000 worth), not to mention forcing my mother to miss out on her work and babysit the kids another day. Staying in a hotel was not an option for us. As the time dwindled down and the Spirit line moving at a snail's pace, I knew I had to do something, so I quickly checked any other flights leaving soon to MSP and found a 12.35 am Delta flight. It was 11.45 pm, so I ran over to the Delta kiosk and they said I had 4 minutes to book this flight. It cost us $1,516.00 to book a one-way flight for the both of us, but having no other option we had to book the tickets. We arrived at the gate with minutes left available to board. After talking to some other passengers, we learned that they had also come from the cancelled Spirit flight, but the Spirit's agents had paid for their entire Delta airfare. Later that day, I called Spirit's customer service line and spoke with two different reps who offered to refund the cost of the return flight for $315, considerably less than the $1,516 I paid for Delta. I tried to explain to them that Spirit bought and paid for the other traveler's tickets so why do I need to get stuck with Delta's bill over their cancellation, but the reps stuck to their script. I then drove to the airport to speak to someone face to face. The Spirit agents at MSP said that it was ""my decision"" to purchase the Delta tickets and that I should have waited for Agent Assist. Waiting in line was not an option, we bought the Delta tickets with 4 minutes left available to do so. If we would have waited in line, we would have missed the flight. Again, the Spirit agents eventually stuck to their script and refused to refund me the cost of the Delta tickets, all due to their crew not showing up causing the cancellation. If we had stayed in a hotel that morning and a parent of our day care had no other choice but to pay 7 times the price of our day care, we would have reimbursed them for their trouble because that is the right thing to do, regardless of what our policies or the law or regulations say, if you cancel a flight then you owe it to your customers to do everything possible to make it up to them. This very important value is what Spirit lacks, and that is why they have now forever lost my wife's and my business. I am out $1,200 dollars and it is Spirit's fault, but they refuse to take responsibility. Perhaps if they would have done so we would have continued to fly Spirit, but not anymore and from this day on if anyone wants to book Spirit I will tell them to avoid them like the plague. Lesson is, if you are thinking of booking Spirit to save money, you'll end up paying in the long run, like I did.",-1

I read the fine print (what is covered and, more importantly, what was *not such as reclining seats and snacks). I arrived early to verify luggage weights & sizes including the personal item. I paid the extra few dollars to board in Zone 2. What made it a great experience was the skill of the pilot & co-pilots we flew through one of the worst windstorms in recent memory and the landing was one of the best landings I've experienced in 40 years.

Response was crew was ill. I arrived early but almost missed flight because another email was sent moving flight back to 5:09. Flight was boarded but delayed because pilot was still running late. Arrived just after 7am and crew and pilot announced that flights were being held that were the connecting flights. We ran to gate E8 and when we arrived at 7:20am they were just closing the door and wouldn't allow us to board even though the crew said they would wait. The desk attendant told us she could get us on a flight out of Orlando and that if we didn't run to gate G8 we would miss that one too. We ran back to gate G8 and they were still missing but said we weren't on the manifest. We were told to go to customer service to be added. We did so and they said corporate already moved us out on a 4:35 flight. We were told that if we wanted something sooner we needed to exit the terminal and go to the ticket desk. I spoke with an agent and she said there was nothing she could do, that this was the soonest flight available. I explained to her all the issues with her staff and the lies that were laid upon us. In all my years of flying I have never experienced such chaos. This is unacceptable management. There was no reason that the gate door couldn't have been opened to let us last 6 passengers on board unless your airline overbooked it. Not only are we now 10 hrs behind schedule now but the arrangements that have to be made are expensive and time consuming. I believe that your customer service is in need of some serious modifications and that our 4 tickets should be comped due to your staffs inability to provide the customer service we deserved.",-1

I am a senior citizen with a fix income and really can afford to lose the hundred but said fine. But I was told by their customer service rep that I was only getting back $15.60 from a $219 fare. Why? If I am losing $100 than I should get back $119. I was also told by their customer rep that if I change the date I would have to pay an additional $215. This is so unfair.,-1

Started offf by my flight being cancelled due to a cracked windshield. They told us that a new plane would be available at 2:30am. That never happened. They then allowed me to fly a different airline which was American Airlines which I highly recommend. When I went to fly home they informed me that my return flight was cancelled due to the fact that I never got on my cancelled flight. Unfortunately they had no flights for 2 days so I had to pay 500 for one way home on a different airline and they said they couldn’t help me.,-1

Terrible customer service both on the plane and via phone. The seats are extremely hard, too close together, no elbow room, no leg room and watch your head standing up. The staff won't offer you anything to eat or drink, but they will be rude to you. I'll never fly with this airline again.",-1

The flight was late leaving Ft Lauderdale. When we arrived in Atlanta we were forced to get off the plane. We went to use the restroom get food. When we got back the gate was closed and we couldn't get on the plane. Keep in mind it was the same plane through to LA. As we are standing there their manager is cheering great job on turning the plane. We are stranded in Atlanta for 24 hours. Worst customer service! No empathy the staff in Atlanta are savages.,-1
2019-02-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Akron,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,horrible customer service,False,"  I had a flight going out of Tampa, FL at 4:12pm and flying into Akron-Canton, OH Spirit updated their app and it was delayed about an hour. Not long after that it got delayed 3 other times for a final time of 9:06pm as the departure time. Around 5:30pm I checked the app for an update and there was a red box saying cancelled. Spirit airlines didn’t even send out an email alerting me of the cancellation nor did they try to call and contact me. If I wouldn’t have been constantly checking the app, I wouldn’t have known about the cancellation. When I called to get a new flight and change the airport I was flying into because i has somebody to pick me up there, Spirit wanted me to pay a “fair transfer fee”. What? You cancel my flight and don’t alert me which is an inconvenience to me and I miss an important doctors appointment because of it and now you want me to pay for your negligence when I’m just trying to get home? I don’t think so. On top of all this, calling your customer service line is garbage and might be more frustrating. To anybody reading this, Do not, do not ever book a flight with Spirit airlines even if your life depended on it. Oh yeah and I got a $50 voucher to use before the end of April for the delay because that fixes everything. Garbage airline, nickel and dime you for everything and horrible customer service.",-1

My new husband and I are on our honeymoon but have spent the last two days in the airport. The first delay overnight was due to weather but the second delay was due to the crew not showing up for the flight on time. The crew was over an hour late. As I sit here we are still unsure if we will leave today, or have money for new tickets or a hotel. We can not leave or take a car because we are without our checked baggage. This is my honeymoon. I hope you will try to win back my patronage but due to the service I have received, I doubt to receive even adequate service, let alone, flight. I will always remember this and let friends and family know how terrible this",-1

Several years back I used this airline and it was horrible. Silly me trying to give them the benefit of the doubt thought they deserved a second chance. Not only is the customer service horrible but the baggage policy listed on the website does not match the information given at the door. My carry on measured 17”, according to the website it must be below 22” for no charge. As I boarded a rude representative said that I would have to pay a $65 fee. I explained that my bag fit the description as advertised on the website. I even went ahead and placed my bag in the carry on box to show her. Her precise words were “your bag fits the box therefore you’ll have to pay the fee” to sum up her reasoning if your bag is under the the size limit you’ll have to pay, if it is over the size limit you’ll have to pay. There is no such thing as a free carryon item with Spirit. Either way you’ll have to pay. Whatever just add on an extra $130 on top of your ticket price. If I can give this review no stars I would.",-1

My flight was cancelled 2/7/19, Thursday evening, due to snow. Spirit's idea on getting another flight out was possibly on Saturday they would be able to get me to Las Vegas. I ended up flying out Thursday night with Delta but it cost an additional $400 for a last minute flight. I came back Sunday morning, 2/10/19 and my flight out of Las Vegas was delayed due to the plane coming in. So I missed my connection and the best they could do was to possibly get me home on Monday or Tuesday. I ended up getting an airfare with Sun Country, which cost me $400. It cost me over $800 extra for Spirits poor service and airfare and all they will do is credit me back the cost of Spirits airfare. Note to self-book with any other airline other than Spirit and pay extra $100 up front and know you will get to your destination on time and have a customer service team that cares. Do not fly Spirit - big rip off.",-1

I was traveling to Atlanta. The flight was delayed 3 hours with no explanation given. My return flight was delayed 6 hours. 1.5 of those 6 hours was spent sitting on the plane waiting for the pilots to arrive at the airport. Last summer I flew from Orlando. Ended up sitting next to a passenger that insisted on bullying the person in front of us leading to a huge altercation on the plane. My third experience (I should’ve known better by now, right?), my 10:58pm flight was delayed 3 hours for no reason. I left at 1:30am. My final run-in with Spirit happened yesterday when I rushed to the airport just to get to the gate and find out my flight was delayed 4 hours. 4 hours then turned into 6 hours. “Mechanical issues. Here’s a $7 food voucher!” Needless to say, I cancelled my flight and drove back to my condo and will never give them a penny ever again. It’s not worth it. The cabin is cramped. No WiFi. The planes are always having issues. The luggage costs you your first born child and a limb. Just book with a reputable airline. Save yourself the despair.",-1

I don't mind the horrid seats, awful snacks and shoddy service but what really annoys me is their website and App which fails 99% of the time to successfully check me in via mobile or email methods. To be printing boarding passes in this day and age is a joke and something you only see in the USA. They should be fined for this level of service there's no excuse for it and most other airlines have figured it out.",-1
2019-02-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. Maarten to Dallas via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,"ineptness and lack of empathy""
",True,"  Complete ineptness and lack of empathy for their customers. On our return trip from St. Maarten to Dallas, our initial flight out was delayed 3 hours, to which we missed our connection in Fort Lauderdale. We were told in St. Maarten that we would be on the first direct flight the following morning in Fort Lauderdale to Dallas but learned different upon arrival. Spirit Airlines “fix” to get us to DFW was four connections: St. Maarten to Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale to Orlando, Orlando to Atlanta, Atlanta to Detroit, then Detroit to Dallas, traveling over two days. My wife and I were left to sleep in the terminal in Orlando, as we arrived past 11pm with every hotel booked solid on a Saturday night, with no offer from Spirit to put us up somewhere or vouchers for food. If it wasn’t for an employee in Orlando who managed to rebook us through one hub instead of two, and get us on stand-by for a direct flight to Dallas at 12:02am Saturday, my wife and I would of arrived at 12:43am om Sunday. We tried to get help rebooking in St. Maarten and Fort Lauderdale before arriving in Orlando, and employees at both locations made no effort to assist us. Flying cheap will save you a couple of bucks, but in the long run, only one employee at Spirit cared that we were more than seat fillers.",-1
2019-02-19,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Tampa,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,experience was fantastic,True,  I originally had American Airlines from Tampa to Philadelphia to State College and then a return flight. Plans change and I didn't need the flight to State College but American Airlines was going to charge me over $450 to drop that off the ticket. I got a $69 ticket one way from Philadelphia to Tampa and it could not have been a better experience. From checking my bag to the crew on the plane to the overall experience it was fantastic. Even the Spirit Airlines employee when we were picking up our luggage in Tampa was very helpful and pleasant. I will definitely be using Spirit Airlines whenever I can as long as these experiences continue.,1
2019-02-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never again on Spirit,False,  New Orleans to Los Angeles. Never again would I fly on Spirit. They charged me $65 because the plastic handle on my tiny bag stuck out less than a half an inch past the extremely tiny slot. There was almost nothing in my bag and it fit perfectly. Other passengers bags were clearly packed full and really heavy. So it’s not the weight like they claim it’s just them trying to rip people off and ruin trips. They wouldn’t even give you a free cup of ice. I had to pay for it. Seats feel like concrete and the staff is rude.,-1
2019-02-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,airline is a rip off,True," This has by far been the worst airline experience I have ever witness in my 18 years of traveling. The lines were extremely long, the desks were understaffed, the staff was unpleasant, and it was complete chaos. I flew out of Orlando to Boston on a 7:00 am flight and the bag drop line took triple the amount of time it should have. Spirit’s bag weight limit is also 10 lbs under the average and you have to pay if it’s over 40 (whereas most others have a 50 lb limit). It’s such a scam for money and not worth a penny. We nearly missed our flight due to the horrible disorganization. Save your money, this airline is a rip off - if I could rate zero stars I would.",-1

Not only are the costs necessary to book this flight, but Spirit does not intend to complete any of their booked flights. Today, we attempt to fly into Chicago. Yes, it is snowing there. The other airlines are actually traveling. Flight planned for 3:40. Then moved to 9:50pm. Then moved to 7:57pm. Right now it’s claiming 10:07 departure. Not holding my breath. I’m on the way to the rental counter to get a car and drive to Atlanta.",-1
2019-02-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Denver,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit is truly awful,False,  Flew Detroit to Denver. I know everyone probably says this but Spirit is truly awful. I really do not know how anyone could fly this terrifying airline. I was dumb enough to think I was saving money. If you sneeze it’s 5$. Then when it takes you 13 hours to get to your destination you have to wait over an hour just to get your bags. All because Spirit doesn’t want to pay for a baggage team so they have to use other airlines. It’s literally mind boggling how they are still in business. And their only compensation is to give you money toward Spirit miles. Never ever will I even think of buying a ticket on this airline again.,-1
2019-02-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Incompetency pops in my mind,True,"  Baltimore to Detroit. Today I had a 7:35pm flight flying out of BWI arriving in DTW at 9:15pm I arrived at the gate and the monitors assured me that the arriving location was indeed Detroit, MI, when it was my turn to board I gave the gate agent my ticket she scanned the ticket and I boarded the plane. When we landed to my surprise the pilot mentioned that we were in Boston. I was very confused but just thought this might have been the last flight of the day and the pilot was tired and just made a mistake. To my surprise when we deboarded the plane we were indeed in Boston, not Detroit. I am confused how I was able to have my ticket scanned and board a plane to a location that was not my destination? At spirit Airlines can you just purchase a ticket and board any plane as long as it’s a spirit airplane? To make matters worse when I deboarded the plane and tried to figure out how and why I was in Boston when I was supposed to be in Detroit, again my ticket was scanned before boarding the plane, the Boston agents then told me that the gate must have changed and they did not update the monitor? How would a person flying know that the gate was changed if on the monitor it says arriving in Detroit? Again unacceptable? And what’s really mind boggling is how can a person have their tix scanned and allowed to board the wrong plane?!? To “accommodate” me Spirit airline booked me another flight the next day, unfortunately that didn’t do much considering that I had a very very important meeting to attend tomorrow morning at 7am and will not arrive in Detroit until after 8am, causing me to miss out on a very important meeting and big contract! I am livid because of the incompetence at spirit airlines it has cost me thousands of dollars for my start up company! On top of that they provided me with $35.00 worth of food vouchers which was useless because all of the restaurants were closed except for Dunkin’ Donuts, so at this point I am livid and hungry and you all offer is $35 worth of, end of the night, donuts? Unacceptable. To make matters worse the hotel voucher they gave me to the Towne Place Suites Boston, for the night was completely sold out so to my surprise when I arrived at the Towne Place Suite, hungry, tired, extremely irritated, and sad because of me not being able to attend my 7am meeting I was told that they could not accommodate me because they were completely sold out for the night, but wait it gets better, the hotel did have one room available however another guest was given that room also. The room they were placed in slept 4 people (2 Queen Size Beds) and a roll away bed was available if they needed but they wanted 2 rooms so each child could have their own bed. So instead of politely telling them sorry we can’t accommodate you with another room, however we can provide a roll out bed so that everyone can still be happy and accommodated. The operations manager told me that I could not be accommodated because she was giving them the only room that was available so the family was able to get 2 rooms to accommodate the fact that each child wanted their own bed, talk about privileged! Again unacceptable! Why would spirit airline employees give me a voucher for a hotel that was fully committed? Incompetency pops in my mind again! So now I had to find another place to lodge.",-1
2019-02-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Pittsburgh via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,$65 extra dollars for skateboard,True,"  Oakland to Pittsburgh via Las Vegas. Me and my boyfriend went on vacations from Florida to California and we got a connection flight in Las Vegas. When we were coming back our flight got delayed 5 times and they had to change our connection flight. The solution was send us to Las Vegas then to Pittsburgh and then home (Orlando). When we got to Las Vegas, waiting for our next flight we saw 4 different situations about complaints and bad customer service. The staff in general in that airport is really bad. I never saw anything like that with any airline. After they “handle” the situation with the customer they start talking behind their backs. That’s so unprofessional. It’s like one of the requirements to work for this airline it’s have the worst attitude ever starting with the “supervisor”. We had the same problem twice in the same airport with the same people. We travel all our flights with no problems till we got to that airport. They charge us for $65 extra dollars for my boyfriend’s skateboard and they didn’t let us take it with us into the plane with the promise that we’ll receive the skate at our destination. Guess what?! We never did. The skateboard got stuck at Pittsburgh. Before my boyfriend give them the skateboard he asked many times cause this happened before and they were really rude at him and they didn’t ever heard his concerns or questions. They don’t care at ALL. Not about our money, not about our experience with the airline, not about our questions or concerns. I used to travel with Spirit anywhere but with this experience I’m done. Definitely me and my family aren’t travel in this airline no more. Recommendations: Give your people better training. Specially that group from Las Vegas!",-1

Bucket seats with no padding and horrible customer service. Offered us little options or compensation when they flew us into Chicago and told us we would be stranded there for at least 24 hours. However, the next flight was also out in the evening and would likely be cancelled as well. If they had informed us before we boarded our first flight, we could have stayed happily in Denver. Instead, we had to pay hundreds of dollars to get home from Chicago, and then Spirit only offered to refund us their supposed cost of the second leg of the flight, a quarter of what we paid. I was skeptical when my partner scheduled us flying with them and I will never fly Spirit again after this horrific experience.",-1

If you have regular carry on luggage, which is has no problem with any other airlines to take on board, Spirit airlines will charge you for this bag $65. You allowed to have a little purse and little bigger than purse second bag. My girlfriend has to pay $65 for her carry on even it did feet required parameters, only because bag wheels were barely seen outside. Flight staff is very unfriendly irritable and unprofessional. Poor customer service. Airline seats are very uncomfortable and they charge even for water! Sometimes pay cheaper tickets cost you more at the end its exactly about Spirit airlines. If i could rate zero star i would for such a poor and unprofessional customers service.",-1
2019-02-11,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cali,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,Great value for the money,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Cali. We are senior Canadians who have travelled a lot internationally so do have some experience with airlines. We found this airline especially good in terms of comfort, smoothness, adherence to schedule and attentiveness of staff. The price was very, very reasonable. In fact we have flown this four hour route probably 10 times now over the years and have never found such a deal. It left precisely on time and we arrived 15 minutes early. The plane itself was very new, very clean and not overcrowded. As mentioned in flight information, no meal was served but anticipating this in advance we were able to bring sufficient carry on food to meet our needs. The luggage taken was minimal, which most seasoned travellers do, so there was no extra charge. The ride itself was very pleasant and without much turbulence. Our take-off and landing were both excellent and we cannot say enough about the courtesy of the staff. They were attentive and very cheerful and this was late in the night. We did request a beverage along the way and it was very reasonably priced. After booking this flight, we did look at reviews and were somewhat apprehensive due to the negativity. Upon closer examination we noted that many were made by individuals who were travelling within the United States itself. It seemed that perhaps many had unrealistic expectations and/or had not travelled that much internationally so had little basis of comparison. We would certainly fly with Spirit Airlines again. Great value for the money.",1
2019-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston Logan to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,had the worst experience,True,"  Boston Logan to Orlando in March 2018. My boyfriend and I had the worst experience with Spirit Airlines. Our flight was delayed 12 hours then canceled. Spirit kept our whole flight in the airport due to mechanical issues. Every hour on the hour they claimed that the plane was almost ready. In fact at 8pm we watched all the service members stop work and leave but the airline was still insisting that someone was working the problem. The truth is, they were delaying as long as possible so that people would cancel their flights themselves and Spirit wouldn't have to accommodate. My boyfriend and I stuck it out until midnight when their severely understaffed, unorganized, and rude customer service began accommodating the remainder of the passengers who did not cancel. When I called customer service I spent over two hours trying to reach them between dropped calls and redirects. I finally was able to speak to a supervisor around 1am and demanded a flight back the next day on a different airline. They have me a flight back the next day in the evening so I had to spend an extra day in Boston. They also promised a voucher for a future flight but neglected to tell me there was an expiration on the voucher. I called back to see if I could cash that voucher in for a flight and customer service stated that the voucher was expired and they couldn't reissue.  Overall, Spirit is not cheaper than the other airlines if you count your luggage additions in. Spirit customer service is sluggish, rude, and unethical. Their airplanes are small, tight, and dirty. I was willing to let them redeem themselves but after this debacle I will likely never fly with Spirit again.",-1

This is the worst flight and service I have ever been on. I’ve flown a lot and by far this is the worst. My flight got cancelled due to weather, and when I would go up to ask questions about the next available flight, the workers were rude and extremely inconsiderate. On top of that, the flight from LA to Las Vegas was horrible, the seats were uncomfortable, the flight attendants were rude and lazy. Not only that, but the flight itself was horrible. Plus, you have to pay 45$ for every carry on bag, per person. Don’t use the airline, they claim to be the cheap and efficient way to travel, but it’s not. After the the extra expenses they charge it’s about the same as a flight on a good airline like Alaska.",-1

Took a short flight to Vegas for my husband’s birthday. The airline is upfront about the pricing and what is included. For the people that complain about the seats, you receive and email specifically about the seats. They don’t recline and they’re small, hence less repairs and more room for more travelers. TADA lower price. If I was taking a longer flight I may go with an airline with more frills. I had no issue with this airline. Check in was easy. Bag drop off was quick. Flight was shorter than estimated time. Staff was friendly. You sit real close to your seat mate, but there are much worse things in this world than rubbing elbows on a plane.",1

I am being told that we can only receive a credit for a future flight and we will be charged $100 each. We cannot afford to pay for flights we will not be taking plus $200.  They are taking my money and I will likely never use the tickets. The flights are not until the middle of April. This is a two month lead time to cancel. It is unacceptable that they will not refund our money. I have flown on Spirit before. They signed me up for something that allowed us to save. The following year they charged my card for dues.

Tampa to Hartford via Ft Lauderdale. I booked a flight within 6 days of the flight, tried to cancel the ticket within 12 hours for a refund or even a decent voucher. Couldn’t do either, 60 days is the voucher and a refund isn’t possible. They charge you a fee for a 135 dollars if you want to switch flight. Or if you go to the app and try to book another flight for cheaper they try to charge me an extra 120, for a flight that’s 150. I canceled my membership with them and I will never fly spirit again.",-1

This was my first time on a plane and all I can say is this will be my last time flying Spirit. I had to pay $65 for my small suitcase. I was told it was too big just by them looking at it, but after I paid I see everybody else walking up in line measuring their bags then getting on the plane. How can they know my bag is too big if no one said I could measure it. On the way back home I measured my bag. It fit, but I was charged $55 at that point. They said my bag won’t fit under my seat. But it fit in the measurement. Im confused on the policy and I feel like my money was too for no reason. Not only that, an empty felt like it was ok to walk up in my face just to repeat the same thing another employee was already telling me. When she couldn’t get her point across, she yelled out for them to cancel my flight. They didn’t, but I’m sure employees don’t supposed to walk up in customers faces just to get their point across. I’m not obligated to listen to you repeat what I already heard.",-1

I was charged $65 for a carry on, without asking me if my carry on fits their size threshold. At the counter the staff did not even put my carry on in the basket to see if it fits. She saw I have a carry on and she said $65. It did not sound right at all. When I arrived at my destination, I approached the counter asking what happened, the lady took my carry on and placed in in the size basket and it fit right in. She said ""why were you charged"" I said I do not know. I was given a number to call. My trip was for only 24 hours stay in Vegas for a funeral. The next day when I arrived back to Oakland CA. I approached the same staff at the counter asking why was I charged with out fitting my carry on, She said ""sorry sir, we were too busy and hectic"". She asked me to speak to her supervisor at downstair departure main counters. I spoke with the supervisor, he fit my beg saw it was fitting. He said to allow him to speak to the employee in the back door inside their office. He came back saying the employee said I had a different bag the day before. I told him that she at her counter just told me she was sorry and she was hectic and mistakenly charged me, and now that I am not before her she says I had a different bag?  The manager told me to email customer support to recover the charge. Which I will, and I told him if this to lie to me again, and just to brush me off I will come back to his counter. After emailing back and forth and sending the pictures of my bag inside the carry on fit basket, they said the handle of my beg was slightly higher than the line.  They refused to reimburse the charge. I felt completely ripped off.  I will never fly Spirit again.",-1

We (my wife, my son, and I) were flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Denver, Colorado yesterday, 1/27/19 on a Spirit flight and I would say this was the type of flight that gives one a fear of flying. We sat on the plane prior to take off for 2 hours and the FA waited until my wife finally reached the restroom after sitting for hours without substantial update and cut her off to wash her hands offering not even a side glance in for explanation. She appeared to have reached the point in ones job where they dislike others in an indiscriminate way a decade ago at least. She glared at people angrily over her magazine for taking emergency calls during this 2 hours and dug her nails into her chair when the plane shook violently for most of the flight while my wife gripped my hand worriedly and the woman across the isle visibly appeared to pray under her breathe. She offered no service or comfort at all. The other attendants remained mostly in the front refilling beverages. I’ve never felt so wantonly disregarded on a flight.",-1

Absolutely the lowest level of care and customer service with this airline. They just want to charge you big fees on everything after they lure you in with a low fare. No help to a first time customer who made a time mistake but didn't catch it until after the 24 hour window (spam folder). Flight 2 months away and still wouldn't budge to help a family of 4 do a simple switch to the AM version. I will now never again book to fly with this horrible company.,-1

Arrived 50 minutes before my domestic flight departed and tried to check in at the check in counter. I was told I was too late, that I missed my flight. After 40 minutes of arguing with them that my flight didnt leave for 50 minutes, and that I could checkin up up to 30 minutes prior to my flight leaving, they told me too bad I missed it. I had to be rescheduled for the middle of the day on Monday. All they said was that I should be lucky I got a new flight. Will never fly with Spirit again.

I was placed on a connecting flight to Orlando after being told no seats were available on the direct flight at 7 am the next day. However, when I got to my gate the next morning for the connecting flight, I decided to speak to staff and she was very knowledgeable and got me right on the flight direct to Chicago, granted it was delayed as well, i appreciated her being so helpful.

If you are flying internationally like we did think twice. They charge for everything. I saw some people being charged for a small bookbag!, There is no personal luggage that is free except your purse or small laptop bag. Don't take extra. Luggage is only 40 Lbs where in all other airlines you get free personal luggage plus purse/bag not to mention suitcase are only $25 while spirit charges online $45 I paid at the airport ""carry on"" which i thought was free $55 plus my $45 rip off! then I have to pay when I came back. So be prepared to 1) pay for each suitcase $45-$55 each (65 at the gate) 2) cannot exceed 40lbs or be prepared to pay. Uncomfortable small plain, they won't even give you ice, nothing at all, Don't pay for extra leg space etc there is no such thing as first class we were on the 5th row. You pay for your suitcases to go and to come. If you want your seats pre-selected prior to flight, its extra money.",-1

On my return flight from BQN to Orlando from 11pm to 3am (including taxi time time and such) I feel asleep. It was night time. The F/A wakes me up rather rudely, told me not to lean on the chair, and folded up my tray table so I couldn't put my arms on it. I will never fly Spirit again, even if I have to pay the extra 39 dollars for another flight. I've never been treated so rudely, and I used to be a F/A.

I've flown Spirit a handful of times, and believe me they've always been below average. However this last trip was so terrible, we were all stuck in customs and missed connecting flights. Nobody helped to organize or make any effort to help connecting flights get through customs, and after missing my flight, they made me wait in several different lines, each person passing me to the next. Finally, nobody was able to help me, and ended up staying overnight in Ft Lauderdale without any type of compensation. Understanding this procedure is similar on other airlines, Spirit specifically seemed to make a point to treat me with as little care or concern as humanly possible. Absolute last time I'll fly with them, and will be actively encouraging others to fly with any other airline.",-1

They charge you for the water you consume on the plane, and the disgusting staff at the Gates! They are not Organized, for me they are the worst line that I have had to travel, cheap passages that end up being more expensive after all! I had to be in PR on the date set for work commitments and thanks to your staff and bad service does not ask to meet my schedule!

2019-01-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Dallas,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,isn't the real price,True," Los Angeles to Dallas. The worst customer service I've ever been privy to in my life, BY FAR. I purchased my tickets online at their website and selected one carry-on bag. I bought the tickets 4 weeks before my flight Departed and the cost for one carry-on was $35. I get to the airport and they tell me I haven't paid for a bag. Apparently I bought one for my return flight only but didn't select one for my departing flight. Now an hour before my flight leaves they want to charge me $65 to get my carry-on on the departing flight. Now I call customer service. I get someone on-line who just repeats the cost of a bag at this stage of the game over and over and over and over again. I mentioned I bought the tickets a month ago but none of it matters. I asked for a manager and the supervisor gets on the phone and has been trained to deal with it in the exact same way repeating over and over and over again the cost of the carry-on bag at this stage of the game. Disrespectful, a complete disregard for any kind of customer service, and now I've paid $100 for a carry-on when the same flight on American airlines is $110. I've now paid double that. I can't even see how this airline is in existence. Actually I know exactly how. The price comes up as the cheapest on all of the search sites but it isn't the real price, in fact it's about half the actual price. Once you pay for your seat and bags it's by far the most expensive, and don't even think about calling customer service. They can't and won't do anything to help you. I wish I could do something more but this airline unfortunately will continue to do well due to clever marketing.",-1

Like everyone else, the flight was dirt cheap: $60 round trip from NY to FL. What I did not bank on was all the extra fees for baggage and delays. While delays may happen, I found it ironic that my wife and I flew the same time on different days and at 6:30PM, and at 9:00AM we received notification that the flight is delayed by 3+hours! Oh, but they expect you to still be there at the regular time! After all is said and done, the $60 fare cost us $140 including luggage. For that price, I should have flown JetBlue that includes one luggae, free overhead bins and snacks.",-1
2019-01-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is definitely the worst,False,"  Seattle to Las Vegas . I have flown many airlines around the world and Spirit is definitely the worst. Bought my tickets through a package deal, then found out about their baggage fees after I had paid for the package. It was cheaper for my wife and I to share a checked bag than take two carry- ons. The only problem, they lost our bag on a 2 hour direct flight to Seattle. Got my bag back 2 days later with a tag on it saying they where SUPER DUPER SORRY. They say that you get what you pay for, but after all the fees, it is cheaper to fly any other airline. They are so cheap, the plane we where on from Seattle to Las Vegas had a tray table that was half the size of normal tray tables, instead of a seat pocket, there was just bungee cords. Never again",-1

Spirit gives the feeling that you are getting a really good price on a ticket. The fact of the matter is yes your trip ticket is cheaper than most airlines. But then you have to pay to sit in a poor seat. Plastic seat with only a vinyl cover for padding. Second you have to pay for every bag bigger than a purse. There is no in flight entertainment. There is like 6 or 8 seats at the front of the plane that have some padding but at a steep cost. After all is said and done, tickets are about the same as flying on Delta or American Airlines. Never again will I fly Spirit or any other airline without researching them to save money. It’s just not worth it.",-1

The staff at Atlantic city actually caused us to miss our flight. Our trip was ruined, our added expenses to reach our destination exceeded $200 and Spirit feels that they are going above and beyond by offering a $50 pp voucher to be used on a future flight. Well that's useless because my family will never trust Spirit to get us to our destination again!!",-1

They decided to cancel my business trip flight at 4 in the morning, leaving me to scramble for another flight, which as you all know, cost a pretty penny.

Do not fly them. Seats that don't recline. Like a rod in your back. They treat you with indifference (at best) or spite or malice. The price you're seeing is at least $55 lower than the price you'll pay since no bag is included. And, if the ticketing agent made a mistake, like they did with me, they'll charge you $55 again. And then they won't even consider refunding this.  The line at ""Customer Service"" was long and full of unhappy faces. You'll spend hours on the phone if you try to call. They ignore you at all costs. It's all about scamming you – taking you for every sent you're worth and giving you nothing in return.",-1

It is the first and last time I will fly Spirit Airlines. My friend recommended that I should try them as I was looking to fly to FLL to attend a wedding. As I am very organized and don’t like any surprises when traveling, I registered online for my flight. This is what you need to know when you are flying with Spirit. 1) You pay for carry on and checked bags. 2) Carry on cost more than checked bags. 3) You pay for selecting your seat online. 4) You pay more to check your bag at the counter than online. 5) If you paid online for carry on and they will not accept it, you will have to pay the counter fee which is higher. Make sure you are very familiar with Spirit Airlines luggage rules, carry on and checked bad size and weights, these are there to get you. I paid for checked bag and seats in advance and they changed my carry on to checked bag in which I ended up paying $960.74 for round trip between EWR and FLL. This gets better as they lost our luggage and delivered one the following morning and the other never showed up. It was my wife's bag and you women that read this review can only imagine what was there especially when you travel to attend a wedding. I filed a claim with Spirit by mail (there is no phone number to reach them unless they email you and then you have someone to communicate with). The best part is that they denied my claim on the basis that “their investigation online” found that one of the items I submitted was returned. I am very surprised that they did not give me any information on the receipt they are referring to and I can assure you that it was replaced with a more expensive item knowing my wife. Flying used to be fun, not any more with companies like Spirit on the market.",-1
2019-01-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Orlando via Baltimore,,,,,,,1.0,late to request a refund,True,"  Detroit to Orlando via Baltimore booked for March 2019. Customer service had a chance to make me a loyal patron. Instead, I'll never give them another cent. Booked a flight for a conference, and I found out I needed to cancel roughly 36 hours after booking. Spirit offers a refund within 24 hours. Keep in mind I am giving about 4 months of advance notice. I contacted with a detailed explanation, asking for a human to talk with and was met with 3 automated messages. I was even asked to write a review of customer service before getting any automated response-that's how slow they were in replying. When a ""real person"" finally responded, they were un-empathetic, and reworded what was already said in the automated emails. In sum, I have a ticket I will not use, and the ""best"" they can do is offer a $50 credit for another Spirit flight. I would have even appreciated a credit for the value of the ticket (without fees), but because I was a half-day late to request a refund for a flight 4 months away, all I get is unhelpful automated responses and a credit offer worth a fraction of my ticket price. I've had similar scenarios with Delta, and even other cheap airlines like Allegiant, and never had an issue with customer service working with me to reach a reasonable solution that acknowledges me as a valued customer. Spirit offers many flights that appeal to me to destinations I frequent, but thanks to their customer service, I'll be opting for a company that doesn't treat me like a piece of garbage.",-1

Atlantic City to Tampa return. Both flights were great. I had heard negative things about Spirit, so was very interested and keen to fly with them, to enable me to have my own experience and form my own opinion. The price and flights were much better than other options, so I decided to fly with Spirit. Everything turned out to be completely smooth in both directions. Boarding was very fast on both flights, and service was reasonable (with cheerful staff). I had no problem bringing my backpack on board, as a free carry on. I knew Spirit is an affordable budget airline and not to expect free food or drinks, but the prices for purchasing items were reasonable. My flights left and arrived ahead of time. Leg room was reasonable and I was comfortable, it was worth being on a budget flight and preferred what little discomforts there were? There were none, considering the excellent fares. The aircraft was clean neat and tidy and the air crew and ground staff were all in good Spirit, pleasant and friendly. Definitely a value for money flight. I received everything I wanted and expected, a pleasant flight without any issues or problems. Only concern was my carbon fibre suitcase received unwarranted minor scratches. Next time I will protect my luggage with an outer cover. I would definitely fly with them again.",1

That was by far the worst experience of my life. I get to the airport more than an hour before our flight. Their check-in machines don't work. I asked for help, but no one was interested. There was more than 4 women behind the counter, doing nothing but chatting and checking their phones. When we walked over to one of them, who was extremely unfriendly and impolite, after fussing around for half an hour, one time they said they can't find our ticket, then they can find records of us paying for the luggage, then the printer is not work to print the tags. We finally get our luggage checked in, still don't understand what the problem was except, their employees are lazy and incompetent. We finally get through security and we get to the gate about 14 minutes before our flight. there was four of us. The gate door was still open and the plane still there. The check-in person mumbles and states that we missed our flight and we can't get on another flight. Considering that this was a morning flight. Yet not flights today or the following day. How about our luggage,? it's probably on the plane she said. After begging and arguing with her for a while, I realized that was useless. I needed to get to Orlando, so I call United, god bless them, they get me on a direct flight from IAD. So we took a cab to Dulles airport and we get on a flight on united. the difference was day and night. I called the the customer service, a woman that barely speaks english answers from the Philippines, I could barely understand anything she said. She told me basically tough luck, she's sorry but there is nothing she can do and I lose 2000K for my two tickets. I think it's crazy to have such an airline operate in this country.",-1

Not clearly defined rules for passengers to follow on baggage sizes. The boxes for checking the baggages are not at the places where it is easy to measure the size. They charge whatever they want to charge for the bags without notice. On line on Google when you check for prices they says are 55$ on boarding they charge you $65. They do not accept cash so if you forgot your credit card you can miss the flight. That's plain horrible experience.,-1

I use Spirit for my company and purchase their travel insurance but beware they will do anything to not honor their policies. I had to cancel due to a death of a dear friend and they refuse to honor their 100% cancellation guarantee with the insurance they offered a joke of a $10 voucher but were happy to charge me the extra money.

I have had a number of issues with their very poor customer service. If you need to make any changes they will not credit your card - they will give you a useless voucher that you can never redeem.

The organization is very poor, for example you have to do all the check in yourself at the airport kiosk then after that you still have to wait in line for an employee to do the same thing you just did, waste of time! Then the flight was overbooked. They asked 3 people to move trips and then asked for 4 volunteers because they had 4 extra exit row seats which does not make any sense. Another thing that is very irritating is that I paid extra to have the exit row seat and at the airport they are just giving them away to volunteers for free! Spirit does not treat their customers well, no snack on flight and employees are incapable. Worst airline I’ve ever flown on.",-1
2019-01-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta via Atlanta,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,not much of a good deal,True,"  My luggage was lost in a 1 hr direct flight home from Orlando to Atlanta. I spent many hours completing paperwork and claims. I am told I will be compensated for a portion of my claims by a nice customer service person. Spirit sent me a voucher with these words ""We're really sorry about what happened on your recent trip. We care about your satisfaction and want to make this right. Please accept our apologies along with this voucher for future travel to any of our destinations."" Sounds nice, right? It turns out that Spirit's Voucher are not what they seem to be. For example a $100 voucher will only save me about $8 off a flight. After all is said and done Spirit is not a good option for anyone with luggage and overall not much of a good deal. I will return to using Delta as my primary service provider for airfare.",-1

I've traveled numerous times and Spirit Airlines is the worst airline. They head the list. They charge for everything, you have to pay for tea, water or coffee is repulsive. After all the money you spend on a airline , at least simple beverage should be complimentary to the travelers. I'm so disgusted of this airline. Your seats are uncomfortable, they do not recline, leg room, small, they charge if you are checked in by a clerk at the airport. They even charge $10 if they print your boarding pass. Unbelievable they are still in business. Their flight attendants are not pleasant, they seem like they dont even want to come to work. This was my first time flying with Spirit Airlines and it will definitely be my last. I tried to rate them zero out of 10 but it wouldn't let me.",-1
2019-01-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Dallas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,never fly with them,True," Las Vegas to Dallas. If I could give them negative points, I would. I have flown Spirit a couple of times just because of the price of the bare fare. However, every time I fly them, I get treated like trash. First of all, If you fly them, you have to pay for bags online or you will have to pay the ridiculous $60 fee per bag. Since they are a ULCC, you have to pay for drinks and snacks. The crew on my flight ( NK208 January 5,2019) treated me specifically, like trash for no reason while they were nice to other passengers.The ground staff at Las Vegas were friendly though. The seat was extremely dirty and had stains and scratches all over it. Which means that their cleaning crews don’t do there jobs correctly. The seat itself was uncomfortable and doesn’t not recline. When we landed at DFW, The ground staff told us the bag claim was E31 (as the F/A s said when we landed) but the monitor did not display that. The monitor at E32 did but the staff told us that it was at E31. After 20 minutes of waiting, We realized that they had 3 flights on the same belt (E32) when there were 4 others open. Then our bags showed up at E32, when they said it was E31. So 4 flight were on the same bag Belt. Overall, Spirit is the most trashy Airline in the U.S. and even if their base fare is “cheap”, after all the addons, it ends up being the same price as the legacy carries. Do yourself a favor and never fly with them.",-1

Worst experience of my life. I was traveling back from our trip to Dominican Republic January 5,2019. Our flight got delayed when we were already in the plane, so from 4:30a to 5:45a it moved and went back to the gate, supposedly because of fog but they had no copilot and thats why they had to go back. That took over one hour, once we arrived to Fort Lauderdale at 7am at we couldnt get off the plane for another hour and 45 minutes which made us lose our conecting flight. Had to wait in line for over 2 hours with a toddler in order to get my flight rescheduled and that was not till 9:35pm with another air line which we had to pay our luggage again because spirit didnt take care of that. One of the people i was traveling with didnt even get reserved for the flight after being told she was and had to rush back to Spirit to have them book before we missed that flight. Spirit said they would reimburse all our fees for luggage that we paid and never did, and the luggage fee they have is more than double to other airlines and only accept 40lbs. It was the worst experience of my life and we all ended up sick even my toddler and was uncomfortable the entire time and sleep deprived. Wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

Everything turned out to be completely smooth in both directions. Boarding was very fast on both flights, and service was reasonable (with cheerful staff). We had no problem bringing our backpacks on board as free carry ons. We knew not to expect free food or drinks, but the prices for purchasing items were reasonable. But flights left and arrived on time. Not a huge amount of leg room, but we felt that it was worth being a bit cramped to get the excellent fares. I would definitely fly with them again.",1

This airline practices the most unprofessional business tactics ever. Everything about its design is to rob you of your hard earned dollars. It basically bribes you with low priced tickets to only charge you astronomical fees for your baggage. They will get your bags on your flight but leave you behind by changing departure times multiple times and not inform you. Only to add insult to injury by not offering a credit/refund for their error and inconvenience.

So if you’re traveling to the airport, you had no idea when you should actually leave. We finally get on this plane and these people don’t even turn off the lights in the plane, so now you have these bright lights shining in your eyes while you’re trying to sleep on a flight that doesn’t leave till 1 a.m. Never again will I fly with this airline.",-1

In consequence many were left with nowhere to stay all thanks to a under trained (if trained at all), and heartless staff. The manager did nothing to ease the situation either, and the flight seems to have left with very little people since there was a huge amount of people in line at the time of departure.

2019-01-02,0.9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Newark,5.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,nothing negative at all,True,"  Orlando to Newark. My experience was nothing negative at all with this airline. I traveled with my son, from Newark NJ to Orlando, FL and back. Stopover on the way there in Atlanta, GA, but direct flight back. Was able to get ""big front seat"" for both of us for all flights. We each had a 'personal item', a carry on and a checked bag. More room in the combined bags then we could possibly use for the 7 day trip. I just followed the very clear instructions given for bag sizes and weights (of the checked bag, no weight limits on the other two). No issues what so ever with the bags. In fact, they didn't even check the size of the carry on or personal item bag on any flight. All flights were on time, and I was 2 hours early for each to get through TSA without any issues. Following these basic common sense rules, this was as stress free, no hassle experience. I can say, there were many issues my son and I were able to watch from a distance with other airlines and irate passengers over cancelled flights, delays, having to check oversize bags that couldn't be brought on as carry on's, etc. My point being, although so many people have shared their bad experience about bags and whatnot with regard to Spirit, I think a lot of this comes down to unrealistic expectations. Just my opinion based on my experience and observations. The ""big front seat"" option is worth the few extra bucks. Sure, when it was all said and done, with the cost of the cheap ticket, plus the bag fees, plus the big front seat fee, and I also paid the $59 to 'join the club' for discounts on these things - the ticket was no cheaper then any other airline. But - being 6'4 300lbs, and my son being 5'11"" and 200lbs, we rode like first class kings in my opinion. Basically, two seats in the same space as the typical 3 seat configuration, plus almost double the leg room. Total no brainer. And WAY cheaper then any other competitor 1st class offering. Is a bag of peanuts and can of Pepsi included? No, it's not. But then again, we just bought a few snacks and drinks at one of the little markets in the terminal before we got on the plane, and had no need to worry about it anyway. No wifi, no in flight movie. We each had our phone with us loaded with some games and movies, good to go. The one 'negative' I could say? The airport personnel in Florida were not particularly friendly. In fact, compared to Newark and Atlanta, the folks in Orlando were borderline rude and nasty. But really of no significance to me. I'm sure had my flight been cancelled, had they lost my bags, or some other bag thing happened, my review would be more negative overall, but honestly, not a single issue going or coming home. In flight staff and captains were all friendly, courteous, and professional. Plane was as clean (or dirty?) as any other airline I've flown. People some times talk about how the 'class of people' that fly Spirit is sub-par. I noticed no such issue, and the diversity of people on the 3 flights were of the same disparity as any other airline/flight I've been on. If you are looking to get a cheap $59 ticket and expect everything included, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a competitive cost flight and can score the big front seat deal, you will win and cheat the system a bit like I did.",1

I booked a round trip for my mom and grandmother from Ft Lauderdale to Tampa. They flew with no issues with a gym bag each (no carry on) from FTL. In the flight back from Tampa one of the staff member wanted to charged them extra for having a “carry on”, he said: “if they don’t pay for it, they will miss the flight.” Maybe your customer service team in every airport should be vigilant and know their policies so it doesn’t annoy customers off with lack of consistency.

Spirit deserves 0 stars. I bought a two-way flight from Dallas to Baltimore and then back, it cost around 310$ and it included my seats a check in bag, and a carry on for both my flights. Something came up, and I had to change the date of my flight back to Dallas. I had to pay an extra 200$ just to bring my flight a day back. They didn't refund my other ticket, they didn't even give me a discount or try to help me out with a better price for my ticket. I had no choice but to pay the 200$. Furthermore, the baggage price and the seating price I paid for my original two-way tickets apparently didn't work for my rescheduled ticket. I called Spirit and the lady told me since I changed my flight, I would have to pay for my bags and my seat again, and that they couldn't refund any of my money. So now I have to pay even more for my bags and a poor seat. Also, I would like to add that their service sucks, they don't got a drink cart, you have to pay for water, the seats are so small, I am 115 lbs and I can't even fit right. Overall I had a very displeasing experience. Spirit brags about being the cheapest in-America flights.

My flight was delayed 3 times and when I would inquire about it the front desk clerks would ignore me, tell me to look at the screen or send me away to another desk. I was waiting in front of one lady for 5 mins before she got off her phone and acknowledged me. I guess with cheap flights, Spirit hires the cheapest customer service representatives as well.

Shortly after his flight left at 1pm, my flight was delayed until about 8pm making my final destination arrival time now 12:30am instead of 10:50pm. Fine, it's not the first time I've had a flight delayed. I've finally landed in my layover destination only to be alerted that my flight is delayed again and honestly I'm fighting with myself not to lose it because I know it's not the crew's fault but this is absolutely absurd and unacceptable.

I am disgusted by this airlines and I will try everything in my powers to avoid flying with them again. It is basically a scam company because you think that you are getting a cheaper flight but in the end it's more expensive than other airlines. They charge you for everything. For example, I had a small brief case and a regular backpack with me. Well, the backpack cost me $65 at the gate to carry on to the plane. I also checked in a piece of luggage for $52. Well, guess what, the weight limit is only 40 pounds which is 10 pounds lighter than other airlines so I ended paying more because you'll need an extra bag which they will charge you over $50 dollars for. I heard an elderly lady on the plane complain that she just wanted a glass of water and they said that'll be $3 for a bottle. You have to pay for all beverages and food. I would rather take another airlines and pay more money up front just to avoid all the games they play to scam money out of you during your trip.",-1

Baggage claim took 40 minutes. I think the stewards were attempting casual humor, but instead made sexual referenced jokes and one about ""nothing's cheap on Spirit."" Finally something I agreed with.",-1

This was my first Spirit experience and I would be apprehensive to choose them after this experience. In Richmond after everyone was in line to board and many were on the plane we were asked to get off the plane. I was on the jetway. So we all disembark and find out there was a delay. The passengers that were to go to Houston were going to miss our connection in Orlando. The gate agent said “we are overbooked for a week out so stand in line and we will process a refund”. I couldn’t believe that was it. Just go back home and miss your holiday plans!! My $250 refund for a one way ticket is a joke. You can’t put a price on holiday memories! Many of these were military members as well coming from Ft Lee. They were traveling see wives, husbands, and kids for the holiday! The gate agents did find a later connection. As far as I know everyone arrived to Houston albeit 5 hours late. I do appreciate the gate agents in Richmond hard work, but the first solution was absolutely terrible customer service!",-1

Mostly rude attitudes from check In to on the plane. Try to charge extra $150.00 for my 2 checked bags which I told them when booking flight and that's what they allow. I had to throw everything in the dumpster across the street. I am also handicapped and no help what so ever from anyone.

2018-12-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Boston,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,highly incompetent employees,True," Worst customer service and airline ever. Arrived at the airport for a 1.5 hour domestic flight BWI to BOS. It took 2 hours and 5 mins to check a bag. They made everyone wait in one line after using the kiosk so the highly incompetent employees could organize the line barriers. I was there for two hours and they didn't figure out how to create a line for check bags. Did I mention we checked in at one of the only 4 working kiosks first (and yes there was a ridiculous line for that prior to anyone telling us we had to stand in the line to see an agent to check one bag). The bag cost me $84 and 2 hours of stress. This was a 6am flight. I chose this flight because I figured it would be easy in and out to the terminal. We arrived two hours early, and almost missed our flight! The atendants were rude and lazy. They told several of us, if you don't like it, call Spirit. They chose to put in Kiosks. Spend the extra $50 and fly Jet Blue or anyone else for that matter. Awful experience for me with two children.",-1

Flight was delayed which is out of their control but the fact that when you call they are of no help, you can barely understand them because their English is so bad and they want to keep referring you to the website to fix your problem which their site doesn't work and then they keep trying to sell you crap you don't need! My US Army Soldier got stranded in an airport he was never originally scheduled to be in and after hours of waiting they finally offered him a flight through another airline that I was able to look at and Google hours prior. His ticket they gave him has no confirmation number or e-ticket number to even check into his next flight so that means another long line in the morning after no sleep all night.

I’d like to rate this airline zero since it ruined my family Christmas trip. We got to the airport 2 hours before the scheduled departure time. The airline sent us a notice about an hour delay when we just got there. A little bit later, another notice came with another hour delay. Then there came another 3 notices with now the flight was delayed to 7:10pm instead of the original 2:28pm departure time. This is the first time for me flying Spirit Airlines and this has been the worst experience I have had for the past 20 years. It’s amazing that a corporation can run so low on credibility and changes their schedule so frequently without any explanation to the passengers. I can’t find anyone in the airport to ask for the reason or status. Terrible experience. I definitely will not recommend this flight to anyone and will never purchase their tickets again.",-1
2018-12-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst airline ever,False,"  Pittsburgh to Dallas. Worst airline ever. The flight been changed twice. The airline does not care whether you have a connecting flight or not. They will cancel flights on you without notice and you only receive a message or an email. Spirit airline need to improve their services, they overbook the airline and send you a message if you want to delay your departure. Its been a long time game they have been playing.  How can you stay at the airport for 6 hours waiting for a 2 hr flight and you miss a connecting flight which they can only apologize? Instead of overbooking why can you offer less service which is better to maintain customers rather than losing customers everyday. Y'all need to step up. I am very disappointed to have to stay at a hotel in Dallas because i have missed my connecting flight. Stay away from Spirit Airlines.",1
2018-12-20,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chicago,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,No better value,True,"  New York to Chicago. No better value for short flights if you know how to put their 9-dollar club membership to good use. My latest 3 flights between NYC and Chicago cost 48, 50 and 68 dollars round-trip, respectively. I fly a lot and mostly for a few days at time so a large backpack is sufficient and is always free. On short flights I don't need food or drinks but you can buy whatever you need before boarding. Yes, Spirit charges 2 dollars for bottomless coffee and 2 dollars for a bottle of water. I think I can live with that. I've seen a review where a traveler paid a little over 100 dollars for a flight but ended up spending 600 with ""hidden"" fees - there are no hidden fees. All their fees are advertised on the website. If I occasionally do need to check a bag, I pay 26 dollars each way (at time of booking). It's a few dollars more afterward. It's straightforward and easy. Fastest growing airline in the US. Youngest fleet in the US. Best on-time performance in the US. H",1

NK 240 We were supposed to fly at 5:28 arriving around 7:30 from San Juan Puerto Rico to Ft Lauderdale - the airline has changed the flight 2 times delaying the departure time. This is been a horrible experience since I purchased the tickets to this, they didn’t only gave me the wrong date, but they also keep delaying the departure time. Worst airline to travel with.

2018-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Ft Myers,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Totally ruined my trip,False,"  Minneapolis to Ft Myers. I booked a flight to see my family over Christmas, with my two cats, using the same TSA-approved cat carrier I’ve flown with at least 10 times. We’re getting ready to board and an agent suddenly tells me the carrier is “too big” and won’t fit under the seat, and that she was “giving me extra time” to “go somewhere in the airport” and BUY a new carrier. Wouldn’t listen to any evidence that the carrier is TSA-approved and collapses down to fit under seats. I even demonstrated it and told them I had flown THEIR airline many times before, with that carrier, with no difficulty. Supervisor wouldn’t listen. So I wheeled my cats in a wheelchair back and forth from one end of the Lindbergh terminal to another, desperately looking for a pet carrier in the shopping areas, but no luck. The store clerks were incredulous that the gate agents had even suggested that. On top of all this, the agents placed all the blame on me for not “knowing the dimension requirements” and would not acknowledge the carrier adjusts to fit. By that time my cats and I were both upset and the Spirit staff were even then totally unhelpful. The first woman even accused me of trying to “suffocate” my own cats by fitting the carrier under the seat. I’ll say again that I’ve flown with that cat carrier many times without incident. They didn’t care that it was the holiday season and did nothing to help me - all they did was change my flight to one three days later. Luggage was already loaded and “couldn’t be taken off.” What awful customer service - hostile attitudes, ridiculous suggestions. Totally ruined my trip and stressed out both me and my cats.",-1

Friendly staff and interesting boarding process on my route down south. We departed on time and arrived early. The gate changed from A17 to A16 but that didn't affect any plans from the schedule! You do have to purchase every thing in Economy class and thats a bit pricey. On this short flight I was able to survive and not buy anything. I do recommend flying them on short flights since they are an LLC but they operate like a normal carrier!,1

They charge you for every little thing they can to make up for it. Don’t let them fool you. I will never fly Spirit again. Tried to get rid of my carry on bag so I wouldn’t be charged their ridiculous carry on bag fee and then come to find out the weight limit on their check bags is 10Ibs lighter than all the other airlines -  therefore resulting in an additional fee (same as checking an entire other bag). Once getting inside the airplane, the air seemed to be completely shut off (do they want people to barf on the plane?). The seats do not recline and have very little space regardless of where you sit. Water not free (cause that makes sense).",-1

The service was horrible, sent to several lines before finally getting my checked bag checked in. A huge run around after paying almost 40.00 extra each direction for my checked bag, they had no notice of it. Spent over 45 minutes proving I paid for my checked bag.

Spirit is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. 2 weeks ago my flight was delayed 3 hrs with Spirit, which made me miss my transportation for the night (at my destination) so I had to stay at the airport until 7am. Also, the bag check lady really made me take out exactly 1 pound, so I ""don't have to pay the extra $30"". Are you kidding? You tell me my flight is 3hrs late, and I have to pay 30 bucks or take just 1 pound out? Then there's today. Another delay by Spirit which made me miss my ride by 20min. Now I'm stuck sitting at the airport again for another 2hrs for my transportation. Spirit is not worth the cheap ticket. I'll pay a little extra to fly with someone else from now on. I just found out that Spirit took all of my air mileage because I went 9 0days without purchasing a ticket. Don't waste your time, money, or anything on Spirit.",-1

Based on the extras you have to pay for, it is one of the most expensive. My Spirit flight flight no on Thanksgiving day on 11-22-18 was delayed from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale FL to the point that I would have missed my connecting Spirit flight from Fort Lauderdale to Ecuador. They would not do anything to help. I found a flight with another airline to get to Ft Lauderdale so I could make the 2nd leg of my flight. They assured me at the airport Spirit counter in Atlanta that they would reimburse me for the flight that I could not use due to delay and I have been on the phone with several customer service people of Spirit & none of them would provide me any relief, not a penny, not a future free flight equal to what I lost due to their error.",-1

Spirit Airlines needs to stop hiding fees. I chose the airline because they offered the lowest costing ticket only to find i had to pay for checkin and luggage after. They charge more for check in if not done more than 24 hours in advance - who checks in more than a day before? You are allow 40 lbs for carry on as opposed to regular 50lbs for other airlines and you can end up paying over $155 for over weight. I paid $105 for all in bags. 50 for check and 55 because i was 9 pounds over weight. Ridiculous! The seats are also not comfortable with very little leg room. Awful experience.

Nickle and diming everything. Should be upfront with any and all additional costs. When booking through Expedia there was no option to select carry on luggage, I didn't think anything of until cuz I never had to pay for carry-on,  until I flew with Spirit. Upon printing my boarding pass I noticed my ticket said 0 carry ons. So i go back on the kiosk to add 1 carry-on and I'm getting charged $55 for 1 carry on item. Upon making a complaint to an attendant she didnt care. She said pay it or leave your bag. Not only that they charge you if you want to pick a specific seat.

I am retired and my schedule is flexible and normally travel with only a backpack but do occasionally bring my dad and mother-in-law with bags.

I was shocked by the airlines inability to help customer. My wife had lost her wallet in the Airline, I went rushing to the airport 's Spirit Front Desk. Since I am done with my flight , they too were done with helping me. We were waiting for the ladies to help us and no they never wanted to help. We finally got a call saying please come and collect your wallet anytime tomorrow. I came to the Oakland Airport at 10 AM and I am still waiting as I write this review its 3PM already. With Spirit there is no way to speak to a Human Operator , The only time you can speak to one is when you book a ticket and thats 30$ extra to talk to that human. I feel I could have booked the same flight that I booked with Spirit with an American or A United and I could have had much better peace of mind. I wasted 2 days when I could have been helped and got my wallet back in 2 hours. The cost of a cheaper ticket was I had to waste one day of my salary and my peace of mind. As I was angry with my wife all the time for losing the wallet in the first place. I swear I would spend the extra dollars with other carrier for a safer and a smooth customer experience rather than flying Spirit.",-1

We and multiple others not in our group, were treated with disrespectful attitudes, ie if they must, they will grace us with their assistance to do their jobs of checking bags. In Seattle the carry on item size checker at gate was bigger than Las Vegas so on the return flight the rude gate agents were charging people $50-65 to bring on carry on items (that easily fit in the approved Seattle carry one size checker). Then I paid at the baggage check for one of my other bags $21 bucks to Vegas and after speaking to the supervisor was required to pay $50 (same bag, same weight, just different airport).

Well, at 12:30 AM they tell us that yes the flight is coming but they don’t have a pilot to fly it. So they are going to delay it another hour why they try and find a pilot. Bottom line is that you can’t count on this airline to get you to your destination. 5 years ago I flew this airline and this same thing happened. I swore I would never fly this airline again.

I took four flights via Spirit Airlines; from Seattle to Vegas, then Vegas to Houston and vice versa on my return. I looked at reviews prior to my trip and it had me incredibly worried. However, I was pleasantly surprised about the service I received whilst flying with Spirit Airlines. The trip went as planned and I believe on three of the four flights we arrived at our destination ahead of schedule, the last flight making it on time. The seats were a bit cramped but I wouldn't say they were uncomfortable. The flight attendants were kind and fun - I actually watched a flight attendant calm down a crying baby! All and all I felt safe and comfortable flying with Spirit. The price is really low but the service, in my own opinion, goes above what you pay for even still. No qualms.",1

Suitcases do not even include the carry-on bag and each suitcase you have to pay is 40 lbs. And it costs more than an airline charges for an extra 50lb bag. They have a disorganization of the worst that at the time of migration did not have enough staff to help passengers fill out the form through ATM to the point that they did not even speak Spanish and it was more difficult and many lost their flight. In short if I could not give stars I would do it so this is not worth one.  Es el peor viaje que he tenido, para empezar los aviones son tan pequeños que no tienes ni espacio para reclinar el asiento, Segundo te cobran por todo, ni siquiera un vaso con agua puedes pedir porque te lo cobran!! Las maletas no incluyen ni siquiera la maleta de mano y cada maleta que tienes que pagar son 40 lb y cuestan más de lo que cobra una aerolínea por una maleta extra de 50lb. Tienen una desorganización de lo peor que al momento de llegar a migración no tenían personal suficiente para ayudar a los pasajeros a llenar el formulario por medio de los atm al punto que ni siquiera hablaban español y era más difícil y muchos perdieron su vuelo.

She said I’ll have a receipt for you and you can walk through the short line. I said ok, well thank you, but how much are you running my card for? She said I’ll have your receipt for you in 1 second. Then she says your approved, go right through that line. I said ok and as I was standing in line, I noticed that she ran my card for $65. I walked out to go talk to her and another lady said that that is the price. I said can’t I just pay the check bag fee. I didn’t give anyone permission to just run my card for such an extreme amount. She said that I would have to go back downstairs, go through security and check my bag in and that I would miss my flight. She said it very rudely. All I could say to her was, I can’t believe you guys get away with this. I didn’t have the funds in my account to cover that charge until I arrived to my destination. They ran my card without permission from me with an amount of money they didn’t explain anywhere throughout the airport that this is what happens. I have flown many time with them with the same exact bag. They are a big company who gets away with treating people like trash. I’m writing this because I hope somebody reads this and doesn’t have it happen to them. I will never fly them again.",-1

Before I ever boarded the plane I was charged $52 for check in bag and my daughter in law was charged $57 for carry on and $7.99 for quicker check in which is bogus we had to stand in line with everyone else and go through the same routine check. Spirit Airlines are greedy, costly, rude, and terrible customer service. Returning home the airline checked in my bag and I paid $52 my daughter in law paid $57 they told me I was to early and would have to bring my bag back in one hour I explained my daughter in laws flight left in 1.5 hours and they said no exceptions. I returned with my luggage and the woman that initially took my $54 whispered to the other agent is had not been an hour it was only 50 minuets! The new agent checked my bag and charged an additional $55 she said it was over the weight limit and I could remove things. I said I have already been checked in and paid I am not paying $55 more dollars. She then called someone and said I will charge you $30 that is the most I can do for you. I was furious before we even started our vacation we knew we where out $264. There is no excuse for charging these ridiculous fees and nickel dimming you on the flight for everything! You cant even get a glass of water. I will tell everyone to avoid this airline. and to add insult to injury the last 15 minuets are spent trying to convince you to sign up for their credit card. Seriously I can only imagine how many hidden fees the card has!",-1

Will not allow online check ins so that your bag fees are cheaper. I was told today when booking with Expedia you don’t get that option. Airport checking is 50 for bag up to 40lbs. And additional 55 for bags 51-75 giving the impression that that 50 is the weight limit. No posted info on bags 40-50. Paid 116 for ticket and 155 I. Baggage fees. Will never fly this airline again.,-1

Spirit Airlines is the dollar store of airlines! While the tickets may have been inexpensive, the airline charges you for every little thing. Most airlines have a 50 pound weight limit on luggage, not Spirit! Not only do they have a 40 pound limit, you are charged for luggage. How do you travel from one side of the US to the other for 1 week without a bag that needs to be checked? On an almost 5 hour flight you'd think you'd get a snack? Well, you can get a drink or snack if you want to pay for it. The seating is cramped, and the tray table, if you can even call it that, is about the size of a woman's size 7 foot. My tray table was covered in nasty fingerprints - I was afraid to even touch anything in that plane. When I had to use the lavatory, I had to wait over 10 minutes because one of the flight attendants was in there fixing her hair. I will never fly this airline again in my life!",-1

2018-11-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never flying on Spirit again,False,  My husband and I flew from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale with 2 bags in which we paid $30 each. On our arrival to Atlanta our bags were over weight. The check-in attendant was a very nice lady who combined the weight from both bags and only charged us $30 extra. On our return flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta we knew our bags were overweight and expected the same charge as there was the same things in both the bags we flew in with. The first lady at the self check-in did the same. However when we did the final check-in for our bags the Attendant charged us an extra $55 on top of the $30. We got the first woman and the Two attendant discussed the problem. They disagreed with the fees for the weight. We tried to explain what Spirit did in Atlanta but the 2nd attendant did not care. She was very rude to us and argumentative. She was charging us a total of $85 not $30. We let her know there should be the same standards in all of Spirit Airlines not what each wants to charge. The two attendant just argued. One said she was going to get with the supervisor. We let them know we were never flying on Spirit again. We paid the fees just to meet our flight.,-1

Giving their hard earned money to a company that bluntly does not care about passenger experience or their health. Spirit Airlines is a no no, this is budget if you want to call it that travel at its worst. No food, no beverage not even water to take medication, no WiFi or screen with any information about flight status, very uncomfortable seats none reclining more like sitting on an iron plate with no padding, surprised when they didn’t have a cover fee to use the restroom or someone at the door charging a fee depending on bathroom necessities. Website is misleading by not allowing you to choose your seat without having to pay more money when a seat should be included with original fare. When did we go back to the The Flintstone era in flying.",-1

So do understand I was very skeptical about booking a flight with them. Surprisingly, I had no issues with my flight. The thing with low cost airlines is typically you have to pay for everything (carry-ons, seating, baggage, snacks etc). I went into purchasing this flight knowing that. So the extra costs for those things didnt bother me since I got the flight so cheap. Check in was a breeze. And i was  surprised to learn that if you have multiple luggage (I had 2 , one was 49 lbs and the other was 28 lbs ) and one is heavier than 40 lbs, Spirit wont charge you if the combined weight is under 80 lbs. So that was great. My flight was on time, and the area I sat in was very spacious for coach. I think peoples issue with spirit is they dont know about those additional charges. I have no complaints",1
2018-11-26,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Minneapolis,2.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,was pleasantly surprised,True,  Tampa to Minneapolis. I’ve read so many poor reviews for Spirit but was pleasantly surprised both to and from Tampa (home is MSP). We booked a last minute Thanksgiving trip and it was the only airline with direct flights the days we needed and within budget for a family of four. I knew the stipulations and we planned accordingly. Seats are comfortable but unless you upgrade what plane’s really are? Contemplating joining their “$9” club because I plan to use them a lot more now.,1

I will no longer fly with Spirit Airlines, regardless, of price for a ticket. They are unprofessional, lack sympathy of having a service dog. I was informed from a representative days before my flight, what documents are needed for my service dog. I was told bring an updated certified letter from my doctor, that's it. Well, turns out that is incorrect! I had to pay for my pet. American airlines did not give me such a hassle. American airlines have great deals for their customers including entertainment, AAdvantage program, great food, drinks, AC and professionalism. Moving forward, American Airlines will always be my first priority when I travel.",-1

So paid for two aisle seats before flight date. Get to airport and Spirit changes them to an aisle and a middle. Didn't notice until we went to gate but gate agent changed us back to two aisle seats. Get on plane and they have given one of our seats to someone else. She admittedly didn't pay for the seat but moved her anyway. So who ends up having to move - my husband and me to a window and an aisle with the whole row. Now although we had the row I am annoyed that I did not get what I paid for. As I write this we are 22 minutes late just sitting on the plane due to ""mechanical issue"". It's going to be a long day! I have not flown Spirit in years and this just reiterates some of the reasons why.",-1
2018-11-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never use this airline again,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Newark. This airline is terrible. The seats are small and you must pay to choose your small seat! They charge you for your bags, but your checked luggage can’t weigh more than 40lbs. Industry standard is 50 lbs. And they charge you for carry-on baggage! Once you are on the plane, you are charged for drinks. And if you want a snack you’re charged. My 8:45pm flight home was delayed. We received the first delay notice at 11am. Then, at 7:30pm, it was delayed to an even later time. When I asked the gate agent if this flight was eventually going to be cancelled, she brushed me off. I explained I needed to know the situation because I had childcare issues at home - again, I was brushed off. I called customer service, who told me it was delayed because of a mechanical issue. So, this mechanical issue was detected before 11am (when I received the first delay notice) and there were still issues at 8pm, causing this plane to be delayed until 10:10pm?  Why wasn’t something done about this or a new plane brought in? I will never use this airline again. I don’t even want their compensatory voucher!",-1

I travel a lot and this was by far the worst airline I have ever been on. As a first time spirit airline traveler, I wasn't aware that you would have to pay for a carry-on bag. At the ticket counter, the attendant clearly saw my carry-on but said that everything was okay. However, at the gate, they made me pay $65 to take my carry-on bag inside. The attendant was extremely rude when I told her that I wasn't told I would have to pay at the ticket counter. When I asked what my alternatives were, she said I could wait and fly in two days and pay for the carry-on at the ticket counter or not take my bag with me.  In addition to that, the flight was overbooked causing delays as they forced an elderly woman off the flight to give the seat to someone else. I will never fly with spirit airlines again and will tell all my family and friends not to fly with this airline either. BTW, the seats didn't recline, no entertainment, and next to nothing refreshments. Very stressful and bad experience. Stay away folks. Pay the extra few bucks and fly with any other airline.",-1

Book a flight for thanksgiving day and the flight was pushed back time after time claiming maintenance issues. Paid for all inclusive at a resort and all Spirit offered was a 50 dollar credit to use on a flight that must be booked within 60 days, and a meal voucher worth 21 dollars not even an entire meal covered by my all inclusive fee. Customer service at the gate was also terrible, we were updated via email before we were informed in person. Biggest mistake!

I’ve heard terrible things about Spirit so I was reluctant to fly it, however they took me by surprise! The seats were small and did not have much leg room but other than that it was great.

I don’t think I would use spirit if I was going somewhere far but for a simple cheap flight I will definitely fly with them again!",1

How about I am in the FLL airport from 10:30 am for a 12:30 Spirit Airlines flight, FLL to ATL and missed the flight by 2 mins. Why? Because; 1) there was no flight change notification over the PA for the gate change from G5 to G10; 2) The Customer Service Representative whom I was seated across from disappeared, otherwise, she was very busy on her personal phone; 3) When I asked the nearest Spirit personnel the status of my flight, they did not have any information; 4) When I got to the correct gate, the desk agent did not know what to do, even though the aircraft was still at the gate (I have her name and ID # in case you are interested) 5) I was told that it was my fault for not hearing the announcements which I did listen out for in the event of any delays,  b) not seeing a screen display that was not posted; not receiving any notification (even via email) that was not sent; and of course any other egregious acts that I committed as a seasoned traveler who has never missed a flight. I think was made my mouth remain agape during this series of events was the nonchalant and dismissive attitudes of the Spirit staff.

I paid for upgrades on seating and baggage and it was only honored on (1) leg of the flight. Then I had to pay additional money for baggage (that was previously paid for and should have been carry on), but I checked it as it was less expensive to pay for checked bag. I could not fight them at this point as my bag would have been held at the city I was flying from. Finally, the most frustrating part of the whole ordeal is that you cannot contact anyone in person. I was told via email to contact the (801) 401-2222 to talk to a human, which I could not find to exist. Also, I talked to the gate agent and she also instructed me to contact someone at that number, I responded that I did and could not speak with anyone, her response was ""Spirit does do things a bit differently"".",-1

Not even a glass of water is free on these economy flights. Not worth the savings in flight cost for the discomfort of the seats which, by the way, has the smallest tray tables ever seen. Additionally, every other airline I’ve used permitted a standard carry-on. Not this one. They make up the charges for each ticket by charging for a standard carry-on; and if you checked in online you’re suckered for the cost of that standard size bag. $65 at the gate. And forget the $9 Fare club. A bigger rip off. Before you purchase,see where they travel. It’s extremely limited. I’m committed not to using this airline again.",-1

I didn’t mind the individual charges for bags, seat selection, in-flight drinks/snacks, and pretty much every other service that is normally bundled in the mainstream airlines’ ticket prices. Bringing the cost of the ticket to within $100 of the larger airlines for the same flight. What I did mind was the lack of notice and honesty when our flight was delayed.

While in flight I ordered a coke (Because Spirit doesn't give you a complimentary drink) Since that flight I was charged 3 different times for different beverages some more than one drink per charge. When I called Spirit about it they apologized but said they use an outside party and we should cancel our card through our bank. Excuse me?

I can't stress that enough. They are most assuredly ""gangsters"" of the air. Usually when a person is being spirited away, it means something bad is happening. Not only do they charge you for everything, I  believe their prices are higher than better reputable airlines because of this. Their customer service needs to be improved.

Not so much coming from Las Vegas to Oakland the person behind the counter would not answer any questions would not do anything kept quoting the fact that is it a it is a self interactive kiosk to do your own check-in otherwise he needed to charge us $10 a person for any help. He would not even answer a single question was so rude. $50 each way for a 1 checked bag each way is very expensive, so maybe the flight being cheaper does not really matter because you're paying a lot more with a suitcase.

Me and my wife and two children got tricked from a third party ticket, saying that we could bring carry ons. And I’m sure they are in cahoots. You can’t, and they charge 50$ per person per bag per way. So a simple trip from Hartford to Orlando cost us 680$ instead of $380 we were expecting, Then after paying all that extra for the bags, when we got there our bags are all  damaged. They were previously brand new. We called when we got back because we were tired and were told it was too late to do anything about. Because 4 hours passed. Never use this company.",-1
2018-11-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Columbus,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,just not worth it,True,"  Spirit appears to be cheaper, but once you add the fees for each seat, each bag (including carry on), water, snacks, and checking in at the desk, it is just not worth it! I recently flew Spirit for the first time. I sweated and rushed and weighed my bags to make sure they were under 50 lbs. - the industry standard for checked bags. I get to the airport and use the desk to check in. There I am told that Spirit bags must be under 40 lbs! And I was asked if I wanted to continue. Uh, yeah. I was kind of stuck at that point, since my Uber had left. What was I going to do? Throw some of my clothes in the trash? So, yes, I had already paid $60 for one bag, then I had to pay $100 for the second bag and because they were over 40 lbs, I had to pay another $55. Once on the plane, with teensy weensy leg room (I could have paid more for bigger seats, I know, but I went for the cheapest seats), I was charged $10 for water and a snack. On the way home, the man at the check in desk was rude. On the flight, a flight attendant kept banging into my arm, and it was very, very difficult to reach anyone by phone at Spirit. They have no customer service selection option. I had to pretend I wanted to book another flight in order to reach another rude human being. Both rude people attempted to claim that Spirit's bag prices are easy to find on their website. They are not. The carry-on size for Spirit is also smaller than industry standard. Here's a great idea: warn people by email, especially first time travelers with your airline. I would so much rather fly Delta. I don't care if I have to pay $100 more, at least I know I will have great service and comfortable seats and wow - free water!",-1

We are now hours behind on our flight to Florida from Ohio due to a mechanical person not showing up at 5:30 am to start the plane and get it warmed up! You are going to hold your paying customers responsible for this when someone slacked off? This is Ohio, expect the weather elements to be bad and have a backup plan in place in case someone decides to ‘not show up to work’. Now we are sitting on the tarmac because yet again, there is another issue with an engine. I have never been so disgusted and disappointed with an airline service. They are offering all of us a credit towards a future flight - well, you can take my credit and give it to another Spirit Airline victim, because that’s what I am. An Unknowing Victim.

2018-11-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Akron OH to Orlando FL,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,have no customer service whatsoever,False,"  Worst experience I have ever had with an airline company. Our flight has now been delayed for over 18 hours and no compensation has been given except a $7 food voucher. No one at the ticket counter or at the gate has any information and even when they do it is not correct. My flight was supposed to leave at 7:30 pm, they kept us waiting around till 1 am before they said it would not leave tonight. It took them till 4 in the morning to get my checked bag back off the plane to give to me. I tried to explain to them I had medication in the bag that I needed to avoid a seizure but they would still not help me. The one staff at the gate just stood there and laughed at everyone and their situation. A woman on my flight was going to see her dying mother and her mother died before she got there because of this airlines incompetence. Please do not use or recommend this airline to anyone you know. They have no customer service whatsoever and could care less about their clientele.",-1

We were at the lounge and they sent an email at 9:35 saying that the flight was on time. We rushed through security and then we got to the gate with 20 minutes left but they closed the door and we couldn’t board. The ticket clearly says that we needed to be at the gate at 15 minutes before the scheduled departure times of 10:15. Spirit said the next flight out was 21:00 so we cancelled and flew United.,-1
2018-11-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Pittsburgh,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Do not use this airline,True," Do not use this airline! We booked our October trip to Pittsburgh in May. Spirit airlines cancelled our return flight in early June but did not notify us. We found out when we were unable to check in the evening before we were supposed to fly home. The customer service personnel told us that they would have tried to get in touch with us, but they didn’t have our information because we booked through a third party (Flight Hub). They also claimed to have refunded our fares but to this date, that has never happened. The representative also was unable to put us on another flight to get us back to Oakland on Monday but said they could get us on a flight to return on Wednesday. Needless to say, we spent $1100 to get ourselves back to our jobs and home in California. They took no responsibility for their incompetence in their lack of communication of the cancelled flight and sent us a $50 voucher to fly with them in the future which isn’t going to happen. In our opinion they should reimburse us for the flights we had to book to get home as well as the flight that they cancelled. Very poor business practice.",-1

I have used Spirit before and decided to fly this time once again. It was not this bad and now the service is really horrible. Don't book this airline based on the online price. Employees don't treat people with respect and they find every opportunity to charge passengers. Have the right price and let people travel with a carry on. I will not use Spirit to fly again.,-1

Las Vegas to Philadelphia. Worst experience ever! Do yourself a favor and do not fly with Spirit Airlines ! As a customer I expect to be treated like a human being and not like a moron. I flew from Las Vegas to Philly and I had a problem with my luggage and asked to speak to a manager at the Las Vegas Airport. Firstly he denied to show up when I asked to talk to a manager and when she decided to show up she showed the minimum of effort to fix the situation. I understand that dealing with different kind of personalities is a very difficult job, but in order to work in a costumer service industry you have to be a people person first of all. I was treated as a random person who is trying to get something for free. I am European and I have traveled all over the world and never felt this bad in my life. I try to understand everyone that works in customer service industry, because is a very difficult job, but this supervisor at the Las Vegas airport, didn't do the minimum effort to help me out.",-1
2018-11-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst experience,True,  Newark to Atlanta. Easily the worst experience flying in my life. We boarded and then sat at the gate for over an hour in the plane with no explanation as to why we weren’t leaving. Finally after an hour the pilot came on to tell us that there was a maintenance issue. They provided nothing to the passengers to make up for the inconvenience and instead hid in the back of the plane so no one could say anything to them,-1
2018-11-07,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Denver,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,the best it could be,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Denver. I am still sitting on the plane in Miami and I just had to share my experience so far. I usually buy my seats when I fly but my girlfriend decided to book our tickets this time and opted for the complimentary random seating. I approached the gate attendant and she kindly told me the policy on changing seats and said to speak with the flight attendants after all passengers had boarded. I spoke with staff and he was so pleasant and kind that I felt I had to share my thoughts! Out of the 100+ people on our flight, he assured me that he would try his best to find us a pair of seats so we could sit next to each other. He returned as quickly as he could, walked to the back of the plane and told us with a smile that he had found us a pair of seats!! He handled our bags for us and gave us the “honeymoon suite”  which was just in front of the emergency exits and only had two seats instead of three. Thank you Raymond for making our experience the best it could be!",1
2018-11-07,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Houston,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,complete indifference,True,"  Las Vegas to Houston. I understand the concept of this airline, bare bones, no extras whatsoever, and any level of customer service is replaced with attitude and complete indifference. If you are going to stop people to check if the personal size meets your size requirement than make it the same for all passengers, all the time - why target specific people and give them a hard time only to charge TWICE the amount at the gate, our personal experience was just fine on our initial flight to our destination, but somehow on the way home we are picked out of a line and asked to fit our bag in the stand (behind a line up of others) people were literally stuffing their bags in to this sizing stand, but apparently if your wheels stick out of the top you are okay?! My bag could have been squished in to the holder if I so choose to push and squish the way others were, but I am not about to put on this embarrassing performance as a female with a child. From a business perspective, this seems like an absolute waste of time and resources, having 4 gate people prying for who they can ding for twice the cost to have a personal item on board. Ultimately, all this is doing is annoying your clients, damaging your reputation and causing your employees to become walking attitudes who are so robotic there is no chance of a decent human to human conversation. Save yourself the trouble and fly with someone who appreciates their passengers.",-1
2018-11-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,fees at the baggage check-in,False,"  This is the worst airline I have traveled. The staff and service was atrocious. From the moment I checked in through the flight my experience was a nightmare. I was denied access at one point to go to the restroom because the seatbelt light was lit. The flight attendant put his foot on the door to hold it shut and refused to give me access. When I requested to please let me in he started making a scene. They charge unnecessary fees at the baggage check-in, also three dollars for a small bottle of water, and just overall rude people. When you book the flight it seems like it’s the lowest, but, by the time you’re done it turns out to be equal or higher. I will never never ever fly them again and will tell every person I know not to as well. If there is any savings at all, I promise, it is not worth it.",-1
2018-11-06,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Diego via Las Vegas,3.0,,5.0,,,3.0,5.0,meet the bare minimum,True,"  Houston to San Diego via Las Vegas. I've been flying Spirit Airlines for about 4 years; multiple trips Houston to LA, one trip Houston to Costa Rica and one trip Houston to San Diego. I have found them to meet the bare minimum. When they say bare fare they mean it. When they say they limit baggage size, they mean it. With Spirit Airlines they are crystal clear about their limits and expect you to stick to them. On a recent trip we found the check-in agents in Houston to be their usual/typical grumpy selves and the new Kiosks for self tagging baggage to be slow. Beyond that the gate agents and flight crew were great. The flight Houston to Las Vegas was on-time and the Las Vegas to San Diego was on-time too. One leg the aircraft had the bungee seat pocket and the tiny tray table the other had the older style tray table seat pocket. On the San Diego to Houston flight I found the San Diego check-in staff to be pleasant and actually friendly. Gate agents were friendly as well and the flight crew was also friendly. Only complaint was the equipment at the gate that provides power to the plane was not functioning properly and it took 20 minutes to get the engines started, not exactly Spirits problem but still they need to make sure their sub-contractors have proper equipment, as it ran the flight late getting in to Houston.",1
2018-11-06,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to New York City,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,Spirit serves a simple purpose,True," I've said this on another review site, and I'll say it here - if you take the time to read Spirit 101 on their website, you will not have any problems with this airline that are within your control. Most of the reviews I have read are complaining about baggage fees at the airport (tip: buy ahead of time online - you can even buy online before your board!), and it will be cheaper. If you don't want to purchase drinks or snacks on board, buy your own (after you clear TSA security). If you're unhappy with the seat comfort, pay the additional money for a larger, softer seat at the front of the plane. Spirit serves a simple purpose - transport you from A to B, safe and fast for the lowest possible cost. This was my third flight with this airline in one month and I typically fly business class on long haul. I purchased everything I needed for the flight online on their website, checked in online, arrived early to the airport to drop checked baggage and had zero issues with my flight. If you want to be pandered to and not have to pay for baggage or carry-ons or drinks, then pay the extra money and fly a full-service carrier, either way, you will be paying for it!",1
2018-11-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Miami,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,not efficient at all,True," Flew Newark to Miami with Spirit Airlines. Worst airline ever! Spend the extra money for United! The worst experience with the self tag kiosks, waited an hour for it to be fixed because there was one person at agent consultation. When the second window opened 45 minutes later she was actually decent at her job. Will not be flying again poor management, not efficient at all.",-1
2018-11-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,had somewhat of a bad surprise,True,"  My husband and I booked flights with Spirit Airlines as part of Expedia bundle package for flight and hotel. The Spirit flights were default option and the times suited us for both flights, so we booked return flight tickets. When flying Spirit on 11/2-4 we had somewhat of a bad surprise. The airline advertises itself as a budget airline. However, considering the sum of extra charges it is not all that budget and comes out more expensive than non budget airlines on the same route. With inadequate sitting arrangement without leg space and uncomfortable seats that do not recline, and requiring to pay even for a glass of water, Spirit Airlines are basically a rip off. To validate our impression of the rip off we booked our winter break bundle while in Vegas, with Expedia again, and chose flights with regular airlines. The tickets were $23.04 extra p/person each direction over Spirit fees. However, these airlines do not charge $45 for the right to carry one’s own carry on to stove in overhead bin, and they do not charge $$11-17 for choosing seat at check in time, i.e. less than 24 hours before flight. And you do not have to buy overpriced water at the airport to take with you on the plane, because airline saves on a glass of water for its passengers. So here are the numbers. By choosing non budget airline for our next break my husband and I will have to pay $23.04 extra per ticket that will put us back for $92.16. However, we will not have to pay extra $45 p/person p/flight for our carry ons, i.e. extra $180 total, and we’ll not have to pay at least $11 x 4 for choosing seats at check in time to ensure we sit together on the planes; and we do not need to buy water at airport either. So by not flying budget Spirit Airline we’ll save at least $132.84 on our next vacation’s flights in much more comfortable seats with complimentary drinks and snacks service. We have no complaints whatsoever about air and land crews. Their service was perfectly all right on our flights. First flight left over half an hour late but arrived only 15 mins or so late. The second flight left on time and arrived ahead of time.",-1

2018-11-05,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Las Vegas,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,5.0,Listen and read!,True," Portland to Las Vegas. After booking with Spirit, I read scores of negative reviews about delays, canceled flights, outrageous fees, and horrible service, and was very worried about my vacation. Then I saw something on reddit that made me feel much better. An honest reviewer said all problems are caused by 2 things. #1: Customers who don't do any research, read the terms and fees, then are upset to find them out. This is 100% their fault. #2: Delays and cancellations. This is almost always Spirit at fault. Before booking my flight, I looked over their web site and reviewed all baggage costs, maximum weight, and looked at pictures of inside the cabin. I also read several reviews on what to expect. Spirit does disclose all of this on their website. It is the customers responsibility to read it. If you don't, it is your own fault. Here is what I found out after I did my research. You get 1 free personal item (backpack, purse, laptop), carry on is $65 extra, checked bags are $40 if you pay online, or more if you pay in the terminal. Maximum 40 pounds or they charge for more. Seats are assigned unless you pay to pick a seat. No free drinks or food. You pay for it. Again, all of this is detailed on their website. Almost all the negative reviews I see are upset customers saying ""Oh my god they charged me $65 for my carry on! I am beyond furious and will never use them again!"" They do disclose this if you bothered to take 5 minutes and look, and before we boarded, a Spirit employee announced this over the intercom at least 4 times, and there were multiple signs. Listen and read! This is a no frills airline. No TV, no headphones, no wifi, no free food, and yes, the seats are extremely close and cramped. You are also paying much less than other airlines. I don't need luxury for 2 hours in the air. I prefer saving it. I checked other flights out of PDX and LAS for previous days on their website. Anything delayed or canceled? Not that I found. All of the left on time. Both airports had 2 flights out either that day or next day. For those customers complaining about being charged for carry on luggage, water, or picking a seat, if you spent 5 minutes and read their website, you would know that. Obviously you didn't even bother. That is your fault. Is Spirit perfect? Not even close. It's cheap and no frills. You aren't going to get a back massage or your feet rubbed. Do they have delays? Yes. I've flown United and AA, and they had them as well. Every airlines has problems. If you know what you are getting into, read reviews, fees, and know what to expect, there is nothing wrong with this airline. If you don't do any research, that is your fault, and you have nobody to blame for yourself. We have no complaints about our experience with Spirit Airlines.",1

I will never fly through this company again. I had round trip ticket from DFW to ORD. First, they cancel my round trip because I didn't cancel my flight before it took off even though I went to the booking counter. Then they tell me my entire flight including my trip back from ORD to DFW had been cancelled. They forced me to buy a whole new round trip ticket which I bought through American Airlines. I lost about 420.00 through Spirit Airlines. They refused to let me catch me flight back to DFW and kept saying that's their policy. They refused to give me a refund of any sort and denied my credit to buy another flight. Then when I call their customer service she told me what the policies were and I said I know what it is. I only asked to keep my flight back to my home airport so I'm not stranded. She kept me speak to a supervisor who repeated the policy and was useless. Then I spoke to the customer relations and they said the same thing. They were all useless. Lastly, the customer relations said that I cannot get an e-mail saying that I missed my flight. In fact, they said that they cannot send me an e-mail saying whether I caught my flight or not. So, I tell them they gave me an e-mail saying I made my flight saying ""flown"" which is an absolute lie. I never got on my flight yet there's an e mail saying I did. Yet, they can't give me an e mail saying I was a no show or cancelled. These people will take your money and play dumb.",-1

Our connecting flight was to be on the same plane, (we would have to deplane for a crew change and get back on) but at the last minute Spirit airlines made the announcement over the intercom that we would board another flight (while we were on our first flight). We were told to ""run fast"" as this other plane was leaving shortly. For an airline service to make this kind of announcement versus something along the lines of ""We have made arrangements for this aircraft to wait for you"" that would have been a lot less stressful and a little more accommodating.

2018-11-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Zero respect and customer service,True,"  Houston to Las Vegas. I am the biggest Phil Collins fan and we decided to have a small weekend get away to Las Vegas and see one of the final performances of this 2018 tour. We chose to fly with Spirit Airlines. Here is where we messed up, by choosing them! SO, are flight was at 9:30 AM on the 27th same day as the concert which was at 7:00 PM. The plan was to go there and have a full day of fun and adventure, we had both never been to Nevada before so the experience was going to be amazing. Our flight is at Bush Airport in Houston, we checked in that morning and had all of our paperwork, tickets etc. ready to go. We spoke with a rude and lazy Spirit employee who had no energy or any type of enthusiasm to help us find where we needed to be our help print our boarding passes (even though we already had them via mobile). That wasted a good 10/15 min right there after she finally understood where we needed to go and what we needed to do, we arrived at the security check in and show the male officer our boarding passes. Now here is where the fun begins. Our boarding passes did not work, nor were they the correct boarding pass, it had only downloaded the return home boarding pass. This was no user error by any means. We wasted another good 15 minutes there easily. After that we rushed back to the Spirit area and spoke to someone else who was just as clueless. She informed us that ""our boarding passes cannot be found."" What does that even mean? How can something not be in the system that was displayed and emailed to us with conformation! So that wasted another 5/10 minutes in addition to the Spirit Airlines wasting more of our time that privileged us to miss our flight! No big deal right, just get on the next one. Nope, booked! How about the next flight, also booked, there is one at 9:35 PM getting us there around 10:00 PM, (keep in mind the time change). I had to go speak with Delta and American Airlines which I had finally found a flight getting us there around 6:30 PM. We were able to squeeze into the concert as it was starting which was the only thing good about that day, besides being able to spend the day with my wife. After that we had to sight see for about 45 minutes before our Departure flight back to Houston. FUN huh... We were determined to see this concert even though our day was ruined we had to spend even more money we truly didn't have to waste on additional air line tickets. Never fly with Spirit. Zero respect and customer service.",-1

I vowed to never use Spirit Airlines after my last experience using them 4 years ago. That experience required that my flight was delayed due to their employees neglecting to come to work. Missing my appointment was detrimental to my employment and using a low quality travel provider was a poor choice on my part and I accepted the responsibility of my choice to use them. When I checked ticket costs for my most recent trip the spirit cost appeared exceptionally low so I made the mistake of booking with them again. Spirit charges fees for checked bags and higher fees for carry on bags. I attempted to use their online platform to pay the $45 fee each way for a carry on bag. The platform kept giving error messages and was not functional. When I arrived to pay the ridiculous fee upon check in they had raised the fee to $55 for my small bag. Duped again. Never again.,-1

My flight to Vegas was uneventful. However my flight back was a total disaster. I was told even though I paid for my flight a month previously that I was the last one to check in so since they apparently make the poor customer service choice regularly to over sell their flights I needed to wait and see if someone gives up their seat. So despite the fact you pay for your flight if the airline chooses to oversell you will be put on standby and you don’t even have to miss a flight. Then she tried to say all airlines do it, yet I only experienced it with Spirit! I’ll fly with the airlines in which paying for your flight reserves your seat!! Horrible, subpar service!!",-1

",True," Boston to Cancun via Wilmington. I fly on business weekly and have become accustomed to varying levels of service and generally try to balance all the factors (some things they did well, some not so) This was my first trip with Spirit and I have to say was was by far the most unpleasant flight experience I can recall. 1. Having to pay $65 for carry on? This was a surprise and I’ve not had to deal with this before. I got a bland response from gate agent who flatly stated ‘each airline has its own policies’ When I responded I fly many different airlines and have not seen this’ she simply shrugged and offered no explanation . 2. Cramped seats. Claustrophobic conditions. Flight full. Two large ladies to my left in worse shape. 3. Sulky flight attendants. No complimentary drinks, all for purchase. Scowled when you ask them a question and clearly did not want to be working there. On most flights I take I usually deal with one of these but the other characteristics make up. Spirit failed on all counts and I promise you I will never fly with that airline again. I’d rather pay premium for more enjoyable/tolerable experience than deal with this miserable lot.

The only reason to ever use Spirit Airlines is for a quick 1-2 day trip that requires only a small overnight bag/backpack (and you don’t have to be on time for anything important).

Free carry on bag. Everyone had a TV with shows and new movies, everyone had an outlet so they can charge their phone, we got free drinks and snacks. I flew Spirit back from Boston to Las Vegas and paid more money, and got absolutely nothing on the flight. No entertainment because there are no TV's, no outlets anywhere on the plane not even in the bathroom, no wifi, snacks and even water costs money - ridiculous, seat table is extremely small so you can't really put anything on it, seats do not recline, carry on costs more money than check in baggage - ridiculous, they get you there especially when you think it's free and you show up at the airport and you have to pay 65$ for a carry on bag.

As long as you have little to no luggage (40lb limit for $35 per person), little to no carry-on (tiny soft bag or pay $35 per person) don't care where you sit (or pay $7.00-$50.00 per person for a seat) and don't have no connecting flight (unless you have a 5hr + layover as a cushion) then you will get a great deal! Remember, you absolutely have to check in with Spirit at least 3hrs in advance! Because if your luggage isnt checked in 1.5 hrs before boarding, you risk the chance of being denied entry onto the plane. That's when the fees start adding up Also, only take direct flights when using Spirit. And I never fly Spirit in the winter (they're to risky with winter weather & possible cancellations)",1

I have flown with Spirit a dozen times this year, including internationally, with no issues. My last 3 flights were either on time or 10-15min early. Staff were reasonably friendly, seats were as expected (not comfortable), planes were no cleaner nor dirtier than any other US airline. Sometimes the lines are long for baggage & customer service. I wish the seats were more comfortable and that they offered water free of charge (as Frontier does). Otherwise completely satisfied.

By the time they nailed me with a $65 fee for our carry on bags and $25 (each way) for a water and snack I would have paid less on United, been way more comfortable and had a movie to watch.

Look for another airline if you would like to arrive at the time scheduled. This is my very first review of anything. I am so disappointed in Spirit's integrity that I felt compelled to post a review. First time I flew with Spirit was in August of 2018. That flight was delayed three separate occasions for a total delay of 6 hrs. I literally spent all day in the airport, missing an important meeting. At that point I swore I wouldn't fly Spirit again however, here I am two months later in the same position flight was just delayed 1hr. 33 min. And I'm sure this is just the beginning of another round of delays. I'm preparing myself to stay the night in the airport. The price point is ok, if you don't need to be on time. I would much rather pay more for a flight that arrives on time. Spirit is 0/2 in getting me to my destination on time. The real kick is that Spirit won't give a credit or voucher for their incompetence. I would be willing to bet that the executive board of Spirit doesn't even fly their own yellow bird. Not if they want to arrive in time anyways. It's my experience that Spirit falls very short in this area!",-1

Without too much of the typical boo hoo story of how they wronged me, I will just touch on the lack of any attempt to help me. A simple flight that had a departure of 3:15 turned into a full day and an extra $500. Flight from Atlanta to Atlantic City for a wedding. Arrived at kiosk for checkin at 2:25. Started process for check in - kiosk soon for what seemed to be about a minute or so. Then it comes up - too late to check in. We walk to the counter and they say sorry flight is closed “nothing we can do - you have to rebook “. Clearly we were there with enough time to check in and make the flight. They had no options, no help, didn’t care, and didn’t want to. They never suggested other flights - even though they had another leaving to NY which could have been an option. The crazy part is - do they save money by hiring people with absolutely no decision making ability? Do they actually set policies that allow no ability to help customers?  I think the policies are set and the lack of ability to help are deliberate tactics to do nothing more than generate revenue. Pretty sad and hopefully they will not last if this is their business model",-1

My complain is how the airline charges $50 for checking a bag or even worse that they charge $55 for a carryon. The other thing I didn’t like was the fact that the seats are ridiculously uncomfortable and they charge more money to pick your seat. It is supposed to be a cheap ticket but when you do the math of paying for the ticket, paying for taking a carryon and paying to have a seat, it’s better to choose another airline that charges about the same price or less and gives better service and more commodity. Again the staff was great. I just believe that this airline can do a lot better.",-1

I left San Diego on the 8:16 pm flight - flew to Las Vegas was on a two-hour layover went to board the plane for my red eye flight to Columbus Ohio (my hometown). The gate agent refused to let me board because she said I smelled like alcohol and my eyes were bloodshot - I have been up since 4 AM worked all day it as 11:30 PM PST, I was exhausted. I did not have any alcohol on the flight from San Diego to Las Vegas. My eyes agreed were blood shot because I was already exhausted from being up for more than 20 hours and I sat in the smoking cage inside the airport having a few cigarettes. I did have one Stella at the airport which my credit card can prove. To be denied boarding simply because my eyes were bloodshot, and I smelled of one drink is incomprehensible.",-1

We purchased our tickets for our anniversary on August 2 2018 to fly out on October 16 2018. We fly with my service animal Lola so, when purchasing our tickets I checked we have a service animal and called Spirit Airlines to check on specifications. I was told I needed to provide documentation from my doctor on his letterhead. Arrived at the airport and was checking in and handed the rude lady my documentation. She automatically had an attitude saying our policy changed on the 15th of October you have to pay $110 for your service animal. At first I was nice and explained that I purchased my tickets on Aug. 2nd and she said policy changed just so rude. I said it was BS and she was ready to kick me off of the plane. I have never been treated so rudely in all my life. Plus they want you to pay for your seat your baggage a soda and on and on. You better believe that all you get is a piece of paper saying you can get on the plane and you pay for the rest. I was afraid to go to the restroom. Thinking I would have to pay for it.

On my way back to Puerto Rico, traveling in flight #801 (12:44pm) Orlando to San Juan PR. I had a very bad experience during check in at the counter. There were five of us & the kiosk wouldn’t check us in, so we went to the counter where an agent assisted us. She was visibly in a very bad mood, making faces and visibly disgusted with having to check us in. We were very confused with the checked bag prices and the airline check in process, since it is different from other airlines and this was our first time flying This airline. I’m proficient in english, but I speak with an accent, I don’t know if that’s what was bothering her, or the fact that she had to explain to us how the whole system works. I gave her both my husband’s and my passport and she only returned mine. Then she started asking for my husband’s and I told her I had given it to her, she said she didn’t have it, but immediately noticed it was there on her counter. She gave it back to me, and when I took it, she said visibly disgusted, “Ma’am I would appreciate if you don’t grab things away from me”. I didn’t understand what was she referring to. So when she returned the credit card & I took it, she repeated the same thing, but visibly more disgusted. My daughter told her that we didn’t mean to be disrespectful, but she kept making faces. We ended up paying $335.00 for 5 checked in bags & 1 carry on bag. All of them under 40 pounds. We were finally checked in & I walked away from the counter, found a woman who said she was the supervisor and explained everything to her. I told the supervisor that since the Airline check-in process is so different from other airlines, they should have people in the counters that are more willing to explain to customers the whole process. Also, since Orlando is an international airport they should have agents that are more patient with customers whose primary language is not English. She didn’t write my name or anything, so I don’t think she’s going to do anything. The airplane was filthy.",-1

Every aspect of the process has an extra charge, or a new fee for ‘better’ service. However the staff were incredibly rude. At 4 am when I arrived, exhausted and bewildered (as I rarely travel) I was yelled at by the people working at check in. Three times they lost patience and raised their voices to a yell, I want to say scream but I don’t want to be melodramatic. I was clearly embarrassed, confused, and blushing. These people had zero empathy and were cruel and humiliating. Every Spirit Airlines employee I encountered was at the very least cold, and at the most aggressively disrespectful. I really feel that Spirit cares nothing for their passengers. They want only to make money, and it’s very clear. I will not ever ride with them again, I would rather pay for the privilege/human right of human decency. Seats are also tiny and uncomfortable.",-1

We arrive at the airport after getting off of a cruise only to find out the ticket will not open for about 2 hours. So we are forced to wait at the ticket counter until their shift starts. When we call customer service to ask why our email says ""make sure to arrive at least  2 or more hours before your flight "" but they won't open until they feel like it. We were told ""it's a generic email!"" Well the way obvious and not helpful at all. Then I was told of I paid extra I could get some fast pass through security.  It never worked for TSA and then the rep said if we wanted that reimbursed ""fill out a form and we will review it."" This airline is a joke and not worth the lower price.

Had to pay $700 for 3 one way tickets back home. Worse airline I’ve ever used. No WiFi, no tv, no snack and $3 beverages (soda). I was charged $160 for checking just 2 bags. Do not use Spirit.

Low prices not worth the headache and frustration. On the first leg of a 3 leg flight I was prepared to give Spirit 5 stars. I knew somewhat what I was getting myself into for a cheap flight. I bought a flight across the country with 2 layovers for a cheap price. I accepted the sub par service checking into my flight at Atlanta Airport because I understand that the employee training program couldn’t possibly be the best with what Spirit was charging (the workers at the check-in desk couldn’t perform simple tasks, let alone come close to performing their actual job). I even accepted the uncomfortable seating in the aircraft with seats that don’t recline and are so uncomfortable they caused me neck pain. The one quality I find unredeemable is unforeseen delays due to maintenance with no end in sight. This is the straw that broke the metaphorical camel’s back. While I impatiently await the next 15 minute intercom call to tell me the aircraft is still broke I took this time to advise you: if you can afford to pay a little extra, I highly recommend you do. The one job I pay the airline to do is to deliver me to my destination with minimal delays and to keep me informed of any delays and they failed this task. This is the first time I flew with Spirit, and it will most definitely be the last.",-1

This airline feels like it is being run by 10 year olds. Everyone was very young and the professionalism definitely reflected that. From the bag check counter through the flight we felt a huge lack of confidence. To start we had not traveled Spirit prior to this so I thought nothing of it until I went to go choose my seats and had to pay $6-$8 per person each flight and that's when the nickel and dining began. This carried through from purchase to bags to on flight everything was a cost! Immediately realized that this may have been a mistake to book. But then I got this email with the company's mission statement and thought ok I get it maybe I'm wrong. Nope! *Morning of flight Delayed *Bag check counter as we walked up all 4 employees were on their phones and when someone would speak everyone would giggle and laugh like a mini private party. *At the gate every announcement was stumbled over and then the attendants would again giggle at each other's mistakes. At this point we were on the plane same thing could not get through an announcement without stammering and laughing. The words chosen in the Announcements were so unprofessional. Instead of ""please"" it was ""go ahead"" or ""just"". Just take your seat, go ahead and just get your carry on put away. My favorite was ""You need to stay in you seatbelt"" There was one attendant that was over 35ish and we could clearly see she was having to really manage the other attendance to get things done like all of them were in training. I felt for her because it felt like the company she worked for was a joke and she cared about getting things done but was baby sitting. The seats were so thin we could feel knees in our back. We are average size people leaning to the smaller side and it was so tight. This is not a quality airline.",-1

If you are looking for a quick commute flight, about an hour, with 1 personal item, and flight attendants that are rude then this is the airline for you. We paid for our bags at the kiosk, only to be pulled at the gate while boarding to be told we must pay $60 per bag and ended up paying $65 each bag. While waiting at the gate there were 2 people screaming at the gate attendants. One person’s seat was double booked and they couldn’t get on the flight. The other person they were trying to recharge for their bag, just like they did to us! As if it was bad enough to pay $50 at the kiosk your made to pay an additional $65 at the gate? So $115 for a carry on bag? Get real Spirit! Should have known the kiosks were bad when it took us 20 minutes to use them! Service attendants are unhelpful and extremely rude! Never flying Spirit and will tell everyone I know to never fly with them. I could write a book about how bad of an experience this was.",-1

Last time I flew a checked bag was $25, Spirit charged $50 for each bag. On the way to Las Vegas my son carried his suitcase on- no hassles. His suitcase was 18x 10 x 6. Small. On the way home as we were boarding the gate attendants were randomly pulling people out of line and making them pay $65 for each bag. I was furious. Many people were walking on with bigger bags than my son’s with no problem. Why the extra $15 charge at the gate?? What a racket. There are those stupid metal bins to “test” your bag. Beware, if it doesn’t fit in the top small bin, you’re paying. No coffee, water, cookie, cracker on a 3 and a half hour flight unless you want to pay $4 for each item. A bag of M&Ms was $4. Really? Checking in at both Detroit and Las Vegas was a catastrophe. Mass confusion, no one knew where to go or what line they should be in. Probably 20-30 people in each line like cattle, and unsure if they were even in the right place. No direction from anyone. And of course you have to check your own self in at really slow kiosks. (No one to help you there either- you’re on your own Good luck) After landing to I called to inquire about the shake down at the boarding gate- more “excellent customer service”. You can’t even speak to a real person. I tried different prompts and couldn’t get anyone to talk to. I did get some kind of message saying I could pay $25 to speak to someone about booking another trip. Good one Spirit- I’ll never fly you again and will be sure to share my experiences with your lousy cheap poor service airline.

We get to check out & they tried to up-sell you a ton of add on' & I noticed we didn't have assigned seats. We're taking an 8 & 9 yr old so it's important we sit together. It's $7/person to select a seat, so another $35, but the return trip is $14/person, so we just spent $105 on seats. Annoying. I got an email 2 days before our flight saying we didn't buy bags. What?? I went online & it's $40 for each checked bag and $45 for a carry-on! And your bag can't weigh more than 40lbs. Not sure why they assume people can take a 5 day trip with just a ""personal item the size of a laptop bag or purse to go under the seat in front of you"". We had to pay $240 just for bags and had to combine them & still make sure we were under 40lbs. Today, the day before our flight, I get an email of an in-flight menu, snacks & drinks aren't included in the ticket price.  Our flights ended up costing $345 more.",-1

Website was difficult to use and kept trying to change the return leg which was not affected (as of yet). When trying to find a solution with customer service rep tentacles over the phone, they were difficult and patronizing. I’m more than capable of typing in my own name and confirmation. They were not able to have any other flights except something arriving over 28 hours after the original time. If I was to take a different connection with a long layover in a different city I could have arrived only 14 hours later, but Spirit Airlines would not accommodate a change such as this because it would be two separate flights. I offered to use the credit from to canceled keg towards one of these other “multi city” trips to be told they would expect 4 times the original payment to cover the changing destinations on short notice. I spent over an hour on the phone with two agents and also a supervisor. I would say I will never fly with them again, but they didn’t even give me the opportunity to do so.

I flew with Spirit many times prior to marriage and moving away from an airport that was serviced by Spirit, so you can imagine my excitement when you started service through my home airport, That said, I have never had such a terrible experience with any airline, or quite frankly, in day to day life, The employees on both flights were inconceivably rude, one of which snatched my drink out of my hand, another scolded the entire plane like we were toddlers over the loud speaker about putting our phones on airplane mode. All of this was excusable, Again, this is a budget airline. I'm not paying for good employees, but what really set me over the edge, and what truly gave me the drive to make sure, as a staple in the community, that everyone knows never to fly with Spirit out of Asheville when they can fly Allegiant who are friendly, caring, and accommodating, even though they have the same ""add-on"" fee and budget mentality. I arrived for a flight out with a 9 and a 2 year old out of Fort Lauderdale, 90 minutes prior to my flight. My app, and calendar generated boarding passes from OAK to IAH which was not my flight. (I'm flying from FLL to AVL) upon arrival to the airport, I tried from many agents to try to get help correcting this problem, I I was then bounced from agent to agent, no one knew what to do, finally, I'm sent to the kiosk again to check in and now its too late and they want to charge me $400+ to change my flight to tomorrow, We are 1 minute late for check in, due to the fault of your company, and have no bags to check and the line for security is <10 people long, but I am now out the cost of a rental car, another hotel room, and have two exhausted and extremely disappointed children waiting an extra day to get home. I chose to purchase flights for cheaper than rebooking these on Allegiant and will never fly Spirit again. Not an ounce of compassion, and the customer service number continually blamed me for not checking in 45 minutes prior to departure, and could not grasp that I was there and had checked in prior, that this was by no means my fault. I really hope to hear back, but doubt I will considering the level of customer care displayed by this company.",-1
2018-10-05,0.1,Business,Business Class,Houston to Newark,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit Airlines again,True,"  Houston to Newark. Worst Customer Service Experience. We booked and paid for 2 large seats 8 months in advance only to show up to the airport and be told that our seats were double booked and sold to someone else. Then be told by the agent that the person who our seats were sold to had not only not checked in for the flight yet but that he had not yet paid for the seats because his credit card was declined (too much of his private information to share with me). Then they brought the Supervisor over who didn’t even come speak to us and appeared to have NO clue what she was doing (in way over her head). She just whispered to the agent to tell us that there was nothing they could do we were basically screwed. So to Be clear: When I checked in for my flight I was told by the agent that the seats I booked and paid for 8 months in advance, were given to someone else who had not yet paid for the seats or checked in. How in the world does that make any sense? Not Only were my seats booked and paid for 8 months in advance, I was there, checked in and seats were paid for all while the other person wasn’t there, wasn’t checked in and hadn’t paid for the seats but the seats still went to them? It was the return flight of a round trip! Who doesn't show back up for their return flight? Especially on upgraded tickets booked 8 months in advance! How could these idiots resell our upgraded seats on a return flight of a round trip booked 8 months in advance? I cannot believe this is at all possible! Then when we get to the gate, they announce the flight was oversold by 7 seats! So 7 people missed their flight home. Just an awful airline. I’ll never fly Spirit Airlines again and will share this terrible experience with all of my friends, family, employees, customers and all colleagues to ensure that everybody I know and they know will never fly on this incompetent airline. Spend a few extra bucks and fly a better airline, don't make the same mistake I did!",-1

My first initial flight leaving out of Atlanta did not take off until an hour late. Now on the way coming back I was seated in the emergency aisle and was talking to my daughter on the phone and the flight attendant asked me if I had head phones and if not can I turn my phone down. At that present moment we were in the process of boarding the flight, we had people talking and on their devices at the same time. So we got through all of that and now it’s time to go over the safety information and she asked will I be able to assist in the state of an emergency so I do have a sense of humor and I am hesitant and she said we’ll we are going to have to move you and I told you are not going to move me. She goes up and speak with another flight attendant and she comes back there and speaks condescending to me as if I was slow. She asked everybody if they will be willing and I responded within the group and said yes. Then she looks at me asked me if I heard her and I said yes. I felt so uncomfortable during the whole flight and I never want to fly spirit ever again. The disrespect was just enough for me!",-1

They cancelled the flight, and I was offered a via flight, which I unfortunately accepted. The connection flights were over booked and I was stranded on Chicago airport for 28 hrs. Had to buy a brand new ticket from Chicago to Dallas from United. They said they have applied $50 credit on my account - 3 months later tried to redeem, and agent said, sorry, voucher cannot be extended, its expired. I got 'lucky' with 'lucky seat miles' (what a farce) and today when called to redeem, guess what, yes, expired! Been flying with this airline because I am cheap and can't afford to pay top $ for other standard airlines since 2014 - each month a trip earning close to 1200 miles - you'd guess you can buy at least half the sector, no, sorry you don't have enough miles.",-1

I don't understand how they're still in business. Customer service is disrespectful. We arrived the airlines 50mins to time with confirmed flights but we were told the airplane was boarding already so we couldn't get on it as our luggage needed to be checked in. 5 mins is plenty of time to check in a bag and go through security but not for Spirit. Long story short, we couldn't get on the airplane and had to pay $650 for an American airline flight to bring us to Dallas for the wedding we were attending. We told Mpls Spirit front desk worker,  we were going to return by Spirit. Of course when we go to the Dallas airport to return to Minnespolis, Spirit told us we they did not have seats for us on the return flight because they couldn't tell that we had flown to Dallas.Their only solution was to put us on a different the next evening, no apologies. It was then my responsibility to file a complaint when I returned to Minneapolis. No they don't try to put you on a different flight even when they mess up because every loss needs to be on the customer.  Horrible first experience with Spirit. Needless to say I'll never be flying by them again.",-1
2018-10-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Las Vegas,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit Airlines again,True,"  New Orleans to Las Vegas. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again. I went to Las Vegas for a work event and it was a very short trip (a little over 48 hours). My flight was supposed to land in Las Vegas at 5:13 PM on Sunday. The main reason I took this trip was for an event that Sunday at 7 PM. I spent over $200 for a ticket to this event and the transportation for the event left my hotel at 7 PM. I received an email notification that afternoon, on the way to the airport, stating that there was a delay because of the weather and my flight would not leave until 5:01 and therefore would not arrive in Las Vegas until 6:49. I understand that if the delay is because of weather the airline doesn’t offer any reimbursement, but the delay had nothing to do with the weather where I was flying out of or in to—apparently the plane that was supposed to take us from New Orleans to Las Vegas was delayed on the prior flight from Atlanta, GA to New Orleans, LA. I knew there was no way that I would make it to my hotel by 7 PM so I called Spirit because there were other Airlines (Southwest and United) that had flights that could still get me there on time. They would not refund me for my flight or do anything to reimburse me in any way stating that they couldn’t do anything unless it was a “2 hour delay or more”. It was an hour and 36 minute delay. The flight was delayed a second time and now would not arrive until 7:15, putting it over the “2 hour delay”, and when I called a second time they still refused to do anything. At this point it was too late to catch the United or Southwest flight, so I was going to miss my event regardless but did not want to cancel my trip altogether because I had already paid for a hotel. The customer service representative kept saying they didn’t know what I wanted them to do, I suggested a travel voucher or if they could even possibly reimburse me for my $50 checked bag, or give me a voucher to cover it on the return flight. They refused all suggestions and were very rude on the phone. When I attempted to talk to someone at the gate desk, the employee literally stood there playing on her phone for over 30 minutes and then looked up to see me still standing there and finally paged a supervisor to come and speak to me. The supervisor took over 30 minutes and was absolutely no help at all—redirecting me to telephone customer service.",-1

I have been flying this airline for over three years but my recent experience taught me a lesson never to fly them again. The staff are inexperienced, unprofessional and lacks basic common sense when it comes to customer service. We were ordered out the plane at a stop over in Atlanta and the staffs boarded the airline we came with without making a simple attempt to call names on the PA system before closing the gate. Their system would have known we checked-in and was suppose to be on that flight and they never applied basic common sense courtesy to announce names to account for passengers, as a result I missed my flight even though I was there at the next gate to find a seat. By the time I got to my gate, it was closed I was told I couldn’t board and yet I could see people still on the line inside the boarding ramp still attached to the plane making their way into the plane.",-1

I was here an hour and a half early but I was trying to find Spirit Airlines check in, and nobody seemed to know where it was.

2018-09-29,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Los Angeles,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,remains to be my favorite,True,"  Houston to Los Angeles. I've flown Spirit many times. From Los Angeles to Vegas, New York, Seattle, etc. I am always able to pack a rather large bag as my carry on and measure it to make sure it fits within their requirements as a ""personal item"", so it's always free. I always fly with wife and son and they bring their own bags as well, for free. Depending on the type of year and destination, Spirit can be hundreds of dollars cheaper than any other airline. Also because I never check in a bag I never have to wait in line, use the self serve kiosk and you're done in a few minutes. The staff has always been helpful, professional, and friendly. I take a stroller with me, which is also free and they check it in for me at the gate as I'm getting ready to board. You do have to pay $7 to be able to choose your seats or you can let them choose. We've always let them choose and all 3 of us have always sat together. They don't have in flight entertainment but that helps keep the tickets so cheap - that's less money that they need to spend. I also love how they have the fake leather seats, I feel it's much more sanitary than the cloth seats. I've never had an issue with Spirit. There was one time my flight got delayed due to weather but you know what, It happens. And the delay was maybe 2 hours. For everyone complaining that they couldn't get their money back for a missed flight, etc. It just sounds like you didn't take advantage of the $13 warranty that they offer. I've flown with Virgin, Delta, Alaska, United, Southwest, etc, and have had all the issues from cancelled flights to lost baggage and Spirit still remains to be my favorite.",1

Due to the hurricane in SC. Plans had to change for an upcoming parents weekend trip. I was on the phone with a CSR to change to my ticket to a ticket in my daughter's name for a flight at a later date. I understood I could NOT change my ticket to my daughter's name, even for a fee. I was told I could receive a credit of 72.00 for a 235.00 ticket. The only option and I agreed. When trying to use that ticket to book another flight it would not let me book a new flight in her name. I was not told that a credit is only usable in the originator's name. I called CSR back and asked to reinstate the ticket. That was not an option - I lose a 72.00 credit if not used in 30 days and the total round-trip ticket. I feel like this company does not care about their customers. In the future, I will find other airlines to use- will not trust in them again.",-1

Now this is the same bag I flew on America and l paid the same amount as l paid online with Spirit! When l told agent this, she says different airlines have different weight requirements! The plane was late of course you are last to board if you dont pay to use the bins. What in the hell has happened to flying? You are stuffed in like sardines and have to pay for any snack you want. Then deplaning is a trip too since you have to wait for the others to get the stuff out of their bins.

Our flight out of Minneapolis was cancelled late on a Thursday night, due to bad weather. Bad weather is a valid reason - but what is deplorable is that Spirit had no backup planes available for at least 48-72 hours. Additionally, Spirit has no agreement to rebook with another airline. We were forced to wait 48-72 hours, and hope for a seat, or spend $1,000 for 2 tickets for another flight one-way.

2018-09-17,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Houston,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,definitely fly Spirit again,True,"  My son and I flew direct, round trip from Seattle to Houston for a grand total of $400, including one checked bag and drinks. That is at least a couple hundred dollars less than any other airline. Here's what we paid for: Round trip tickets Seattle-Houston $153 each x 2 = $306. (That's extremely cheap) One checked bag ($35 each way) = $70 Two waters, one Coke, one beer (a nice IPA) = $16 Two Cokes, one tea (On the way back we brought food and snacks with us, plus I took two empty disposable plastic water bottles, and filled them up after security, which saved me $6) = $8.  They have larger seats, which appear to be the same in the 1st class sections of the domestic carriers that you can reserve for $50 more, but you need to reserve them as soon as the seat reservations open because I assume they go fact. Both the check in crew and cabin crew were great. Personable, friendly, positive, and helpful. I recommend this airline to others, unless you have children, in which case probably no because: If you're traveling with children and you want to guarantee a seats next to each other, you have to pay extra for that.  You have to pay for carry on bags. All those drinks add up.  With kids, of course you have checked bags, which also cost. I decided not to pay for the additional (which was maybe $20) to guarantee that my son and I sat together. He's 13, and would have been fine with not sitting with me, but in fact we still had seats together both ways. All the costs are on their website, so run the numbers and compare it with the other airlines to see which makes more sense. I would definitely fly Spirit again, and in fact plan to use them when I spend a weekend visiting a friend in Las Vegas later in the year. On that trip I'll get by with bringing just what fits in a shoulder pack (which is free).",1

My flight out of Chicago left a few minutes early which I thought was great as it would leave me more time with my layover. Somehow we landed over 30 minutes late which left me rushing to my terminal. By the time I got there they had already finished boarding. I immediately rushed over to the customer service stand and explained my situation. As I'm trying to get something worked out I can see my plane for the next 15 minutes still sit at the terminal. I was told there was nothing they could do as it was out of there control with the plan being late. That they could offer suggestions on where I can get a hotel for the night which I would be paying for out of pocket until the next flight over 12 hours later. They couldn't offer any food or hotel vouchers. Whole time this conversation is happening the lady helping me was talking to her co-worker also laughing in my face. When I asked to speak to the manager because at this point it was beyond acceptable the lady she was laughing with and talking to instead of helping me chimed In she was in fact the manager and there is nothing they could do for me. All of this adds into the horrible customer service which led me to having to cancel two round trip tickets previously for my daughter and myself due to the hurrican hitting south Carolina and me having to change my plans. On those I didnt get reimbursed I only got a partial credit. I will never fly spirit again. This is unacceptable treatment of their customers.,-1

Spirit is a great airline with no hassles, it's quick and cheap for the weekend or 2-day-rounds out of town! However, expect to fly like with just what you've got on or you'll rack up the cost with every key stroke. Don't fall for the $9 fare club - its nothing more than nonsense! Take it from a frequent flyer. Don't get too excited if you're ever the lucky seat winner of 5000 spirit miles - I was one of them. Once you try to book a flight with the ""gifted miles"" you'll quickly learn that its a scam to get you to apply for their MasterCard. Spirit don't deceive people with cheap tricks - you're already cheap down to no water on the flight.",1
2018-09-15,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Baltimore,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I was very pleased once again,True,"  This was my second trip with Spirit Airlines and I was very pleased once again. Boarding was a bit chaotic, but once on the plane everything went smooth and efficiently. Food and beverage service started almost immediately once we were in the air, the crew were very friendly and looked happy to be there. They made an effort to interact with the passengers and help us as needed. Towards the end during the credit card sales pitch, the couple next to me had a few questions about it and the flight attendant was willing to help them out and was very friendly. The pilots were also interactive with us and were always keeping us updated. The seats were very comfortable, legroom was pretty good, and the aircraft was very clean. Overall an excellent experience with Spirit!",1
2018-09-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Baltimore,,,,,,,1.0,sell the seat to somebody else,False,"  I made a reservation to fly from Houston to Baltimore September 17th through the 20th then hurricane Florence produced and landfall was in North Carolina predicted to drop 20 to 30 inch of water in and around Washington DC Baltimore Maryland Virginia South Carolina North Carolina so I cancelled my flight on the 9th of September so I wouldn't have to face fighting the water where the hurricane and come to find out they're going to charge 100 dollars to cancel the flight out of $186 so they can keep the price low I attach their email what they tell me so you know I'm not telling a lie - sorry excuse then they'll sell the seat to somebody else for the $186 and make a profit. Be the last time I make a reservation with Spirit Airlines. Don, I understand that you are worried because of the Hurricane Florence. Currently, we have an active travel advisory for Hurricane Florence. However, Baltimore is not yet listed on the affected cities. The listed cities on the travel advisory for Hurricane Florence are: - Asheville, NC (AVL) - Greensboro, NC (GSO) - Myrtle Beach, SC (MYR) - Richmond, VA (RIC) You can cancel your reservation at any time by going to www.spirit.com. Click the ""My Trips""and then, enter your last name and confirmation code *******. If you do choose to cancel your reservation online, a charge of $90.00 will be applied to the reservation or 100.00 if done with a Reservation Agent, along with the $19.99 passenger usage fee if the booking was made online. Please note that refunds will only be provided if a guest cancelled a booking within 24 hours and the travel date reserved is more than 7 days from the time of reservation. I'm so sorry, however, waiving the charge to change or cancel a ticket isn’t an option we offer. Our decisions are based on a desire to provide the lowest possible fares to all of our Guests. By waiving charges we’re spreading the operating cost over fewer guest, and in turn, increasing fares. We make all our guidelines available on our website through the help section and terms and conditions to ensure they are fully aware prior to securing their booking. It's a shame you cannot score this below zero for everything you have to score one for a review or I would do zero all the way down.",-1
2018-09-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Boston,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,plane left 10 minutes ago,True,"  I heard about all the bad reviews, now I know why. After a wonderful Labor Day weekend wedding, we were delayed in Boston by 30 minutes to catch a Spirit connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale. Arrived at Ft. Lauderdale, ran to the gate to catch the flight to Atlanta, and was told the plane left 10 minutes ago. Spirit left us there. I mean dropped us off in Florida, and left us to fend for ourselves. I asked why the plane wouldn't wait. The agent said, “we have to leave on time”.  There were plenty of flights that I was on that the pilot informed us that he was going to wait for some passengers that were delayed on another flight. Spirit delayed our flight in Boston and left us knowing we were on that flight. Told us the next flight out was in 2 days and we would have to wait. Eventually, after calling security on us, needless to say I was just a little upset, they gave us a 40% discount for some hotel. A hotel in Ft. Lauderdale for $90.00 before the discount?  I will say this tho, they left our baggage. They took our bags off the plane because they knew we were coming in on a delayed Spirit flight, to catch a Spirit connecting flight, and that we wouldn't be landing on time. Their demeanor was cold and uncaring. That blew me away too! Our flight landed at 10:30 PM or so and by 12:40  I decided to bite the bullet and rent a car. I called Enterprise, told him of our dilemma, and he said they close at 1:00 but will wait. Those people were wonderful! They got us car in no time flat and we were on our way. Drove thru the night and got to the Atlanta Airport to get my car at 11 in the morning.  So if you decide to chance it, Have a Ball! BTW, baggage fees were $45.00 each way for each bag online. To pay at check-in, it would have been $100.00 each way for each bag.",-1

The overall flight wasn't really the issue. We didn't experience any major issues on board. However, Spirit Airlines has too many fees to keep track of. I booked a flight and modified it within the very same day (not even 10 minutes later) and was charged for a 'modification fee' on top of everything else. Wasn't all too impressed with the overall experience to be a returning customer. With all of the fees that you'd end up paying with them, you'd be better off taking a different airline company.

Staff in the airport in LAX were unorganized. The flight attendants on the actual flight were very rude. They were impolite to the other passengers behind me, and the ones on my row.

Charged to check a single bag in twice because the flight had a stop in Myrtle Beach. So I was charged $50 twice (totalling $100) because ""the flight is involves changing planes"". I told them that when I got the ticket, it was a single flight. But they insisted that it is company policy. How can you charge for a single bag twice because the trip includes a stop which is the company's making. This is absolute extortion. Spirit appears to provide cheaper rates but by the time you includes charges and fees, it gets more expensive. This was a horrible experience and I will never fly Spirit again.",-1
2018-09-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Dallas/ Fort Worth,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,worst flight I’ve experienced,True," I booked a nonstop one way flight from LaGuardia New York City to Dallas/Fort Worth for $245+ $65 for a carry on. The ride was from 1:30-4:30 but I end up arriving at 9pm. Apparently there was a thunder storm so we had to stop at Houston for a little more than an hour. This already sounds false because it wasn’t even raining that hard and other airlines arrived in Fort Worth on time. At first almost half of the plane was empty, stopping at Houston we had a full flight going to Dallas. After boarding on to the plane in Houston we had to wait extra 40 minutes for other new passengers to arrive. I bet the whole point of stopping at Houston was to pick up passengers. After wasting my whole day on this flight they gave me a $50 voucher. This is the worst flight I’ve experienced. First time riding with Spirit and never again. If I can give them 0/10 as a rating I would.",-1

Wonder if there's a catch? Well, there is. As so many have testified to, it's not worth it. Pay the extra money for a real airline and get where you need to if at all possible. We had a moderate rain storm in Dallas and my flight was delayed over 9 hours, with the return flight stuck in Houston for several hours. We got 5 updates of the estimated time for our flight to get to Philadelphia from Dallas. We were told 6:30, 7:30, 11:30, 12:30, and  3:30am!

This airline needs to learn customer service, its employees are rude, disrespectful and unhelpful. So I boarded the plane row 3 isle seat and center seat are for me and my companion. The plane is almost ready for departure when a Spirit employee boarded and stops at my row as the window seat is empty. She proceeds to open the overhead bin which is full and proclaims to passengers seated in the area and to the attendants I need accommodation. They need to move their bags under their seats. First of all I paid for my seat and my luggage I'm not moving anything. She was flying gratis and had paid nothing for this flight. She manages to get her space she demanded takes her seat and we are off. I have Parkinson's disease early stages so I have shakes and tremors that come and go that I can't control. Stress tends to make them worse and I was under tremendous stress as 2 days earlier I had been assaulted and robbed at gunpoint in the apartment I was staying in while away on holiday. This employee from Spirit looks at me and says you need to stop that referring to my twitching/jumpy leg. As I proceed to try to apologize and explain she says do your thing just don't disturb me. I have filed complaints with Spirit, even once we landed in Fort Lauderdale the attendants and a supervisor apologised and took my statement. At this point not only from this experience but what I witnessed from the flights I have now taken I would never fly this airline called Spirit again. Being a cost competitive airline doesn't allow you to disregard or mistreat your customers, it merely means you must adopt a strict model for keeping cost down, a smile and helpful customer service attitude is free this isn't where you skimp.",-1

2018-09-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Save money on another airline,False,"  Seattle to Las Vegas. Save money on another airline. I purchased 2 RT tickets for $120 each. Then we paid $55 each both ways for luggage - $220! I could have purchased another seat for my luggage and saved $100. They also charge to go to the counter ($10), to choose your seat ($16-30), for water ($3) etc.  The seats were a joke covered in 1/2 inch of foam and faux leather. The backs were uncovered and had no pocket, and the tiniest tray table you’ve ever seen! My (small) tablet was larger than the table. In lieu of a pocket, they had a couple bungee cords to hold up the safety card, but failed miserably due to the previously mentioned plastic seat. The flight attendants were nice, however they do not assist you with lifting your baggage into the overhead bin. For $55 I felt like my clothes should come out dry cleaned and my shoes shined, much less a tad bit of assistance. I am thankful that I got a little cup of ice for free (FREE!) so I could make my gin and soda with the soda water I got at Hudson News and the mini guns I got and carried on in a quart-sized baggie (travel tip - a quart-sized bag holds quite a few of those tiny bottles!) So, we paid $660 for a $440 trip. It could have been $800 had we talked to an agent, chosen seats, and had a soda and tiny snack that are all free on most other airlines.",-1

When we asked them what we could do because we needed to get back home they literally said, ""I'm sorry but we cant help you until Wednesday!"" We canceled the flight because it is going to storm!"" with the most disgusting attitude. The thing was there were other flights that were still flying to Chicago. I was extremely disappointed that they couldn't take time to help us find another flight. We spent an hour running in the airport trying to find a flight home. We almost had one but it was taken right as we were paying for the flight. My husband and I had no choice but to drive 13 hours home to Chicago! If you going to canceled a flight 2 hours before take off please either A) Help your guests find other flights home. B) Cancel in a more convenient time bc we could have tried to find a flight home sooner or started driving way sooner. This happened at 4pm flight was at 6.15pm.

In addition to the horrible in flight service, my luggage returned from baggage claim completely destroyed - as were the souvenirs I had purchased on my trip.

They said they could rebook me but why would that ever be acceptable when I have plans in my destination city. They are fully focused on trying to rip you off and the person at the gate stated “tough luck”. Are you serious with this, you don’t even try to hide being an airline that hires unprofessional / rude people. I hope you make this right to at least one person if you don’t make it right for me.

They are awful. Choosing to fly with them ruined my weekend. I bought a ticket roundtrip to Nicaragua. At the airport I need to spend another $990 on two planes tickets with other airlines that would actually take me to Nicaragua. I spent 2 nights in airports and instead of Nicaragua Spirit left me in San Pedro Sula, somewhere I had never been before which google says is the most dangerous city on earth. Spirit Airlines is an organization that only knows how to take your money. This was the worst flight experience of my life. A one stop 7 hour flight 5 day weekend with friends turned into 4 days of flying and 1 day at my destination. We waited by the gate to board in Philadelphia. Thirty minutes prior to departure we asked the Spirit gate agent what time the flight boards. The gate agent told us the flight was closed. That made no sense, one of my fellow passengers told the Spirit gate agent. The gate agent, to my shocked surprise, began cursing at the passenger. No one at the airport could help me. The two gate agents were mean and rude. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with three different customer service agents, none of which spoke English very well. One agent advised me to rent a car and drive from Philadelphia airport to Pittsburgh, to catch a flight leaving about 90 minutes later. Philadelphia is about a 5 hour drive to Pittsburgh. Eventually I found my own way from Philadelphia to my connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale. They did not let me on the Fort Lauderdale to Managua flight (for which I had a ticket) so I slept in the airport. They treat you as the customer like the enemy.

I spent 12 hours, yes 12 hours at the NOLA airport waiting to get home to Dallas. First of all, what was supposed to be a 1.35 hour flight turned into a 12 hour nightmare! Secondly, a ticket that initially cost $325, turned into damn near $900 in baggage fees! Departing from DFW to NOLA, was ok. The flight was on time, no problem to get to our ship in NOLA and spent 7 glorious days on a Caribbean vacation that was spectacular! Trying to get home is where the nightmare began! We arrived at the airport at 10 am after our ship docked around 8:00 am. After arriving to the airport, we tried checking in, but were denied because we were told that we couldn't go to our gate until 4 hours before departure, (DFW doesn't have those restrictions from the many past experiences I've had), so we had no choice but to wait outside the terminal. 4 hours later we got through the TSA terminal and our plane was on time when we arrived at the gate. 45 minutes after arriving the flight to Columbus, OH got delayed and their flight got changed to 1:00 am departure because the plane at their gate was sitting with mechanical problems, but our flight was still on time. 1 hour later, Spirit offered the Columbus passangers vouchers for food, our flight got delayed slightly too, the plane we were to take was behind taking off from Baton Rouge, 30 minute flight to NOLA. Suddenly our flight was pushed out to a 1.01am departure. To make a long story short, the plane for Dallas was diverted to take Columbus guests home. But the airline's employees were lying or their supervisors were lying to us saying there were weather related issues (weatherbug was clear between Baton Rouge and NOLA). They routed a plane from Las Vegas to NOLA to take us back to Dallas because Spirit ran out of functional planes and they kept giving us lame stories on why our plane that was only 1/2 hour away supposedly having issues with the weather, but the storm had passed away hours ahead of the flight and all clear. Spirit tried offering food vouchers when they knew the restaurants in the airport were closed. Our flight schedules to arrive in Dallas at 3:00 am! The only reason we got vouchers was because my husband and I insisted they do the same offer as the Columbus OH passengers received. Never ever will I fly this budget airline again, you get what you pay for. Had I spent the same money on American I could be in my bed resting at 11:00 pm. If your time is as precious as mine, please fly any other airline.",-1

They told me I have a flight out in 3 days and they will not pay for hotel or food because it is not their fault it is weather.

My hotel was canceled, my family who made it to Lima on Delta were waiting for me. When I finally made it to Lima it was time to head back to the States. The delay emails from Spirit start to roll in. My flight was delayed, not to mention I paid 350 dollars to get it moved to another day. My flight to the States was delayed 4 hours.

When I booked online, they changed the dates of my return. Next flight, we waited for three hours in line just to be sent to the kiosk and back to the counter to be told that our flight was delayed and that we wouldn’t make our connection. They ended up putting us up on a hotel and sending us with a different airline. When it was time to come back, they said our itinerary was cancelled because we didn’t fly with them to our destination. They offered no other solution than to give our return flight money back. After going that and purchasing one way tickets with another airline they sent a confirmation message for the flight that we didn’t show up and for which we were offered our money back. Ah, and my husband was supposed to meet us at our destination and his flight was delayed as well and he wouldn’t be able to make his connection, so they had to refund him as well. I have yet to see if our money gets actually refunded. So many screw ups!",-1

Right before we were ready to leave, we were told that we needed to deboard as this plane was supposed to go to LA. We got off and watched the LA passengers get on. They then announced that our flight was cancelled due to maintenance issues, which was obviously not true since they used the same plane to fly across the country. We then waited in line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher. They only had one person there to assist us and while she was doing her best, it was ridiculous that this took so long. We all agreed if they had just been honest with us and did what it took to make it up to us, we would have been more understanding. As the passengers started comparing notes, there were many stories of Spirit showing poor customer service time and time again. I will not be purchasing another ticket from this airline!",-1

2018-08-21,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Atlanta,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,2.0,"absolute worst flying experience""
",False,"  
Baltimore to Atlanta. I fly often enough that my 10 month old has already been on 11 flights with me. This weekend was by far the absolute worst flying experience of my life. My family will never be using this airline again. On our way to Atlanta, I checked in online because I knew I would be short on time between leaving work and checking in. When I arrived and waited in the baggage drop line, I was told to go check back in again at the kiosk and get back in line. When I repeated what I had already done, wasting valuable time, the baggage claim lady took forever to type in my information. When I said something, she told me I “had an hour, plenty of time.” By the time she finished and I waited forever through security (bear in mind I had a baby whose stroller, car seat, formula and bottles all had to be swabbed) and got to my gate, they were already almost finished boarding. I didn’t even have time to change my son’s wet diaper before I had to rush onto the plane and the baggage woman was intentionally taking her own sweet time. This is an airport. Every person here is operating under a tight deadline. Spirit attendants should be mindful of that. Once boarded, we were told we would be sitting on the runway for 20 minutes. Then we were told we were going back to the gate to drop someone off. Then we had to do paperwork again for push back. Then we had to get in the back of the line and wait another 30 minutes for take-off. Meanwhile, it’s way past my very wet infant son’s bedtime and he’s screaming. When we finally land, we have to wait again for a gate to open up. Then we have to let everyone with a connecting flight get off first. These parts are not Spirit’s direct fault, but given how frustrating this was, all should have been done to make the rest of our trip as smooth as possible. Instead, when we all deplaned, us families were still left waiting in the hall for our strollers until a flight attendant finally noticed and went outside to find the workers who were supposed to have brought them up. Then they brought up our stroller missing a piece! I cannot fathom why anyone took it off in the first place but I had to find someone to go back down and look for it. Again, this was our eleventh flight with this stroller and we have never had an issue. At this point I just want to get to my destination and put my son to bed but when we got to baggage claim, my suitcase was in a bin busted completely open with my stuff hanging out everywhere for anyone to see or take. At that point I was furious and exhausted and wanted to get away from Spirit as quickly as I could. My fiancé and I decided in that exact moment never to book with Spirit again. On our way back to Baltimore, I checked in online and then again at the kiosk. At baggage drop, there were three workers available. I walked up to one and started to get out my ID and boarding pass. She was talking to the worker next to her and continued talking and talking for a few minutes while I stared at her. Finally, she turned to me and said “check in at the kiosk,” hardly an acceptable greeting for a paying customer. I told her I already did and she told me I should have waited in the line until she called me up. I have a plane to catch! Why don’t Spirit employees understand that? In two different cities I had bag drop people delay me for no apparent reason.",-1
2018-08-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles via Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,they oversold my flight,False,  Seattle to Los Angeles via Las Vegas. I wish I could say that I had flown on Spirit Airlines but they oversold my flight and then gave away the seat that I had paid for an upgrade fee to somebody else and then informed me that the next available flight they could get me on was 48 hours later with no compensation. The girls at the front desk were ridiculously rude their customer service is awful. I would rather walk than ever have to fly Spirit Airlines again,-1
2018-08-20,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Atlanta,4.0,,3.0,1.0,,4.0,5.0,Overall great value,True,"  Los Angeles to Atlanta. Two last minute tickets from LAX to Atlanta cost me $59 ea one way & I had plenty of options to choose from, so I chose the earliest flight in case it got delayed. The lowest fare from other airlines was $500 before taxes for the worst flight that had multi-stops and a 4 hr layover, the best flight cost almost $900 for two people. I hope these reviews do not mess up the cheap flights that you can get with this airline. My trip was great & we had a 4 hr delay, but I planned ahead. I booked my flight for an early departure so even if we were delayed we would still get to our destination at a reasonable time. We made flexible accommodations for arrival at our hotel ( check in until 7am). Paid for checked baggage when booking( so cost us about $60 total for two bags), packed our things smart to get the most out of the 40lb limit, still had almost 15lb extra in ea bag & we took all of our clothes (buy lightweight luggage- pack heavy stuff in smallest luggage, lighter stuff in bigger luggage), utilized the two free personal bags to the max (packed all of child's heavy pants/ jeans in my 18"" personal bag (no weight limit just has to fit in personal bag space on aircraft there is a bin for you to test this out at check in). We checked in 24 hrs ahead via spirit app, so it took 2 min at the kiosk to print our boarding passes and luggage tags. We arrived 3 hrs early, an extra hour early than recommended for domestic flights in case we ran into issues. Customer service was good because we had no complaints, we knew that to get these prices, the airline did not keep extra planes & pilots available to cover delayed flights like more expensive airlines do, and that everything was al la carte. We took care of our own needs by considering the tips spirit/airport suggested: bringing our own snacks and entertainment and being well prepared. We didn't buy the $11 insurance, but considering the Logistics behind this airline, it may be smart to do so. I did witness two cancelled flights and they were offered refunds or to wait for the next available flight. Insurance apparently reimburses for hotel stays, having to purchase new tickets, and for lost baggage ( if you want to ensure you get your baggage, arrive early to get your bags on the plane, that's just flying 101). Our seats were also very roomy and comfortable, and I am a plus size woman. I saw tall men and bigger sized people also seated comfortably. Our seats were together because they were purchased in one transaction, don't want to pay to choose seats then purchase your tickets in one transaction, there is an option to see how many seats are available b4 buying, so if there are only a few left, you probably shouldn't buy them if you're wanting to sit together. Overall great value, $180 2 ppl 4 bags.",1

The worst of the worst, never fly on this airline! I flew on them a few years back FLL to Las Vegas, and it was terrible. So I thought to give them a chance again, hoping that maybe something improved, and booked a flight from FLL to Atlantic City. I paid extra for front seats for me and my husband, bags, etc about a month ago when I made reservation. I received and email today which was very deceiving as it just stated "" Spirit Airlines Flight Confirmation XXX"" , nothing to draw you attention that something was changed. Upon my review I noticed that my husband's seat was changed from front seat which we paid extra for to a seat in the middle which is much less than what we paid (regular seat). And they still showed the full amount for total, which did not add up when you look at their itemized charges! They changed the seat without any warning, tried to not refund any money, they were trying to cheat, it is this simple. I called Spirit, the lady on the phone had a stupid excuse and said there was a glitch in the system, and that she is very sorry, but there is nothing they can do. She was even trying not to refund the money back when I told her that if we can not get our seat back, the seat we paid , then we want a full refund for the reservation. She was trying to tell me that ticket is not refundable, what a nerve! I was got very upset, the manager which they put on the phone was not much better, it seems that they do not give a damn. So I am cancelling the flight and purchasing another flight on Delta.",-1

Have never flown this airline before and needed a cheap ticket so I chose Spirit without looking into it (my fault). My gate said a different destination so I asked the lady at the desk to confirm I was at the right gate. She didn’t even look up at me and told me it’s correct. On the way to Vegas, gate got changed once, not a huge deal. Most uncomfortable seat ever, overbooked flight, just not pleasant. Didn’t even get an option to purchase in sky WiFi. Drinks cost money, including water, checked baggage prices are insane and you even have to pay for a carry on! Though that was my own fault for not looking into prior. On my way back to Chicago, flight was delayed by an hour, causing me to miss my bus. We actually arrived about a half an hour after the delayed time. Had to sit on the runway because no gates were open for the plane for 30 minutes. Turns out the plane that was supposed to be moving for us was vacant and parked for the night, which apparently no staff knew until another 40 minutes later. While the flight attendants were friendly, they were not very apologetic and just said “life happens like that sometimes”. Deservingly, they emailed everyone a $50 voucher for another spirit flight of choice but I will not be using it. I refuse to fly Spirit ever again. Tickets are cheap, but the added costs and worthless service make it a terrible experience.",-1

Received an E-mail informing me that I could do check-in now the day before, Didn't let me after entering last name and conformation no. Tried the day of my departure, still no luck, same thing happened at the Kiosk in the airport. A worker came over and directed me to the desk, where my boarding pass and baggage was completed. When I finally boarded, I noticed that the seat that was assigned to me was a middle seat, with arm rest that couldn't be lifted. I beckoned the attendant over and informed her that I was not comfortable, I suffer with arthritis, sciatica nerve pain, and asked if she could ask if someone could switch seats with me, she informed me that we had a full flight and walked away. Not only was my seat uncomfortable, but my legs were up against the seat in front of me. By the time I got off the plane, I was in deep pain and could hardly walk.

While this airline is super affordable, their business communications practices are garbage! I attempted to book a flight multiple times. I never once got confirmation that the booking was canceled (due to a repeated issue on their end). I finally had to go through a third party site to book it because their website is nonsense. I was almost willing to pay an extreme amount more just so I didn't have to fly on the airline. What it boils down it is don't count on actually having an official booking because they will cancel it at the drop of a hat and not inform you at all, completely stranding you where you are.",-1

Then changed our gate three times~ boarded the plane and the attendant was rude, and didn’t welcome the passengers~ like it was too much to smile and speak kindly, the plane was freezing, I asked for a blanket and the attendant was totally rude~only to say there aren’t any.

She rescheduled us to today which is a day later at 8 pm and now my flight is delayed once again, my sister is giving birth and I have missed it due to spirit airlines not knowing what they’re doing. After I’m stressed about my flight being canceled I have to deal with an extremely rude and unprofessional staff. I will never fly Spirit again.

However, upon checkin, I learned that it was not a nonstop flight and that it stops in Vegas. I complained but the guy at the counter told me that It’s the same plane so we won’t have to get off the plane, hence they call it a non stop flight for that reason. I complained again at check in and their response was that they would refund my money, knowing full well that I wouldn’t do that because it was the last minute and there would be no way I could find a flight home for me and my 12 yr old daughter. So we get on the flight. Upon arrival to Vegas, it turns we did had to get off the plane and board a different aircraft - so the guy in Seattle lied. When I called Spirit customer service afterwards they wouldn’t do a thing - no credit, no voucher - they didn’t care about my problem. They said the moment I agreed to get on the plane, it was no longer their problem! It didn’t matter that what I purchased was not what I got. It was supposed to be a nonstop flight. I would never have purchased a red-eye flight that had a layover. No sleep and therefore could not go to work the following day.

Upon arrival at the airport for departure we were directed to the automated kiosks to check-in and print boarding passes. I was surprised to find out that there is not only a carry-on bag fee but also a fee to select specific seats (rather than randomly assigned ones). While traveling with my wife we obviously want to sit together so we paid the fee for seat selection. After the baggage fee and seat selection fee, the rates were pretty much on par with other airlines so where are my savings? i'll give you a hint, there are none - on the actual plane, the seats seem cramped and they are not comfortable at all. Even with flying the early flight out and the late flight for our return trip, it was extremely difficult to get comfortable and get any shut-eye. There was no drink cart so I do not know if drinks are additional cost. During return trip, there was an hour long delay that was communicated via the loud speaker, but it was extremely difficult to make out what they were saying. I will not fly this airline again.",-1

I swore to God after my previous experiences that I would never book with this airline again. It seems he has cursed me. It’s funny how trying to save a few bucks often leads to bad decisions. I’m currently sitting at the boarding gate for a completely full airplane. It is again being delayed because their boarding system is down. Two years ago dealt with a six hour delay to Denver. Flying back from Cancun last year they overbooked the plane and we were denied boarding despite having rickets and arriving on time. They rebooked on a different airline and we had to wait five hours to fly out. We were delayed three hours leaving Cabo San Lucas on a trip later that year due to maintenance problem with a plane.

Our family has flown on Spirit Airlines two times in the last 12 months. Both experiences were complete nightmares and we've decided to never, ever fly this airline again. Some of the problems we encountered: grumpy, surly and/or rude staff generally; poor communication about flight delays; complete disorganization at the gates; one flight was 4 hours delayed without any problems in the weather in our departure or arrival city and we got four different answers from four different staff members as to reason for the lengthy delay; one time, Spirit had so many delayed flights leaving from the same gate area that there were no seats left for people to even sit on so lots of people, my daughter and I included, had to sit for more than 2 hours on a gross, dirty airport floor. I've advised my friends and family to never fly Spirit because of my family's experiences and I would suggest you save yourself the hassle and not fly Spirit either. Yes, they offer cheap airfare, but the price you pay in terms of terrible customer service and inconvenience is not at all worth it!",-1
2018-08-10,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Houston,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,5.0,on time with no issues at all,True,"  Denver to Houston. It seems to me that majority of reviewers who fly this airline expect more than what they are. Spirit advertises it's ""Bare Fair"" that gets you from point A to B. That is why the prices are so low. If you want a premium experience, fly a premium airline. Okay, now for my review. It was an early morning flight leaving from DEN to IAH at about 7:30 am. The equipment was N578NK for those that are into that sort of thing. The plane was on time. I had a middle seat near the back of the plane. It would have been worth the $12 to select a window seat nearer to the front. The flight arrived on time with no issues at all. That is what I paid for. I was a little discouraged by the $9 fair club. I didn't save much on the flight. In retrospect, if I wanted all the frills, it would have saved me money immediately. I have since booked two other flights at $50.00 round trip each. I certainly paid for the membership with savings. The key is to search the deals when they send you the email sale alerts.",1

More than three emails with time changes. Airline states: now we have an aircraft for you... sorry but they didn’t even tell us that there wasn’t an aircraft in the first place. People got on the plane so drunk but it was such chaos that the flight attendants didn’t notice. I have no problem with flying with a cheap airline and giving up some luxuries the bigger airlines have to offer. But that in no way gives an airline an excuse to be disorganized and frantic. It’s as if they just started operating the airline today. I’ve taken three flights with Spirit. One has been cancelled. The other two have been delayed by over two hours. They offer free miles while in the air to one “lucky” person. Each time I hear this I quiver in my seat just thinking I would ever want to participate in any program by this airline. Horrible 1/5 stars. The seat was very dirty plane was not clean (on any of my flights with Spirit). If You’re going to fly spirit. I would suggest: Bring only one carry on, don’t buy it. And buy the big front seat at the airport it’s much cheaper and definitely worth it.",-1
2018-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Cancun,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Hidden baggage fees,True,"  Hidden baggage fees when checking in. Flight was delayed, I could go on and on. Expect nothing free to drink or eat on this flight unless you're willing to pay  more. They won't even offer a cup of ice water. This airline needs major improvements!! Do not the $9.00 fare club, because it will  cost you $59.00 which is non refundable!  This airline is cheaper upfront, but you will certainly pay more on the back end of things. I hated this airline and will never ever board another Spirit aircraft again - and the seats don't recline.",-1

They are by far the worst airline ever. So we arrived 2hrs ahead of time for our flight and went to the terminal that was on our ticket, turned out they switched the terminal last minute and didn’t notify us. Plus the plane left earlier than it was suppose to leave. Once we realized that they had switched the terminal we ran fast as we could to get to the right one. The checkin lady had informed us that we had just missed the flight. It was about 7:15 the flight leaves at 7:20. We all was crying and upset because we was told that the next flight didn’t leave for 2 more days and that we would be on standby. This was the worst plane experience that I have ever had. The supervisor was unsympathetic and unapologetic at what had happened. They didn’t care that they failed to inform us of the terminal change. Over 7 people missed their flight because of this. I would give them -0 but it’s not a option. We couldn’t even get water on the plane it was $3. It cost more for a carry on bag than for luggage. This airline is a totally rip off.",-1

I fly delta and only pay $25 for a 50# bag. And I'm allowed 2 carry on items with no charge. Spirit charged me $42 for a 40# bag plus an additional $65 for a carry on item. All in all my baggage cost over $100. Never again will I fly Spirit.,-1

We took a family vacation from New Orleans to Las Vegas and then returned. Because of a line at the kiosk we were not able to print our luggage tags out on time. Machine said 3 minutes late. We were stuck for 2 days to get another flight out.  We paid for the large up front seats and the were fixed at straight up, no recline and do not recline. The flight from Las Vegas back to New Orleans had 1 working toilet for over 100 passengers on a 3+ hour flight. This airline should be shut down it is so bad. Called customer service who were totally useless. I asked for a supervisor and was transferred to someone in Central America. Stay away from this airline.",-1

First, to check in, you have to do it online, and not at the counter or it will be $10/pp. You have to check in even your smallest luggage, because to carry it on is $45. To check in is $40. Then, to reserve a seat, because you have to travel with a child or something, it's either $34/seat or $17 on top of what you already paid for. The worst of all, is the seats don't recline. They don't serve you anything not even water. The plane is the worst I've seen. If you think you're saving $$ by flying Spirit, think again.",-1

You think your getting a good deal, but they charge you a ridiculous amount fir anything extra. I was not charged for my carry on when leaving to Chicago, but on my return to gate they charged me $65. The ticket agent told me that I was sent an email regarding this charge to which I was not. Customer should be told ahead of time about this. Besides the additional fee, seats didn’t go back and table in front was the size of a postcard. Not worth the money or aggravation.",-1

I had to wait in line with every one else. I'm 6'7"" and need back surgery but I paid extra for a big seat to fly from Tampa to Detroit for my nieces wedding. It appears they switched the type of plane so I was put in a normal seat. It was a painful flight. This also happened to the guy with the window seat. A gate person took our boarding passes and returned them saying we would get a free flight. When I checked my credit card I was given a $15 credit. I complained to Spirit and received a credit for the difference between a normal and a big seat. Don't use Spirit Airlines",-1
2018-08-06,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Montego Bay via Ft. Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,apathy and callousness,False,"  Myrtle Beach to Montego Bay via Ft. Lauderdale. Spirit Airlines is horrible. They nickel and dime you for everything. The flight to Jamaica was fine. Leaving Montego Bay, the flight was delayed. Therefore, we missed our connection in Ft. Lauderdale. Our daughter had to be in Atlanta by 3 pm, so we had to purchase a ticket to Atlanta, because our new flight did not leave until the NEXT night. We had to wait 24 hours. This is the second time that we missed our connection from Montego Bay to Myrtle Beach. Last year it was the weather and we had to pay for our own hotel room! This year, it was their fault so they paid for our hotel. We went from the Iberostar Grande Rose Hall, to the Ramada Inn. The Agent at the Ft. Lauderdale counter initially told us that we received incorrect information from Jamaica and that we had time to make our flight, therefore, they could not provide accommodations. My husband got upset, I told him that I knew we were getting a room, because the people on the flight with us were at the counter next to us being booked at the Doubletree. The ticket agent then began to scold me about my tone. I explained to her that i was speaking to my husband and she had no right to chastise me about MY tone, when i was not speaking to her. I was furious. Once she realized that she was wrong, she never apologized for causing even more stress for us who had to wait in line for an hour to speak with her about the vouchers and boarding passes. She then books us at the Ramada and when i asked why we were not going to the Doubletree, she said the computer assigned the rooms. I told her that I would believe her if she had not just said that we were not entitled to a room. Now, we check out at 11 am and have to sit in the airport with a 69 year old and a 70 year old until our flight leaves at 8:20. This is unacceptable. When my husband complained to the agent she told him that there were other airlines!  This is two years in a row and I will not fly Spirit like this anymore. No one was sympathetic. No one apologized. Being stranded in a strange city with 5 people, two being senior citizens with health AND mobility problems is very stressful. I understand mechanical difficulties. I do not understand the overall level of apathy and callousness.",-1

Flight was cancelled on August 2nd for the 8:45pm flight due to weather. Got rescheduled to August 4th at 6:00am (that was their soonest availability which is really inconvenient). Then the August 4th flight got cancelled because the pilot never showed up to Newark. Then the closest reschedule date was August 6th which was when my vacation ended so I decided to get a refund. Do not fly with Spirit, worst decision ever. They also make you pay for just about everything including seats, snacks, and carry-ons and check ins.",-1
2018-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,unprofessional and ridiculous,True,"  Boston to Las Vegas. Worst airline ever! Save yourself a trouble, time, frustration, disappointment, money and don't book with them. So here is what happened to me. I booked a return flight Boston-Vegas for $325. Due to bad weather they cancelled my flight from Boston to Vegas on August 3rd, 2018 (Friday) 2 hrs before departure. When I spoke to their customer service they told me that the earliest next flight to Vegas was Monday (3 days later). My trip was supposed to be Friday-Monday so obviously it didn't make sense to go there on Monday and come back Monday. When I asked for a refund they only refund me $205 for my first flight that was cancelled. However, they didn't want to refund my return flight (Vegas to Boston) b/c according to them that flight was not cancelled. Obviously I couldn't be in Vegas to take the return flight b/c they never took me to Vegas in the first place. They are ridiculous. So basically, they sold me a return flight for $325, couldn't get me to Vegas, returned $205 for the flight to Vegas, charged me $120 for a flight back from Vegas even though they never took me to Vegas. They literally robbed me of my trip, made me miss a family gathering that I planned 2 months in advance, made me wait 3hrs to speak with them, and at the end charged me $120 for it. They never provided any service and charged me $120. This is so unprofessional and ridiculous. I still can't believe this is legal to do.",-1

Last year I flew with Spirit Airlines and there were many problems due to delays and faults of the agents that were resolved. We decided to give Spirit Airlines another shot this year. Our flight from Newark to Puerto Rico with a stop at fort Lauderdale was on time with no problems. However on the trip back there was. I was checking the flights online and realized they have been running about 3-4 hours late due to weather. On the date of our flight we received an email before boarding the plane from Aguadilla, PR that our connecting flight was cancelled. They do not reimburse anything if the delay was not their fault. You will receive a voucher that will expire within a month. The voucher probably only covers the extra fees. Not to mention we were flying with our 6 small children and the agent at check in sat the children alone and us, the parents, 10 seats in front. After insisting we sit together another agent helped make the switch, after everyone boarded. What a nightmare. Our flight has been changed for 2 days from now and we are stuck in Florida trying to figure out where to stay.",-1
2018-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Las Vegas via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,vouchers are not compensation,True,"  Minneapolis to Las Vegas via Denver. Our flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas was severely delayed by over half a day, so we were offered flight vouchers for the value of $100 each with Spirit Airlines. At first, we accepted, this sounded great! However, it's impossible to use them. Spirit Airlines travel vouchers are not compensation. They expire within 1 month. You cannot transfer them. You cannot book under another name. You alone MUST use them. The flight vouchers only remove the flight portion of the ticket. You cannot combine them with miles. You must pay for an expensive ticket to use them.  The flight portion of the ticket is actually really low. On a cheap flight, it can be negative, which means you cannot use your flight voucher at all. Other times, it can be $5 or so. I called customer service, they suggested picking a $300 flight rather than a $40 flight so I can use my voucher.  You have to pay extra fees. The vouchers didn't arrive by email, but we did get an email saying we were entitled to our vouchers. We had to call their number to speak to 3 people to have them issued. The guy on the phone had a horrible accent and it took us 40 minutes from phone up to phone down to get them. Their customer service phone number is impossible to navigate. This took us 2 hours to test each option. It's simply terrible.  This is the worst flight experience I have ever had.",-1

We’re supposed to depart at 4:10pm but on that day I got an email saying the flight time got pushed to 6:10. When we all finished boarding and sitting in the flight, they announced that they were facing technical problem and the flight would be delayed again. After waiting more than an hour in the flight, they made us to get out the flight explaining that we can’t flight. While we were hanging around the gate, they announced that they delayed the flight to 9:15pm, so we waited till then. Around 8:50pm, they cancelled the flight after having made us wait for about three hours. They explained they either rebook or refund the ticket, so I went to ticket counter but they said the earliest flight is tomorrow morning. They didn’t even provide us any place to stay and my schedule is all screwed up.",-1

We understand that we had to be re routed to Alabama for gas due to not being able to land during a storm in Atlanta. The pilot explains we will be refueled in 20 min. This took longer than an hour. The fasten seatbelts was on the entire time. Their was 2 men and one woman flight attendants. The two men were extremely rude. And explained that if the door was opened they were no longer working (so when they opened the door to refuel they no longer worked). Only the female and she was for 1st class. The men were on their phones and sleeping. You cannot make someone stay in a seat for 9 hours without a restroom break. This was supposed to be a 3.5 hour trip turned nightmare. And $45.00 for a 14 pound back pack is ridiculous. And a cookie and a sip of water does not make up for it. Terrible seats. Terrible customer service. They rather gossip than do what they are paid to do. Warning low fares equals teriible service, seating, and poor quality. I wont be flying with them ever again.",-1

I have family in the area where this plane came from and it was clear sky. The plane was filthy mess when we finally got into the plane and made it to my destination at 2am and not 8.43. I paid for a hotel that I barely got to even sleep in that night. Took the same flight a year ago and my plane was just cancelled with no reason. I had to pay for a hotel to stay by airport because I live 2 hours way. Then when I was flying home yesterday I added short cut security to my ticket and Orlando airport says they don’t honor for per check then what the heck did i pay money for? Then I’m on the phone took me 15 mins to just get past to a person and they said they will not refund the amount I paid. They were so unhelpful to boot I had to do it all over again today to be told I have to Email. 10 minutes and a lot of demanding i speak to a women who put me in Hold for an extended time and refunded my money but what a hassle - mI will pay for any other airline but this one.

The 2nd flight from Florida to South Carolina departed ontime. Spirit offered me to fly to South Carolina 3 days later, and no other alternative. Woman who worked for Spirit at desk told me she couldn't refund me, and if I call customer service they may be able to. I called customer service and spoke to 2 different people. Offered no refund of the ticket from Florida to South Carolina. Which if they did I would not feel the need to go out of my way to tell everyone how terrible of a company they are....

After making my flight to Orlando I was of course trying to catch my plane back to Hartford. For some reason Spirit decided to cancel this trip and never notify me. So, at 630am today I jad to wait for all of these wonderful employees to figure out why. They finally tell me I never boarded from Hartford so that's why it cancelled. Well, how did I happen to make it to Orlando to catch my return flight then? So, they correct it but it took so long I wasn't able to board. They then put me on the next flight. 4pm! Almost 12hrs later. So, after waiting this amount of time, 15 minutes after we're supposed to board they inform us that the plane was now delayed another 2 hours in Atlanta. My conciliation prize you ask? $50 towards a future hassle through their airline and $14 whole bucks to buy what at an airport?

I had no sleep from the previous night yet they made me not go on the flight. They told me that I had to pay the 65 dollars upfront or I will not be able to go on my plane very rudely ignoring my questions and the supervisor made me feel super uncomfortable.

2018-07-26,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Atlantic City via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Horrible experience,True,"  2 full days wasted time in airports and never made it to destination. Booked the flight originally from Atlanta (ATL) to Atlantic City paying full fare. 3 delays throughout the day and the flight was ultimately cancelled. Airline cited ""weather related"" despite the destination having no issues. Apparently air traffic was busy landing other airlines in the area and Spirit did not have priority. The next day same time flight was immediately overbooked and the gate agents suggested a flight 2 days later or fly to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) for a 3 hour layover and catch that flight into ACY. While in the air to FLL, Spirit cancelled the flight to ACY with no options to fly into the vicinity. Given the option to fly back to ATL that same day on standby, or wait 11 hours and catch the night flight to ATL, or spend the night in FLL and try again 2 days later. According to Spirit app, Spirit airplanes were flying in and out of ACY but not from ATL or FLL. I was able to standby the last 2 seats to ATL and immediately went to ticket agent to arrange for a full refund as Spirit could not even get us there until at least 72 hours past the original flight. I was informed by the supervisor the ""they could not offer a refund as I had flown to FLL and back to ATL"". Ridiculous. We never made it to the destination. They said ""finance dept would be in touch with me within 5-7 business days to determine if they could offer me a refund"". Despite pointing out the fact that I wasted 2 full days and did not make it to the destination, it fell on deaf ears. This airlines is inept, unorganized and are obviously at the bottom of the air traffic controllers totem pole. This airline is not able to offer alternative options.

This airline has so many fees that it ends up costing much much more than other airlines. 50lbs is the norm for baggage weight limit across every other airline I’ve ever flown. I had a bag that weighed 49lbs and I was told at the gate that I needed to remove 9lbs or pay another $30. Not only did I not have another bag, if I would have, Spirit would have charged me $46+ for a carry-on, something no other airline I’ve encountered has ever done.

I would highly recommend you avoid them at all cost. Speaking of cost, they come across as saying they have low cost for their tickets which they do however what they don’t tell you is how they nickel and dime you to death. I had to pay $42 to check my bag, the only other option was to pay $45 to carry on my bag. I am very used to flying with Delta and get free checked bags. The customer service was awful, very rude. When I got on the plane I was sandwiched in between two people that were not large people, and basically could not move my entire flight. They came through with a drink cart and the only way you could get a beverage or a snack is by paying for it. I guess you get what you pay for, I will go back to only flying Delta.",-1

(hey sent me an email almost an hour after the flight left letting me know the gate had changed) We had been sitting near the gate for a half hour and people were in line but not boarding. We found out by walking around that they changed to another gate and left. They announced it over the PA system, which one could not understand given the acoustics of O'Hare's L wing (low ceiling, all hard surfaces) and the number of people in that area. They would not let us on after closing the door, though the plane was still docked at the gate. I was directed to customer service. Then was told to wait for a supervisor. The flight left while waiting for the supervisor. I never saw a supervisor. Instead, we found a flight 12 hours later with another airline. Why I gave a 2 instead of a 0: One attendant who was on his way to work another flight went to the gate employee and asked about our situation. This did not get us the results we wanted, but I sure appreciate his kindness. With all ground employees, we had a frustrating experience, receiving the run-around and pat, impersonal answers.",-1

I was in a group of 10 people, half the group flew United and got home to NJ on their original day of travel. Some had short delays due to cloudy weather in NJ but the rest of the group who flew on Spirit has been sent around to different airlines from state to state with 6 delays and 2 cancellations so far.

2018-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1.0,the worst airline ever,True,  My flight was from Detroit to Orlando. First they said it was a delay because of the aircraft it have already been 2 hr delay and I asked for a voucher they said they was not giving out any. Then hour later they said they are canceling the flight because of the weather going to Orlando. Well guess what there where other airlines still flying out to Orlando this airline was the only one Canceling flights. Then only had one person trying to rebooked over 200 people flights I stood in line for three hours trying to get a flight than they said we doing have a flight going out until 3 days later. They was not offering a hotel or anything for the customer Inconvenience. This is the worst airline ever.  I had to spend the night at the airport and pay extra 400$ to fly out the next with a different airline.,-1
2018-07-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never ever again,True,"  Kansas City to Los Angeles. Never, ever, ever again Spirit Airlines. Today is my first time flying with you and you wrecked it before I even got on the plane. $174 in baggage fees (one carry on for my laptop and one checked bag). I found a purse that will hold my laptop, called to cancel the carry-on, and was told you plan to keep that money whether I bring a bag or not. Passengers be warned! If you don't use the bag, they keep your money anyway. $80 for a bag I won't have with me today. A friend booked our flights, they can't send each of us a confirmation, I called with a question and they changed the notification email to mine. Then they sent her credit card rejection to me. Yes, they ignored her right to privacy about the transaction and wanted me to call her and tell her there was a problem with her credit card even though her phone number was on the reservation. Oh and they want us to pay extra if we want to sit together on the flight. Never again. After all the additional fees, I could have flown a real airline with drinks and snacks and a free carry-on bag. So much for, ""You only pay for what you use!"" I'm paying $80 for a bag that I am not using. Never ever again.",-1

I bought 3 tickets really low but ended up paying more than a regular tickets would have cost me to fly from Oakland to Las Vegas with all the fees they added. I paid an additional $184 dollars in luggage fees, and then an additional $58 in seat assignment fees. They have all kinds of outrageous fees to offset their low tickets price and that's how customers get fooled. Its not worth it, its really not worth it. Do not fall into their low tickets price trap. On top of that you have to purchase everything onboard even water and snacks. Most airliners provide these services free of charge. My experience was a nightmare. They even lost my luggage coming back and I had to wait an hour for them to locate them. Do not fly with this airline.",-1

While, Spirit on the surface, seemed like a good choice, it was just that, on the surface. My husband and I decided to go on a last minute honeymoon to Las Vegas. While, our flights were reasonable I was horrified at the cost of luggage. Fine, we decided to just check one bag, and avoid the carry on totally to cut down the price. The scale at Spirit said ""53 pounds"". We were hit with an additional fee of $55.00. We could have checked another entire bag for less than the overage fee. While I was upset, hey if its overweight, its overweight. Same items in the same bag just a few days later, we return home on American and wouldn't you know my bag was 9 pounds lighter only ""43 pounds"" I don't have words for how mad I was. Granted, we still would have be subjected to an overage fee through Spirits 40 pound limit, but it would have been $20 cheaper. All scales differ, but I am not buying a 9 pound difference on domestic flights. No drinks served on the plane, no nothing for a 3 hr plane ride. All together we paid well over $300, for totally nothing. Never again Spirit, never again. I'll book more in advance & fly Southwest since they care about their customers.",-1

I had read many horrible reviews about Spirit Airlines and never took them seriously until I experienced them myself. They cancelled a flight last minute and when I begged them to provide me with an alternative flight (that wasn't 24 hours later like they suggested) or asked for them to pay for a hotel room, or give some sort of accommodation, they cancelled my flight without my permission due to ""inappropriate behavior"". What was inappropriate here? Me asking them to be human and not have me sleep at the airport for the next 24 hours? Mind you, other flights were still flying that night and keeping their route. Trust me, pay that extra $50 with another airline because their customer service is not worth the headache.",-1

I have been traveling for 20 years. The last 3 times with Spirit I’ve had no problems. In fact, they’ve been great and I’ve recommended to several friends. Tonight will be my last time flying with this airline. I've never had to check a bag before, and I make it a point not to, but because the flight was getting full, they pulled the last 20 people out of line and made them all pay for bags. They were not checked and if they needed to be, they would have slapped a tag on it and taken below. I find it extremely irritating seeing as though I’ve never had to check a bag with Spirit and they pull this. Last time. Can’t wait to get home. $200 unneccesarily spent. And it’s so funny how only the last 20 people were made to pay for bags. Good bye Spirit. No more recommendations from me.",-1

",False,"  Columbus to Las Vegas. Extremely disappointing experience. I had read that Spirit was attempting to work on bettering their public image so I thought I would give them a chance on a short flight. Booking was fast and simple, plus extremely affordable. But then the day of my flight I got a 2 hour notice, my simple 4 hour flight had just been cancelled. And no available replacement flights for 24 hours. So you get what you pay for, and in this situation I paid for a 4 hour flight to take up 28 hours of my time. I will never fly this airline again.",-1

Then they changed it to have a connector in Las Vegas. Both ways. Our flight now got in so late we had to get a hotel room at the airport. We paid for the larger seats and they did not book us in them until I called and asked and they made it sound like they were doing me a favor by giving them to me for the extra flight we weren't supposed to be on. Every step of the way our flights were delayed and we were late. When I went up to the counter at our departing flight, they wanted to charge us $10 per boarding pass when we didn't use the machine.

This is my 3 rd this with Spirit in the last month. Each of the flights were delayed by at least 3-4 hours. You find out about the delay when you get at the airport. Will never fly Spirit again, completely unreliable and disrespectful of the customers time. They have everyone email address, I suggest that when they know about the delays, should be posted before the customers leave their houses.

First to find their exact prices on the luggage wasn't clear on their website, I saw some people shocked at the check-in assuming the weight was the same as other airlines. They nickle and dime for everything I was surprised the restroom was free, cramped, sitting I hardly had room to put my purse under the seat, the stroller for my lap baby wasn't available at my international destination so I had to hold my granddaughter while standing in a long line at custom, I'm a disabled vet so this was very painful.

If you're looking for a value of airfare these days, there's no such thing anymore. But most definitely, look elsewhere than Spirit. Spirit's motto is to nickle and dime you for everything. They've taken away the included carryon, which every other major airline offers. And their overweight checked baggage starts at 40lbs rather than 50lbs like every other major airlines. So you might as well fly the next cheapest airline because your out of pocket cost will most likely be the same, if not better, and you'll receive better service.",-1

We booked Spirit knowing they were a budget airline. We didn’t want or need any extra accommodations, we thought. But even asking for water for my three and four year old was $3 and you can’t pay cash. Some poor man had to ask other people on the flight to pay for him something to drink because he only had cash. When we showed up right on time for our flight, they informed us the plane had left early even though on their system, we were clearly there and checked in. They made us wait in a freezing airport with two small kids, for 9 hours. All while looking at the delta flight across from us all snuggled up with free blankets and pillows while they waited. It was miserable. When we finally arrived to where we were going, after being awake for 24 hours, nobody was at the lost and early luggage stand for over an hour. We waited and called everywhere possible. All the other airlines had people at their stands except ours. We finally saw one woman with Spirit come down. We asked her if she could help. She mumbled at us, and said “I’m not doing that. There’s someone else who will but he’s busy right now. You see there? He’ll come down there just like I did, bye.” And stormed off. All I wanted was my children’s car seats so we could go home.",-1

We run to the new gate only to see it is closed. Talk to customer service and they basically say, sorry not sorry, it is your responsibility to make sure you are at the correct gate. After I heard this the same airline announce gate changes for 4 of their other flights. Talked to a supervisor, she said there was nothing we can do.

They adviced me to check bags online for lower rates than at the airport. The email I got from spirit only had. Check In option. So instead of clicking that I manually went online to their website and check bags. Their website kept saying wrong email address. Or wrong confirmation code. This was 7pm. My flight was at 11 the next day. I got frustrated after trying 9 times. I gave up went to that email and clicked check in. I ended up paying double the fees at the airport. I thought I would take it up with customer service once I landed. Oh well you can forget about that there was a guy would not speak English he was not understanding at all what I was trying to say I asked for someone who spoke English, frustrated again that he was not clear on what my issue was. He kept saying sorry for getting charged twice! When a supervisor came on, she interrogated me - How did you put in the code? I typed it. What did you put in as cnfm code? I said it her memorized! Are you sure you didn’t write 1 instead if i ?? Ma’am I promise you I can read and write. I’m doing it right now and it seems to be working just fine. Couldn’t be possible that it wasn’t working last night and it’s working now? A glitch perhaps? Just because it’s working now does not prove that it acted up last night. Her final comment was if we find out that the site was having some issues we’ll contact you. That was it! Already the “number 1 and i“ comment had put such bad taste in my mouth and all I was asking for is to help me out with my return baggage since I’d paid double already.",-1

The Carry on size 18x14x8 and my just the right size accepted the wheel, they wouldn't do any thing like this little thing, all they would do is make you pay.

2018-07-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,refuse to take responsibility,True,"  Orlando to Las Vegas. The issue was with my online bags purchase. The money was deducted from my debit card, but did not go through via the webiste, so I called for assistance. I was told by the first agent that I had to call my bank, that the error was on their end, even though the payment showed in my account as approved, he kept telling me it had been declined. So I called my bank, which took roughly 20 minutes to get a live rep, and they told me that there was no issue w/ my card, that the payment was valid, and that I needed to call the airline back and guaranteed me that the transaction number they provided me would be all it took for agents to resolve the issue. The next agent I got from Spirit refused to try the transaction number, repeatedly telling me that the bank was wrong despite I just got off the phone with them. She repeatedly told me to be quiet and listen to her no matter how often I repeated that my bank had told me there was no issue with the card. She repeatedly refused to let me speak to a supervisor until I became extremely angry. Then I was put on hold for a long period until someone claiming to be a supervisor took my call. She proceeded to refuse to try the transaction number my bank had given me, but tried to run my card a 2nd time, which resulted in a 2nd error with my card. I had to call my bank back again to get them to return the funds to my account, transfer them to another account/card, and then repeat the full transaction. In total I was on the phone with your agents and my bank over an hour, for what should have been a 5 minute call. They refuse to take responsibility for their error, were rude on the phone, incompetent, and unwilling to try to resolve the issue.",-1

2018-07-03,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Minneapolis,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3.0,I will fly with Spirit again,True,"  I flew Spirit airline from Baltimore to Minneapolis this weekend. Needed a cheap flight to drop off my son to visit some friends he has not seen in a while. While my main attraction was cheap, I did find this flight better than some higher fare flights I have taken in the past. Flight attendants were friendly, overall a pretty good experience. I was really happy that I could fly out and back in the same day. Again cheap- didn't want to pay for a hotel room. The site did tell me when I booked that the return flight usually runs 1/2 late. Which ended up being true, but I was prepared because of the notice when choosing the flight. So kudos for doing that, it was helpful. One recommendation for Spirit is give an option for booking one passenger a round trip and another passenger on the same booking as a one way. As I had difficulty booking my son so he wasn't showing as an unaccompanied minor -which is extra$$$ The only way around it to book everything as one way and if you have a connection you might end up with a problem if the airline runs late. One other comment..... the seat behind us the tray was broken and would not stay locked, so the attendant called for maintenance to ""fix"" it before we took off. All he did was tape it up, it looked bad even for bare fare - I have a picture of it, he didn't even do a good tape job. Unfortunately the person could not use the tray at all because of it. I think your maintenance needs to be a little more creative making the best of the situation for the passengers. Even though it is bare fare we the passengers did choose to spend our dollars on your product. And that is the reason for a 3 star. All in All I will fly with Spirit again.",1

My first flight got delayed for an unknown reason and when on the plane it got delayed again because they needed to find a seat for someone. I landed at FT Lauderdale at around 7:30 and my next flight started to board at 7:40. I was with a group of about 12 people who were all trying to Dallas. Since we were entering the U.S. from a different country, we needed to go through customs and Re-check our bags. We asked the attendees if they could alert the next flight that there was a delay and that more than 12 people would be arriving late but they just said that we would make it through. After going through customs, we waited for our bags to arrive, we waited and waited and ended up missing the flight because of that. We then talked to one of the Spirit agents at there customer service center who then told us it was not Spirit’s fualt that the plane was delayed and that we would have to wait two days to get to our destination and that they would not pay for a hotel. This is crazy, I’m a minor and they couldn’t even get me a hotel room. The lady told me she had to get something and when she came back, she had a phone and charger and plugged it in the wall, what a joke. I had to sleep at the airport last night and booked an American flight. Spirit is an airline you do not want to fly with.",-1

2018-06-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,disregard for the consumer,False,"  Atlanta to Detroit. We booked a flight for my son with Spirit to come home to visit his family and friends. It was due to depart Atlanta at 4:21 to arrive in Detroit at 6:22. My son had to make a two hour drive to Atlanta and provided himself with the standard two hour window to make his flight. After parking in a prepaid parking lot and taking the shuttle to the airport, we received an email from Spirit that his flight had been cancelled. We received this email at 1:57; less than two and a half hours before his scheduled departure. He was instructed to check in upon his arrival at the airport. He went immediately to the counter and all they would offer him was either a refund or they would reschedule him on another flight...two days later!! When I personally called, I was told there was nothing they could do. They cannot control the weather. I am a commercial pilot, so I checked the radar for the time of the originally scheduled flight. There was absolutely NO weather issues that would have prevented this flight from continuing. My son was left stranded, two hours from his home and thirteen and a half hours from his final destination. He is now missing out on two days of his visit since he is now driving through the night just to get here. We are more than disappointed at Spirit's disregard for the consumer. We will never fly Spirit again and intend to share our disgust with everyone we know. We even have a Spirit credit card that we were using to earn miles to fly with Spirit in the future. This card will also be cancelled. It is absolutely unbelievable to me that Spirit can just up and cancel a flight leaving all those people who paid good money for that flight high and dry. Beware of this airline. They clearly have no regard for the very same people who keep them in business. On another note, Spot Hero was fantastic. They gave us a full refund for our prepaid parking. Also, for our ""inconvenience"" (casued by Spirit) they gave us a credit on our account for future parking.",-1

Lost my bag, was told at the airport that the bag will be delivered to me once it was found. The bag was traced the next day and the company called me to come and collect it from the airport. I live miles away from the airport and work long hours during the week. Wrote to the company and was given a number which nobody answers. Saving a few dollars is NOT worth the agony!

Please do no take this airline if you do not absolutely have to. They have the worse customer service of all airlines. First they held on the plane without explanation for 20 minutes upon landing.  We arrived at our gate 10 minutes before the flight while the plane was still visibly on the ground and were not allowed on the flight. They did nothing to accommodate us. The flight remained on the ground another 10 minutes and we were still not allowed to board. Other airlines delayed departure because they were aware of the mishap yet spirit felt they had to be on time for once.  I will never be buying another flight from them,-1

Flight we were on was late 2 hours departing for issues - one being they over fueled the other plane A/C went out then flight was late additional 2 hours after another plane in our gate was also late departing. Would likely not fly with them again unless it is my only option. Other then the ground staff at Ft Lauderdale, the cabin staff was professional along with boarding staff.",-1

Spirit Airlines cancelled my flight home on the day of the trip. Contacted 4 different representatives and was given 3 options: a later flight that was 3 days later, a full refund, or a travel voucher of the same amount. Ended up booking another airline paying extra for our family of four, 2 days of hotels in Seattle, 2 days of lost work, 2 days of other travel related expenses in Seattle and an enormous amount of frustration trying to figure out unexpected changes at the last minute. Spirit refused to reimburse any of the above extra cost. Will never use the airline.",-1

We had a layover in Detroit so because we were delayed we had to stay 24 hours in Detroit until the next available flight. They gave us a hotel coupon but we still had to pay $60 for a horrendous motel with carpet stains, weird oversized 1980s furniture, shower that made a screaming sound, next to nowhere. The flight back was also delayed and to top it off they lost my notebook I left on the plane. Don’t fly this airline, the money you save isn’t worth the pain.",-1
2018-06-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Hartford,,,,,,1.0,1.0,they would not issue refunds,True,"  Orlando to Hartford. I booked the flight and selected as instructed that I was bringing a personal item and carry on bag. When I pulled up my boarding pass I was hit with $81.00 which the ""check-in agent"" agreed was not right. She tracked down her boss and subsequent returned to inform me that it could not be credited.  I got to gate 34 in B Terminal and learned that the flight was being delayed due to weather in Dallas where the plane was coming from. Two subsequent delay announcements from the gate agent indicated that the plane was being worked on by maintenance and we would be able to board at 6:38pm. Several more delays were announced and the gate was changed from 34 to 31 at approximately 8:00 pm and the we were told that the plane would depart at 10:25pm and arrive in Hartford @ 1:06am. At approximately 8:45 Spirit announced that the flight was delayed until 8:25 am on Monday morning. Several people went ballistic and security was called in and the passengers were calmed down. Spirit informed us that due to it being weather they would not issue refunds.",-1
2018-06-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Dallas,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,mad about the baggage up-charge,True,"  Pittsburgh to Dallas. While most airlines allow one carry-on (stowed in the overhead bin) and one personal item per passenger, for free, Spirit only allows one personal item per passenger, no regular carry-on. Similar to Basic Economy. Spirit Airlines charges $55 per bag for carry-on (limit one per passenger) or $52 per checked bag. We had planned on each having one carry-on and one personal item, and at the time we booked the tickets, it was not at all obvious that the carry-on would incur a charge. The first clue came during online check-in, when there was a question about how many carry-on bags we would have. I looked up the baggage policy on the Spirit Airlines website--it said limit one carry-on and one personal item per person, but did NOT mention the charge! We did not find out about the up-charge until we got to the airport, and I asked a gate agent. Maybe I looked in the wrong place on the website, but this policy of charging for a single carry-on should be made more obvious, since it is not standard among airlines. Note: our tickets were not  basic economy, they were normal economy tickets. Furthermore, $52 for a checked bag is exorbitant - American Airlines charges $25. Spirit Airlines takes advantage of customers who do not know their bizarre baggage policy, up-charging them once they've already booked tickets and arrived at the airport. This policy amounts to falsely advertising a low price, when the real price of travel is $52-$55 dollars higher than listed. If we had missed the baggage charge information at the ticketing counter, and paid at the gate, carry-on charges would have been $65. On the flight: no wifi, and they charge for drinks and snacks ($3 for soft drinks, juices, or water--normally free on other airlines). Tray tables are about one third the size of normal tray tables; seat back pockets are a series of straps that barely hold the safety information. No barf bags. Skimping on tray tables and seat back pockets would not normally irritate me, but I'm still mad about the baggage up-charge. Charging for beverages added insult to injury (we did not purchase beverages, since we had luckily purchased a bottle of juice at the airport). No issues with airline employees, staff on the plane and at the ticketing counter were polite. The flight was smooth (luckily, since barf bags were not available). Unless you are only flying over night, and don't need anything more than a personal item, I do not recommend booking Spirit Airlines tickets unless they are at least $52 dollars cheaper than the alternative. Even then, I would hesitate, because now I have a grudge against Spirit Airlines and don't want to give them any more money.",-1
2018-06-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Atlanta,2.0,,4.0,,,4.0,1.0,good if you have no bags,True,"  Baltimore to Atlanta. While the attendants and crew were all fine (even a sense of humor), the pricing is only good if you have no bags. My flight was $71, a good price, I thought. My one checked bag - one, not anything outrageously large or heavy, either - was $52, almost doubling my total cost. Southwest Airlines has honest pricing, with free bag check for up to two bags. Guess I will stick with them. And I knew, btw, that there was a baggage fee, but since most airlines charge a more reasonable $25 per bag, I never expected this. Just raise the base airfare and be more honest about your actual pricing. And, it didn't matter to me, but they charge highway robbery rates for any food or drink in flight. Fortunately, I didn't need anything.",-1
2018-06-26,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Detroit,3.0,,4.0,,,4.0,5.0,Our experience was fine,True,"  Myrtle Beach to Detroit. Spirit gets poor reviews quite often it seems. My review is different. Our experience was fine. We were treated politely, we were on time on both flights and we saw flight attendants going out of their way to make people comfortable and happy. For the most part our fellow travelers behaved well too. There's always the complainers and people who cannot control their children. Don't complain because you don't fit into seat or get First Class treats. We will continue to fly Spirit for its prices and convenience not because of any ""so-called"" perks.",1

Coming home from a month away serving at a summer camp, I was more than ready to go home! My first issue with this airline was when I arrived, I had been thinking that I had already paid for my luggage the entire time, but turns out my payment “never went through”. Then my connecting flight to Minneapolis was delayed due to bad weather, which I know the airline cannot control, but this delay caused me to miss the only flight to Atlanta that night and until I went up to the desk for the third time the Spirit Airlines employees did the absolute minimum to help me get on the soonest flight out. The only flight they were able to get me was a connecting flight to Boston the following morning at 7am. I will never use this airline again. And I was also only offered a coupon for low price hotel rooms, and I was told that I would be getting a food voucher but I was never given one.",-1

I flew from Boston to Cancún, it wasn’t the best plane ever, they don’t even give you a drink of water but whatever, wasn’t a big deal! The staff seemed to hate their job, rude and very bothered. My flight stopped in Myrtle beach and because it was the same flight that was gonna take me to the final destination we didn’t have to get off the plane. The staff was all sitting down on their phones or talking when we stopped to Myrtle beach, of course they deserved a break. I wanted a water so I asked one of the staff members if I could buy it there or if I needed to go out to the airport and get it (first time flying with them). One of the staff rolled her eyes and asked you wanted it now, while scrolling on her phone. I said no I can wait until later. It took her 40 mins to bring it. That was ok, I said I’ll wait.  Anyways, coming back was hell. We came from Cancun to Florida to Boston. The plane landed late, and they made us wait 20 min in the plane because the airport was too full! I don’t know who’s fault that is but why schedule so many planes to land at once ? Going through immigration was hell, I only had 20 min to make it to my flight, I ran, I begged, I cut through and there was hope until they tell us that we still have to get our luggage and check it in again - okay I’m running like crazy with my heavy luggage and they won’t check it in beside there was 5 min till the plane left. I don’t know their rules but there’s been times when flights get delayd for 10-20 min and it’s no big deal. I talked to a lot of people on the line who were on the same boat as me, so why leave when 1/2 of your passengers are missing? Long story short I missed my flight. I go to customer service and I ask the lady when the next flight is, she says 12 hrs later. I’m like “what, 12 hours later?” I was obviously upset but not even once was I rude to anyone. I said no I’m not trying to fight I’m obviously upset because have to wait 12 hrs and miss work for a flight I missed because of you guys. I asked her if there was anything she could do? She went to check with her manager and said to me that they can’t do anything because it wasn’t their fault! They said the only thing they could do was give me a coupon for a hotel. Which didn’t work. Everyone on that line at that time and 3 hrs later when I came back (from checking with other airlines ) was having the same issue.",-1
2018-06-25,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,3.0,wouldn’t suggest this airline,False,"  This airline may be the cheapest but I’m a firm believer that you get what you pay for. First of all, you have to pay $84 round trip for one checked bag less than 40 lbs (if it weighs more, you have another fee) and you are only able to bring a small personal item on board for free. You also have to pay to pick your seat for each flight or they just place you in whatever is left. The seats on the flight are extremely uncomfortable and do not recline at all,  they do not have any complimentary beverages or snacks. You must pay for everything on the flight. I wouldn’t suggest this airline.",-1

However, every single person checking us in and including the flight attendant were rude! No smiles, no help. Just do this, do that. I was treated better in bootcamp then any of your crew. The baggage weight is too low and cost too much for just 2 pounds over. I tried several times to access my flight information on the web page and to get prior information but this is as good as the customer service. I would suggest fixing the whole thing. To say the least I will not be using this airline again. I did see a sign on the plane saying Spirit were proud of being the youngest crew in the fleet. If that's the reason staff are horrible then may I suggest employing a older crowd!",-1

Then when we land, we sit there for another 30 minutes. I traveled with about 10 other women who are traveling home all up and down the east coast. There were 5 of them that missed their connecting flight. I am now sitting here in Ft Lauderdale waiting for my connection and we cannot begin to board until the flight attendants get here. Wow, this is just terrible. The total cost was the same as Southwest but they are way way way more better. I won’t be flying Spirit again.",-1
2018-06-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,simply not worth the hassle,True,"  La Guardia to Ft Lauderdale. I expected delays of a few hours. I expected to be charged exorbitant fees for my bag. I did not expect their attendant to be wrong about my flight being delayed 8 hours. As I came in to drop off my bag a waiting attendant asked me where I was flying to. After responding, they told me my flight was delayed until 11pm from 3:30. I confirmed with the attendant it was the 3:30 flight as I overheard another attendant telling a customer on the 11am flight the same thing and she assured me it was. As I am starting at a new job tomorrow morning and was worried this would get pushed into tomorrow I had to speak to an agent to see what could be done. The line to speak with an agent took 2 HOURS to get through. During that time I saw the only other flight out of LGA today that i could afford was down to 2 tickets left. I cant risk losing this new job so I booked the flight. I finally get up to the front desk only for them to tell me their attendant had been mistaken and it was only the 11am flight being delayed, mine was actually fine. Except I already booked the other flight at 3x the original cost of my spirit ticket as it was last minute. They were happy to issue me a refund voucher Of $40. I will never fly Spirit again. Its simply not worth the hassle. It's cheap but the incompetence at all levels is unacceptable.",-1

I arrived to my outgoing flight 75 minutes prior to departure and stood in line with little major movement. Finally someone asked me if I was flying to Cancun and I said yes. I cut to the front of the line where my bag was tagged ”late” and was told my luggage would not make it. Thankfully I found out the plane had. Mechanical issue and was almost 3 hours late. The return flight was great. We ended up being 25 minutes early.,1

Next available flight was about 30 hours later, putting me home 2 calendar days later than my original arrival. When I asked to reroute to Seattle that night they wanted to charge me the equivalent of a full price ticket to do so. Eventually I escalated the issue enough that they comped the destination change, but didn't assist with travel back to PDX. There goes $300 to Uber. To top it off - they forgot my bag in Las Vegas. It has since arrived in Seattle, but their courier won't drive it to me because we are ""too far"". Sorry for the inconvenience Spirit. Trust me, you won't have to worry about me again.",-1

Received a notice about 2 hours before departure about plane being delayed, and several times more till the plane was 6 1/2 hours late. They say it was mechanical issues however, they told us that they only could refund our ticket, rebook, or for us to wait till they cancelled the flight with no departures till the same time tomorrow. I understand issues happen but they never once sent a manager when we requested one and never offered us the option for rebooking with another airline at their cost when the plane kept being pushed back. They preferred to allow everyone wait in frustration and anger. I reviewed their policies and whoever wrote them did so in a way that the company would be able to keep profits at the cost of ""Not"" keeping customer service priority one. I chose Spirit because the price appeared to cost less than others; well, I guess you get what you pay for. My ticket cost 180$ one way and fortunately my carry on bag (only luggage) was small enough otherwise it would have cost an extra 50$",-1

Absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever had at an airport. We had to rebook the flight because we supposedly didn’t check in on time even though I checked in on my phone. The only item that is free is a purse. Almost $50 per carry on and $50 per checked bag. Check in and bag process is insane and highly unorganized. I will never fly this airline again!,-1

It is not worth it to save money for a 4 and 5 hours delay in flight. Not only that, their baggage rules are ridiculous in addition to their carry on. You save money through the ticket but not through baggage. Not comfortable. Not to mention the rude flight attendants and agents at gate. I just had a flight with them. It was delayed for 3 hours and it is not the first time. It is just not worth it. I would rather take another airline with 30$ or so price difference than actually go through this kind of hassle.

The seats were hard and made my back sore and the amount of usable space you had for laptops or eating was to small to be easily usable.

You would think an international flight is 50lbs limit, but nope, this airline has a limit of 40lbs, so when you show up you have to pay an extra $30/bag. What a rip off!

Flew with my family of 4 and it went way better than I thought it would. I have read so many horrible stories about Spirit.  I know that I had zero problems with Spirit. I had an angry 1 year old trying to sleep and the flight attendants were really nice. They went out of their way to help me. I've flown on other pricey airlines with the same situation, but the staff was not so great. Everyone says these cheap airlines are so horrible, but if you're not expecting to be pampered with free soda and little snacks, then you'll actually have a good experience. If you don't need luxury and you can manage to pack your own snacks and drinks, you'll be fine. Price was definitely worth it for me. And I added 2 checked bags each way. Still much cheaper than any other airline.",1
2018-06-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Florida,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,actually no cheaper,False,"  Spirit is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They booked us along with 15 other people on less than an hour layover to go through costums and security. We missed our flight, had to pay extra for parking, an extra night stay, and all missed work the next day because the next flight wasn’t until the next day. They then over booked the next days flight and several people were forced to stay back for another 12 hours. After all of this they took zero responsibility and no one was accommodated for. We respectfully asked them if there was anything they could do for us and they said they were not responsible for the missed flight but the airport was. The airport was amazing and gave us passes to get to the very front of all the lines and it still wasn’t enough. They also make you pay for the normal size of a free carry on bag, so their flights are actually no cheaper! Anyway, if you’re looking to book a trip... don’t ruin your trip by booking it with spirit! Seriously was one of the most frustrating experience of my life!",-1
2018-06-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,not creating value for customers,True,"  New York to Chicago. I had flown with Spirit five years ago and the terrible experience I had then, made me swear off this airline. But time did it's thing and dulled the memories. So I booked with Spirit again because the flight times seemed convenient. Little did I know that Spirit almost never flies on time. My husband's flight was delayed so much, the hotel cancelled his reservation, causing him immense trouble in the middle of the night. Same with me. Each way, my flight was delayed over 4 hours. As we sat at the gate wasting precious hours of our life, we wondered what were some things more probable than a Spirit Airline taking off on time- Lightning strikes? Winning the lotto? After the endless wait, when you finally are seated, the aircraft is usually the last in the line to take off, which means you sit in a cramped chamber for 45 mins with babies getting restless and crying their heads off because Spirit cannot take off on time. And of course, one must mention the stupid 'carry on' fee that Spirit charges. As an economist, who is very well aware of price-discrimination and how it wants to create an illusion of keeping the base fares low, let me call out their nonsense. They are not creating value for customers, except may be those fleeing home. Most people travel with a carry on bag and the act of having to pay for it makes Spirit suck big time, even if they keep base fares low. Read some behavioral economics, people. Finally, and this is small fry compared to the gigantic problems discussed above, but still I would like to point out that asking people to buy water and making the hosts push the peddling cart up and down the aisle like an ice-cream man on a winter afternoon- is just to so ridiculously wrong and lame. You can be a budget airline. But you can still maintain class, can't you? Do you have to show off your cheapness by having half a tray table and asking people to pay for water? I hope I do enough good in my life that I never have to fly with Spirit.",-1

We tried to do our check-in online the day before and we realized that we had to pay double of the price from any other airline companies, for checked baggage and carry-on! This was a shocker! The system won't let us do the check-in online the day before (the price for the checked baggage and carry-on were $10 cheaper) therefore we had to do it at the airport and we paid full price (over $100 for 2 piece of luggage). Unbelievable. Furthermore, the airline company doesn't even offer a glass of water on board. Everything needs to be purchased. I will never use Spirit Airlines for any of my trips. Flying to FL on Jet Blue was a different story, regular $25 for checked bag, free carry-on, comfortable seats and a choice of drinks with some snacks. Definitely no hidden fees with them. I will not recommend Spirit Airlines!",-1

I purchased airline tickets ahead of time for my travels to and from Chicago to visit my husband. When flying from Chicago to San Diego, they delayed my flight by 24 hours. I was emailed the change in departure time on my way to the airport, three hours prior to departure time. I had no where to stay during that time either, the Airbnb’s and hotels for same day were obviously expensive and when I asked the Spirit associate at the customer service desk if they could provide me with a voucher for a hotel, he gave me some pink slip and said you can call these places and see if they can discount your room for you. Obviously, I was already in disbelief. In addition, when I called, the representative said they had no where left to offer me. I slept at the airport. Two weeks later, as I had already bought tickets through Spirit to go to Vegas from Chicago, I arrived at the airport and again, the flight was delayed by two hours. The staff member explained that I would not make the connection flight in San Diego if I left two hours later. When I looked online later that day, that same flight that I could’ve got on had arrived one hour before my connection flight departed from San Diego. I could’ve made it. The staff member’s judgement was off. Then, Spirit sends two $50 vouchers to fly with them again, of which you are unable to use simultaneously according to their call center. This is clearly a tactic for you to continue purchasing tickers with their airlines. I trashed the vouchers. I do not want them. I would much prefer, and advise, you pay more for a better airline.",-1
2018-06-11,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,delayed by 3 hours,False,"  Worst airline for its ontime departure. Me amd my family just flew from Fort Lauderdale to Boston and we were delayed by 3 hours. We accepted it but on our way back from Boston, flight which was scheduled to fly at 11:46 am has not flown yet. They keep on changing the departure time. They will not accommodate their customer to another airline and next flight available cannot be accomodated either because its overbooked. A customer like me who fly a lot is better off by using any other budget airline than Spirit. I have always heard bad things about Spirit Airline but now I am a witness.",-1
2018-06-11,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Houston,3.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised,True,"  I was pleasantly surprised about my time on Spirit Airlines. It was a very inexpensive red eye from Seattle to Houston. Everything went so smoothly! Yes, you have to expect to pay for your luggage and less leg room - but it was worth the cheaper price. Everything was on time, we boarded quickly and the pilot was kind and funny!",1
2018-06-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Kansas City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst experience ever,True, Las Vegas to Kansas City. This airline is terrible! We had the worst experience ever with them! Coming home from Vegas and went to check in for flight and find out they cancelled our flight. We waited an hour for them to start calling us up! When we got up there she told us we should have an email. They rerouted us through Delta and we had to fly to Atlanta and have a 3 hour lay over and then fly back to KC! She also told us we would get refunded for any charges for the flight that got cancelled. I had purchased a checked bag (50$) and fast track check in (14$). Today I called to find out when my refund was coming and they informed me they could not refund my money! That I should of gotten the refund while I was there! Then proceeded to tell me the only thing I could do is go to Vegas and ask for my money back or file a complaint online! They basically stole 64$ of my money because of their own mistakes! I will never use this airline again!,-1

We had a 90 minute layover in Fort Lauderdale after returning from Cancun. The airplane that arrived in Fort Lauderdale we were held on for one hour “due to weather” even though it didn’t rain the whole day. Then we used my boyfriends military ID skipped all the lines for customs and still didn’t get to the flight. We then waited in line for four hours for them to tell us that they rescheduled our flight for the next day (16 hours later) with no accommodations for food, hotels, absolutely nothing. The staff were rude and disrespectful and couldn’t even accommodate an active military member who is now stuck trying to sleep in this airport with people from 3 other planes that this same thing happened to. I’d walk across the country before I ever go through them again. Absolutely pitiful.",-1

2018-06-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,terrible all the way around,True,  Phoenix to Dallas. I don't know how this company is still in business. Sat in the airport for 5hrs to find out the flight was cancelled due to bad weather. This company is so unprofessional that the employees were discussing how the plane was having mechanical problems. No hotel was provided and now I am currently trying to sleep on the Dallas airport floor to catch a flight in the morning through a Delta. I have only flown with Spirit once before this attempt and I can guarantee that Spirit will never received a dime from me again. Please do not waste money and try to fly with Spirit. Terrible all the way around.,-1
2018-06-08,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,caused nothing but grief,True,"  This airline has caused nothing but grief for my husband and I. We were so excited to be headed to Dominican Republic for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Our troubles and inconveniences were brought on by Spirit Airlines. Our flights keep getting delayed, we miss connecting flights and I was without my luggage for 3 days. Not to mention, 2 days of vacation were spent in the Santo Domingo airport. Now I am anxiously awaiting to get home to my kids, and our flight is once again delayed and I won’t be getting to Atlanta until 3am. I am so done with Spirit Airlines. They’re poorly managed and need to get it together if they want to stay in business.",-1

I’ll keep this short. 8 of us are going to a bachelor party in Miami, leaving from Baltimore. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 10:30am. It is now 5 pm and we are still at the airport waiting. We already missed a $300 fishing trip scheduled for today due to this delay, in addition to other things we had planned. At this point, our flight is schedule to leave at 8pm that makes 12 full hours we’ve been at this airport. I have never been a part of something so uncoordinated, unapologetic and unreasonable. We are canceling out return trip on Spirit (if we ever even make it to Miami). I would rather pay $800 for literally any other airline than fly Spirit. Never in my life have I encountered a company so unorganized and inexcusably incompetent. I will do everything in my power to ensure that no one I know will ever give business to this bush league airline. Thanks Spirit, for ruining the only bachelor party of this guy’s life!",-1
2018-06-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Baltimore,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,an absolute last resort,False,"  Atlanta to Baltimore. Heard warnings from friends to stay away from Spirit (delayed flights, unhelpful staff etc.) which were all rooted in reflective experience. Flight to Baltimore was delayed a total of 5 hours, 25hrs of which were spent on the plane. Flight back to ATL was moved up 45 minutes early, then upon my arrival at the gate was pushed back an hour, then an another, then another, which turned a scheduled 12:30 departure time into a now 4:30 departure time. Staff was entirely unhelpful, short and rude. Asked for just a cup of water while we waited in confusion and was directed to their menu, displaying a variety of overpriced drinks and snacks. Unimpressed. Spirit Airlines will serve as an absolute last resort for me, one I will avoid in the future if at all possible. You've been warned.",-1
2018-06-08,0.1,Business,First Class,FLL to LGA,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,methods of bait and switch,True,"  I have been a loyal customer of Spirit Airlines and that includes my family as well. I have heard horror stories pertaining to the management of this airline but until today, I did not want to participate in any negative reviews hoping that what others are complaining about would not happen to me. Unfortunately it did! On Sunday, June 3rd, at approximately 7 pm, I booked a flight from FLL to LGA. On Monday morning at approximately 9 am, my secretary brought to my attention that on the website, I clicked off a new feature added in a box where I am requesting a carry on and a checked bag for the total price of $81. Being within the 24 hour window that Spirit allows cancellations and modifications of errors, I called and asked for the support to correct this issue. They offered me $199 credit from the $219 charged. When I proceeded to book another flight, I saw only a credit of $109. I called back and spoke with another employee who assured me that within 24 to 48 hours, the credit originally offered will be granted after a phone review of my conversation is completed. 48 hours passed without getting the credit, I was told that I had to wait 72 hours for the phone review to take place. 72 hours went by and no full credit was issued. We are $9 club members, MC holders and loyal frequent flyers. The unorthodox methods of bait and switch used by this airline together with the rest of the inferior services offered to their passengers are good reasons to consider using an airline such as Jet Blue that may be charging slightly higher rates for their tickets but have an excellent customer service and loyalty track record. Shame on the Spirit management for implementing and allowing the use of this bait and switch method of doing business.",-1
2018-06-08,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Latrobe to Myrtle Beach,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,always had a pleasant experience,True,"  Latrobe to Myrtle Beach. I’ve flown with Spirit Airlines many times and I have always had a pleasant experience. The tickets are extremely cheap, and their staff is very professional. They do their best to help. One particular time, I was running late for my flight and they front loaded me through security so I could make it - it was greatly appreciated.",1
2018-06-07,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,unbelievable service,True,"  A recent experience flying with Spirit Airlines from Baltimore to Los Angeles for someone who moves around in other countries quite a bit left me dumbfounded. How can such an airline stay in business regardless of the low frill business model in the current age that we should be demanding more and expect more for our buck. Rude and not very well trained check in staff, including the supervisors. The check in operations at the Airport was very mediocre at best. 5 hours flight with no entertainment on board not even a wireless one that you could connect your own device. Hardly any leg room across standard seats. They charge fees for checked in luggage to include carry on hand luggage. Should we not be demanding more from our Airlines in terms of service, offering and features? Are we going back in time, depriving travelers of essential services to enrich shareholders and executives. I got to my destination and find out that one of my suitcases was missing still as of 4 days later. What an Airline, incompetence, lack of service, unbelievable service.",-1

From beginning to end, all dealings with Spirit Airlines was positive. All employees were friendly, efficient and professional. The pilots were skilled and the fight attendants were most pleasant. The planes were comfortable and quiet. Flights were not only on time but even arrived a little early. Baggage claims were efficient and reliable. Take your own snacks and you’re all set. I read some bad reviews but I can honestly recommend Spirit Airlines.",1
2018-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas via Detroit,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,The delay was horrible,True,  Orlando to Dallas via Detroit. Spirit is the worst airline to fly with. The delay was horrible. I was onboard and in the air when we had to detour back to Orlando international airport due to some crew / cabin problems. They were trying to give us a flight from Orlando to Detroit and wait till 8:30 to get on another flight to Dallas.,-1
2018-06-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ATL to SAN via DFW,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,customer service very unhelpful,True,"  Original flight was supposed to be Atlanta (departing at 12:45pm) to Houston and Houston to San Diego (arriving at 5:30pm). I was told my flight was delayed 1hour before departure. So I sat around the airport for 3 hours waiting on a plane. Which caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was told I had 3 options, wait for next flight (a day later) get Spirit credit back, or get refunded for the unused ticket. I had to work the next day and even if I could stay another day I have no where to stay and no means of transportation (I had already turned in my rental and checked out of my hotel). I asked the staff and called customer service all of which was very unhelpful. They refused to provide a hotel and refused to put me on a different airline. So after 2 hours of stressing out over how to get home. I found a Spirit flight to LAX instead of my original destination of SAN. Atlanta to Tampa to Los Angeles. The flight didn’t land in LAX until 12AM. I then had to rent a car ($155) and drive two hours to San Diego. I didn’t get home until 3AM.",-1
2018-06-07,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Denver,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,I think Spirit can do better,False,"  This is my second Spirit Airlines flight that has been delayed in the last week. The first was a weather delay and probably unavoidable. The second was due to an issue with a flight attendant. This delay was an immediate hour delay, which is frustrating. You didnt know you were going to be an hour late before everyone arrived to board? I'm mostly frustrated with the communication. I inconvenienced my family by a really early wake up only to find that the flight was significantly delayed. I think Spirit can do better.",1

I would say you get what you pay for considering Spirits “cheap” flights however not really because its just as much as the main lines after you pay an arm and a leg for even just a small carry on. 3$ for water (but ice is free!) And in addition, there’s less amenities on spirit than other flights and I feel I've been jipped of my money. Definitely won't fly with Spirit again.",-1
2018-06-07,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,3.0,about $176 to rebook my ticket,True,"  Richmond to Ft Lauderdale. I decided to purchase cheap tickets from Spirit Airlines b/c it seemed to be like a great deal (at the time) to get me from point A to point B. My first ticket from San Diego to DC had to be cancelled due to a court appearance. When I called them to explain, they told me that I would cost me about $176 to rebook my ticket. However, I could cancel it for $100. After the cancellation, of a $230 ticket, they ended up refunding me only $60 in airline credit. Less than a week later, I ended up purchasing 2 one-way tickets from my mom to pick up my Nephew. I had booked it thru Cheaptickets.com which has a 24 hour cancellation policy. I mistakenly purchase my mom return ticket on the same date as her departure, when I called to cancel this, Cheaptickets advised me that for Spirit Airlines the issue had to be dealt with them directly. Call Spirit Airlines and while I am on the phone, there is a message that says ""you can make changes to your reservation online or via the app."" Go to the app and I make those changes. Surprisingly with a $1.00 plus refund. I make a screen shot of this just in case. Go on with my day. Two days later, I tried to pull out the itinerary, and it keeps showing me the original itinerary from 06/19 instead of 06/23. I called Spirit Airlines who were not able to locate the change and told me that there is no option to make changes thru the app (apparently she was not familiar with the app and its features). I asked to provide me her email to send her the screen shots with the changes, she provided me with a website to go thru (which makes me wonder how that is going to help me if their app is the one that got me in this mess in the first place). Then, transferred me to floor manager who attempted to assist me by looking into my credit card, name of the passengers, etc. but at the end was not able to assist me as well. At the end. I lost about $500 in less than a week, rebooking for my flight from San Diego to DC, and now purchasing new tickets from VA to FL for my mom and nephew (tickets turned out to be non- refundable?).  I realized $30 to $50 dollar difference is nothing compared to the peace of mind other established airlines provide you with, on top of the fact that you can take a decent size carry-on and they provide you with soft drinks during their flights.",-1

My party of nine checked in with plenty of time at the Spirit Terminal at Bradley Airport in Hartford, CT. As we only eat kosher, we were finishing up our kosher pizza (purchased out of the airport as there are no kosher stands there) as we were walking over to security etc. We then headed over to security and got to the gate with 25 minutes to take off. They closed the gate and claimed we were eating pizza and dawdling. We were not  doing any of those things. We had 5 kids with us and twin one year olds. We left ourselves plenty of time. they saw we checked in more than 3 hours to flight time. They saw we were going thru security as it is a tiny  airport, they did not call us, help us, make final boarding calls. They saw security took a little longer because of our party size. We got to the gate with 25 minutes till take off and they didn't care. They didn't even want to speak to us.",-1

Don’t fly this airline!",-1
2018-06-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1.0,not even get a chance to fly,False,"  Did not even get a chance to fly this terrible airline. I had booked a weekend trip to Vegas and the arrival and departure times were reasonable. After I'd booked to fly from Kansas City to Las Vegas, Spirit Airlines changed the times to give me two red eye flights. Completely unacceptable. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.

2018-06-04,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Ann Arbor,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,4.0,"under 4 hours, Spirit is perfect",False,"  Orlando to Ann Arbor. This airline is great, it takes where you want to go safe and fast. The problem most people have is the legroom or no entertainment yet that is true, it’s very small. The legroom is one inch less. The entertainment was low but if you have a phone or Netflix, any type of entertainment, you will be fine. My flight was 2.5 hours, yet they got there 20 minutes earlier. If you are taking a very long exhausting flight Spirit might not be the best choice, but if your flight is under 4 hours, Spirit is perfect. A lot of people who set up reviews expected more for less. It is exactly what you get for it. Way cheaper and you get what you expect it’s great.",1
2018-06-04,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Las Vegas,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,my experience was fantastic,False,"  Oakland to Las Vegas.For all the horrible things I heard about Spirit my experience was fantastic. I was flying with my family, 2 adults, a 6 year old and a 16 month old. We had a really long layover from our first flight which was on a different airline so we had to get our bags and check back in to Spirit. The agents were very kind and allowed us to check our bags over 3 hours before our flight which is not their standard policy. The entire Spirit staff was friendly and went out of their way to ensure that we were okay traveling with children. Despite their charges for bags, seats etc. I would fly Spirit again.",1
2018-06-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Cabos to Dallas/Fort Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will not recommend or use again,True," Worst experience I've ever encountered with an airline. Leaving from Los Cabos to Dallas/Fort Worth. I arrive at the airport on time in Los Cabos only to find out my flight had been delayed about and hour. After boarding come to find out the aircraft was experiencing some problems (was told computer problem) and we boarded off the plane and taken back to the terminal, but was not given any time frame when the problem would be fixed or when we could board back on. Needless to say the problem was fixed shortly after we boarded off. Some of us boarded back on the plane but there were several passengers missing because they went to get something eat, and shopping to pass the time. Meanwhile passengers on the plan had to wait until all passengers were accounted for, since it was an international flight. All this took at least 3 1/2 hours, which I ended up missing my connecting flight which was leaving @ 2:03 to ATL. At no time were offered any complimentary/snack or something to drink for the inconvenience. When we arrived in Dallas, had to go through customs, try and re-check my bags and were given all types of mis-directions from people who worked there. Finally, get to Spirit ticket counter, had to speak with a manager to get me scheduled on another flight. This time through another airline which push me back some more. I didn't leave until 8:53pm. When I arrive in ATL @11:55 pm come to find out my baggage was not on the flight and was told it would be on another flight coming in around 1:30 AM. I will not recommend or use this airline again.",-1

We approached the Spirit Airlines counter for assistance an hour before our flight knowing we would not have time to check our bag and make it through security in time but there were no employees where there. When an employee did show up she informed us they could put us on the next flight Saturday morning at no cost. She walked away and never returned. The other airport employees told us that there were no more Spirit Airlines flights for the rest of the day and the desk was closed, there was no one we could talk to. We called Spirit Airlines to see if they could change the flight for us and they refused to offer any assistance. This airline had a bad reputation and I usually defend them as I travel frequently and always fly Spirit but the customer service was so terrible in this situation. My husband and I will never use this airline again. They lost two customers today.",-1
2018-06-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Portland via Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,terrible customer service,False,"  San Diego to Portland via Las Vegas. Worst flight experience ever. I took this flight to attend a family member's funeral. My baggage was left along with all my fellow travelers from San Diego because this airline was late arriving from another destination. I paid additional costs to even bring my luggage on the flight. We waited while everyone else received their bags to only find out later our bags were not in Portland. In fact we would not have them returned till the following evening because this airline only flies into Portland during the evenings. However I am staying 3 hours leaving me without my bag till the following day. I will need to purchase clothing and hygiene products till my items arrive (2 days later). Not to mention i take medication and i do not have access to it. The airport staff were completely unsympathetic and non helpful. I was hung up on, told to call back three times because their system was updating, and given inaccurate information. I was then provided the San Diego baggage number and told that department was open when in fact they do not open for another 4 hours. I chose this airline to save money because my trip was last minute. Unfortunately, one cannot plan for the death of loved ones in advance. This trip will end up costing me far more than if I would have stayed with a reputable airline. My circumstances for going on this trip were stressful enough and now thanks to this unprofessional, uncaring, and incredibly terrible customer service experience it is even more so. I can even get ahold of any personal to help me and problem solve. I do not recall a worse trip.",-1

I have been met with such terrible service at a gate and on the flight as well. I will never be flying with Spirit Airlines ever again. Not only that, a flight might be cheap but expect to also pay $63 to put you bag in overhead storage. For a $300 ticket, the seats didn’t recline, there was no leg room (I’m short as well), and the staff was rude. This was by far the worst airline I have ever flown with hands down.",-1

Once took my daughters family, my sister and myself, (including 2 children), that trip was in October. Great rates, on time flights, so the seats don't recline and you bring a bottle of water, it's worth it! Took the same trip in May with my 3 sisters for a girls week. Same experience! Online right now to book same route for family trip to Disney world in Nov. Thank you Spirit.",1
2018-05-31,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Las Vegas,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,They went the extra mile,True,"  Tampa to Las Vegas. The captain came out, greeted us and told us about the tropical depression over the gulf. He said that the ride might be rough. He let us know that he would take off the seatbelt sign when we found smooth air. The captain and the first stewardess greeted everyone as they entered the plane with a genuine smile. I was one of the first to enter as I`m disabled and can`t walk long distances. I use a walker all the time. There were three handicaped people that entered the plane first. The flight crew were very attentive to us as well as to all the passengers needs, serving drinks and snacks. One disabled man behind me complained about not having a blanket, then later in the flight said he was having breathing problems. The head flight attendant jumped into action, directed all the other attendants what to do, and they administered oxygen to the man. One oxygen bottle was used and a second bottle was offered but the man was told the airlines would need to call for an ambulance for him upon arival of the plane. At that point, he declined. The captain was kept apprised of the situatation and was prepared to divert to a closer airport if the situation worsened. The man improved and the flight landed as scheduled. At one point the captain came out as a courtesy to see that everything was ok. I was very impressed with the crew and the captain. In my opinion the man used the entire situation as an attention getter and was not as severely handicaped as he claimed because on arrival at our destination; he jumped up and walked very quickly out of the plane on his own, being the first passenger by a long ways, out of the plane! All in all, the Spirit staff performed admirably! As a disabled person I would be very happy to fly with Spirit again. Very competent and professional staff from check-in, to landing, to leaving the airport! They went the extra mile for everyone's comfort.",1
2018-05-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Phoenix,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly on this airline again,False,"  Chicago to Phoenix. Customer Service is a joke. My wife and i had to take an unpaid day off of work due to a flight time change after booking. On way to Chicago the flight time got changed to the evening after we were on our way. The airline provided us with a voucher, but according to their guidelines we are unable to use the voucher during their times. Spoke on the phone to two different customer service only for them to read voucher guideline policies. All I was asking for was an extension of the voucher time period and they refused to even attempt to work something out. On top of that you have to pay for a snack and a bag in an uncomfortable plane. I will never fly on this airline again.",-1
2018-05-30,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Tampa,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,5.0,I will fly Spirit again,True,"  Las Vegas to Tampa. I was reluctant to fly spirit after all the bad reviews but I was not disappointed in any way. The main thing is to get where you're going safely. Their aircraft are all very recent Airbus. The seats do not recline and they will charge you for baggage and incidentals, but still it was a much better fare than anyone else offered. Do your homework before you fly and you wont be unpleasantly surprised. The ground crew were civil if not overflowing with love and the flight crew the same. They work some very long hours and have to deal with some very entitled people. The pilot on our outbound leg was a perfect blend of humorous and efficiency. We were late because of security on our home leg and got to the gate with only seconds to spare and they let us on. I will fly Spirit again and would like to shout out to all the folks who got us there and back again safely. If you want to pay a bundle and fly with someone who has a few more inches of legroom and a reclining seat, go ahead. Spirit is awesome.",1

This is the worst airline ever with the most expensive fees for carry-on bags. They charged us 200 for carry-on bags. The plane is too old. It seems most of the people are unsatisfied with it. This is my first and last time flying with this airline.,-1

Other then they charge extra for everything, seats, snacks, and Carry on. They have no plugs to charge phone and the customer service sucks! I called to see what are my options after my flight was delayed. I was suppose to be at my destination at 3pm now the estimated arrival is 7:45pm! They only thing they could do was refund my money or put me on a later flight. Why would I do that? I sat on the plane for over a hour before they told us we had to deboard. Like really! I hate flying with Spirit and do not recommend. Pay extra or you will regret it.",-1

Spirit is a typical low cost carrier - they tend to offer lowest fares of all the airlines in the US and they offer nothing for free as everything is optional. They offer onboard purchase of drinks and snacks, you can prebook checked or carryon luggage etc. But since they really operate as a low-cost carrier, they tend to hold the tight schedule of flights and they are the most efficient of all US airlines we tried - they really try to speed up the boarding process and be efficient.",1
2018-05-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Dallas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,you must pay for your snack drink,True,"  Economy air travel is notorious for being uncomfortable and unpleasant. After my most recent three-leg flight from Lima to Florida, Dallas, and then Las Vegas with Spirit Airlines, I now realize that Spirit Airlines is a rogue airline. In the “Spirit” of offering lower economy ticket prices, Spirit has essentially stripped the seat cushions, instead providing a single, thin, pseudo-leather fabric layer overlying the anatomically incorrect plastic seat mold that does not recline whatsoever. To be unable to recline during an international, overnight flight means there will be no sleeping. The leg room provided by Spirit would be ample only for children and little people, as the knees of nearly all normal sized adults around me on all three flights were found to be abutting the hard seatbacks ahead of them at one point or another during my flights. Accordingly, sleeping while laying your head on the iPad mini-sized tray table in front of you is out of the question because your head hits the skull-splitting seatback before reaching the cold tray table. Spirit armrests are not only razor thin, but they are notably lower and shorter, making them virtually useless. Spirit decided that you must pay exorbitant Disneyland prices for your carbohydrate snack item and fizzy drink that would cost no more than $1.50 total at a convenience store. Free cup of water at least? No, $3 for a 17 oz of bottled water. I guess it shouldn’t come as a surprise that at the Spirit price point there is no LCD screen attached to every headrest, but is it really cost saving to supplant the very handy pocket at the back of the seat with a bungee cord system? Also, where is the cup holder? AC power outlet? USB outlet? After spending some 13 hours with Spirit today, I have begun to feel more sardine than human.",-1
2018-05-28,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Cleveland via Ft Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,just go with a real airline,True,"  Lima to Cleveland via Ft Lauderdale. I get that the idea with a super budget airline is that you only pay for the services you want; that’s why tickets are so cheap. However, who travels without baggage?! Most people choose to carry on to avoid the checked bag fee, but with spirit, no carry on is included, and checking was actually cheaper. I came from an airport where even water bottles purchased after security were not allowed, so I could not bring my own water and had to buy a bottle. On a 5.5 hour international flight, not even water was provided! There actually is adequate leg room, but seats do not go back so it’s almost impossible to sleep and there is no entertainment screen. Perhaps if you are doing a short 2-3 hour flight tops, this could be a cheap option to get you there. For international flights, just go with a real airline.",-1

I purchased my son an unaccompanied minor ticket and picked seat 1F and paid extra for the seat back in March and then I had to reschedule his flight to 3 days later than I expected and they said he will get his seat that I had purchased on the next flight because it was available and they lied and still took my money and on top of that, they charged me 90 bucks to cancel the first flight when both flights cost the same price. Now I'm waiting for a refund on the seat and I had to call to make sure of it and they can't send me no receipt for that or give me a confirmation number or email and if they knew they sold my seat then they should of automatically reimbursed me my money. When I arrived two hours early to get my sons boarding pass and I waited so long and the representative just let some lady cut me without checking to see if she was next. We both had kids there and let's see if they'll give me my money for my seat in 7 days and they will never get my money again. I would rather pay extra to be treated like a valued customer.",-1

Not satisfied, will not be booking Spirit Airlines unless its the last resort. No inflight entertainment for a five hour flight. I could go on and on but not worth the time. They act like the flights are cheap and then get you on everything else. Consumer would rather be charged a fare rate up front then get hit with a bunch of other fees. $42 to check a bag, all other $25. 49lbs max, everyone else 50. It’s obvious that you are making up for the sometimes cheaper flights. Guess I should be grateful the flight was not delayed like I have heard from multiple people.",-1

Our flight departed late due to ""computer issues"" in the cockpit. When we landed in Las Vegas, our connecting flight to Boston had just left 5 minutes earlier. The very rude Spirit employees told us that the next earliest flight would be in 24 hours. They told us that they couldn't compensate us on a hotel because it was ""air traffic controls fault"", which was a flat out lie, seeing as our pilot had already told us it was due to computer issues on board. They gave us a ""coupon"" for ""discounted"" local hotels, and when we called the number, the hotels that were offered were double the price of what we easily found on Google. We ended up taking a $20 Uber ride to a $40 hotel, and missing the first day of a $140 music festival. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the completely useless ""customer service"" which refused to compensate me for a single cent, even after talking to a supervisor. I will never fly this poor excuse for an airline again.",-1
2018-05-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I didn't get what I paid for,True," Let me start off by saying the fact that I'm even writing this review shows how done I am with Spirit Airlines. I've never felt the need to write a negative review of anything. I've flown with Spirit many times, their flights aren't as good as most of the other airlines, but you know, you get what you pay for. Only problem is I didn't get what I paid for, I had to pay twice and a higher price the second time to get what I had paid for. Then the only response I could get from their customer service was just sucks for you. Here's the whole story. I had booked a round flight but missed my outgoing flight, so I booked a second one to make my trip. 9 hours before my returning flight I go to check in and find out they cancelled it. I go through my email; nothing from Spirit to tell me they are going to bump me from this flight that is not even half full (so it's not even like they gave my seat to someone else). I had to book a last minute ticket on the same flight. I've talked to the customer service multiple times both before and after that flight and the only response I get from them is pretty much not my problem. They cancel my flight with no refund or notice of any type and the only thing they have to say is sucks to suck (I might be paraphrasing but that how it came through) I wasn't even asking for a refund I just wanted something in lieu of my bad experience, other-than oh well.",-1
2018-05-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Detroit,,,,,,1.0,1.0,flight had been cancelled,False,  Dallas to Detroit. I showed up at the airport and found out my flight had been cancelled even though I kept receiving emails saying I was good to go. Then in order to reschedule my flight I would be charged $100 because it was an airport modification or cancellation. I purchased the protection plan on the original flight and they would not accept it because it was not cancelled do to a medical emergency. I am military and they also were trying to charge me for my carry on bag. All I was trying to do was fly home to see my family for the weekend. I hardly ever get a chance to see them do to my job. I figured being Memorial Day weekend and me being military they would care at least a little but nope they did not. This is unacceptable to treat people like this especially when the airline is the one who cancelled the flight. Without any notice at that. I had to travel 2 and a half hours one way to even get to the airport. So I woke up at 2:30 in the morning to drive all the way to the airport just to find out that I was not able to go home after all to see my family and they did not want to help out at all. After this I think the only way I would ever fly with them again is if it was 100% all expenses paid vacation that I won from some type of drawing.,-1
2018-05-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Columbus via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,never fly with them again,True,  Cancun to Columbus via Ft Lauderdale. Absolute worst flying experience ever. The flight was 2.5 hours behind our first leg from Cancun to Ft lauderdale. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. Not only did they refuse to help passengers but they told us it would be more than 48 hours to get us on another flight leaving us stranded in Florida. They did not help board stranded customers when one customer asked what they were supposed to do the response from the spirit employee was “ it’s not our concern”. We asked for a refund of our missed flight and booked with another carrier (southwest) and had to eat an additional $850 just to return home. Way to almost ruin a great trip. Will never fly with them again or book with Apple vacations! No customer service at all and absolutely everything cost extra money. I’m surprised they didn’t charge for breathing while flying,-1

These two ladies behind the desk could not have cared less about helping me, or seeing what they could do to help my situation. One of them even laughed at me when I had asked if I could change it to an earlier flight. I don't normally leave reviews, but this was not the first unfortunate situation I have been in with Spirit. They were sarcastic and rude. I am never flying with this airline again.",-1

My flight was scheduled to leave MSY at 5:30 am, and we sat on the plane for two hours because they were having ""computer"" problems. The problem was actually with the engine, and they did not give us any information, just to leave the plane. All passengers were told to stay close because repairs would not take long, and we ended up sitting around the terminal for over 4 hours with no updates or information. The flight ended up not taking off and I had to reschedule for the next day. The staff was very rude and very unhelpful. I will not be flying Spirit again.",-1
2018-05-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Kansas City,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,he doesn’t get the discount,False,  Los Angeles to Kansas City. The flight was fine. This review is about when we were checking our bags with Spirit. They talk about how they let military check bags for free. They don’t. My boyfriend is a veteran. Because he’s a veteran that means he doesn’t get the discount even though every other airline give it to him. I don’t normally care to ever write reviews and I never complain about discounts but this lady was unpleasant and veterans are military. I won’t be flying with them anymore. I have dealt with the Spirit before without him with me and I got over the fact the seat are uncomfortable and they won’t even give you free water and their luggage prices are insanely high. But that pushed me over the line and it’s ridiculous. Never again.,-1

Really bad airline, terrible customer service, they give wrong information about the hour to departure and delays which make you lost your flight. To explain it better i was supposed to fly to denver from Miami but for a weather situation the flight was delayed but that's not the problem because that can happen in any airline but the problem was when i made the check in online and the flight was delayed to 10.29 pm and in the boarding pass say 8.59pm . I call to customer service and after a long waiting time a guy say that the flight was delayed even more to 12.44. I was really confused because i didn't know to who believe email- 10.29, boarding pass 8.59 or the guy from customer service 12.44. I call back again and this time was a girl who tall me that my flight was for 10.29.",-1

It's crazy you can only bring 1 bag and an average purse counts as a carry on but ok. However, their communication is abysmal. I'm still waiting for a flight to take off that's been delayed two hours. But no one told us how log it would be delayed. I was fortunate enough to have enough battery to check my email, where I was informed of a new arrival time. Boards showed outdated status all night and no one said anything to passengers. Which also hinders the ability to communicate travel plans with family. The gate agents weren't even available to speak with because they were constantly tied up dealing with issues. Their prices make travel more affordable, but I'll pay the extra for better customer service moving forward. Major inconvenience for those trying to return home to start a work week.",-1

I have a 5 year old with me. Offered no help, no hotel or food for my child. Have been sitting at the airport for over 24 hours waiting for another flight. I have tried to get a refund so that I can get on another plane, but they have done nothing. I’m tired, my child is tired and all they can say is there’s nothing we can do about it!

2018-05-18,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford CT to Orlando FL,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,zero issues,True," I flew Spirit Airlines round trip from Hartford CT to Orlando FL with zero issues. Were the seats comfortable, not lazy boy quality but they did their job. I'm a fairly large guy 6ft, 250 and I wasn't cramped but things were tight. All things I knew, I signed up for the sake of saving money to have a nicer vacation. If you need super comfortable seats or to be pampered this isn't the airline for you. If you need to get where you are going and save some money then this is wonderful. The in-flight snacks I had gotten for my 3 year old, were they cheap? No, but nothing usually is while traveling.",1

Flight was scheduled at 9:59pm from Ft Lauderdale to arrive in Tampa at 10:49 pm. Stared getting flight updates at 9:27am, 12 hours before scheduled departure, that flight would be delayed. Flight ended up being delayed almost 3 hours. Didn't arrive in Tampa until almost 1:30am. Terrible flight.",-1

My adventure started with a 45min line to check your own bag. Then security took an additional hour. The seats were uncomfortable and the flight attendents were rude. This airline makes you pay $3 for water. No complimentary anything. Then once I had landed in Los Angeles I found out they had lost my luggage. It is now going on over a week of it being lost! Never flying this airline  again!,-1
2018-05-16,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Chicago,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,employee was so polite and courteous,True,  Houston to Chicago. We are stuck in Houston waiting for our flight to be released into Chicago. There has been absolutely no communication up until this point other than emails stating that our flight has been delayed. I spoke to several Spirit employees who would not release any information to me or were rude when I try to find out what is going on. Having open communication is key so customers understand What is going on and what to expect. I approached another employee who was so polite and courteous explaining to me exactly what was going on. He explained that there is bad weather in Chicago and showed me the radar and said that Chicago is not allowing flights to come in at this point. He said our plane is here at the Houston airport and so is the flight staff they just got here from their hotel. They are  waiting for weather to clear so we can safely land in Chicago. Thank you for his open communication. He truly cared and took the time to explain what was going on which relieved a lot of worry on our part.,1
2018-05-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Medellin to New York via Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never travel Spirit again,True,"  Medellin to New York via Fort Lauderdale. My Flight was delayed by 45 mins due to weather. Which meant that there would only be an hour or less to go through security, customs and immigration. Spirit Airlines stated their policy is to give at least 90 mins for connecting flights but I had less than an hour. I understand the weather but they knew we would not have sufficient time to make connections and did not adjust the schedule of the connection so that we could make the connection and when we missed the connection we were told the next available flight was Wednesday and it was Monday night. No hotel just a standby voucher on a flight that probably won't have any available seats. So, now I have to spend the night at the airport possibly 2 nights if there is no standby seats available in the morning. And they will not compensate me for the time lost at work, as well. I talked with the supervisor and she told me I need to write an email if I feel I should be compensated. Bottom line don't waste your money on this airline. This  airline won't even give you a glass of water and you have to pay for your carry on. I will never travel Spirit again.",-1

2018-05-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,find a better airline,True,  Las Vegas to Dallas Ft Worth. I have flown Spirit three times and all three experiences were the worst. As I sit in the airport with a 48 hour delay just to get home on Mother's Day. I arrived at the airport in Dallas an hour before takeoff the staff denied me my boarding pass which caused me to miss my flight I thought no big deal so I went and booked a one-way with American Airlines figuring at least I had my one way back with Spirit but boy was I wrong! while being denied my boarding pass I could have at least been instructed that the rest of my flight was canceled due to me missing the first plane in Dallas but instead I receive no email nor notification I went on with my vacation in Vegas just to arrive at the airport and print out my boarding pass only to find out that they had cancelled my flight. I must say this is the most ridiculous Airline - around every corner they are looking to take your money. I would not advise flying with Spirit you'll do better spending more money to get the treatment you deserve and customer service you deserve for your money. I explained my situation to the customer service agent and she told me that my ticket was nonrefundable even though I wasn't the one to cancel and that my ticket was non-transferable and then she offered to sell me my same flight for $293 for a one-way when I paid 107 for the round trip. Save your money and your headache and find a better airline.,-1

Check in bag is usually at least 50 lbs, theirs was 40 which caused us to pay an extra 30.00. Get on plane take off was delayed by 30 minutes. On our return flight we was delayed again by 15-20 minutes because the pilot was late! Seating was uncomfortable. Spirit will be our last choice next time.",-1
2018-05-12,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Seattle,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,3.0,5.0,attentive and helpful flight attendants,True," I’ve flown Spirit three times in 2018, SEA-BWI return and from LAS-SEA. All three flights were on time or early, with attentive and helpful flight attendants. Check in was easy for all flights and bags arrived promptly. Based on other reviews, it seems like bad experiences with Spirit fall into one of two categories. First, Spirit does not handle delays well, and they often fly routes only once a day, meaning there are few alternative flights if your flight is late. This seems to be the airline’s weak spot, and passengers should be prepared to deal with delays—that seems to be one of the costs of low fares, though it is something I have yet to experience personally. The second category of problem seems more preventable. Many passengers fly Spirit thinking the airline’s policies are similar to those of other airlines, which creates problems at the airport as I have seen first-hand when at the Spirit check-in counter. For those individuals thinking of flying Spirit, I would recommend the following to ensure you have a pleasant experience. Read the airline’s rules, especially about baggage/personal items ahead of time. Weigh bags at home to avoid surprises. I’ve done this and had no problems at the airport. Spirit has a 40 lb (18 kg) limit, which is less than the 50 lb (23 kg) limit of most other US airlines. Remember that (as of this writing), if you only have one bag, it’s cheaper to check the bag than to carry it on. Print boarding passes in advance or use your phone as a boarding pass. Pay for bags when purchasing tickets. If you book your bag online when you buy your ticket, it’s cheaper than buying it later on. If you want the cheapest tickets, purchasing tickets at the airport is less expensive than online ($40 savings per ticket round-trip). Unlike other US domestic airlines, Spirit does not provide free nonalcoholic drinks, including water. I recommend you bring an empty water bottle and fill it up at a drinking fountain after passing security. Flight attendants can also provide a cup of ice or a cup of hot water (bring your own tea bag), free of charge. It’s true Spirit has extra fees for baggage, seat assignments, drinks, etc., but if you do the math ahead of time, it’s definitely possible to save money depending on the fare. For some folks, it’s not worth it, and that’s fine—Spirit isn’t for everyone. But if you’re willing to do a little extra work and pack light, the savings can be well worth it.",1
2018-05-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,customer service was terrible,True, Booked to fly Las Vegas to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline I have ever flown. Our flight was delayed twice while already seated inside the plane. They said the “plane’s engine wasn’t working” which definitely made us feel unsafe. People went to the front desk to ask for a refund and customer service was terrible. You would think they check their planes before take-off. I would have much preferred to drive back home than spend 7 hours with Spirit to get back home when it could have been a 4 hour drive.,-1

Charging $40 for an 18kg checked in luggage? 18kg vs 23kg that others charge! My entire 1 way flight cost $400 while others were charging $300.

Three times the flight changed and was delayed. There was no answers on to why this was happening and even though the crew was nice., there was no apology for the delay and no answers. And prior to take off we waited almost another hour just sitting in the plane. Was suppose to depart (the final time change of departure) was 9:23 and didn't leave until 10:08.

We called customer Services on the phone to check about the carry on, we had the right size, at check in line we get pulled to the side to pay for our carry on, when they let a lot of customers to got on with two, a carry on and a personally item. For me and my daughter they charge us $110.00 for our carry on, that was too much for us to pay for one way ticket for us. There was no good customer services at checking in, that was the worth flight I have ever had, I will never fly with Spirit again. Spirit Airline have no customer service , trying to get money any way they can, they sell you food and drinks. They charge you for your carry one, even if you ship your bag they charge.",-1
2018-05-09,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Orlando,3.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,4.0,4.0,We were perfectly satisfied,True,"  We felt safe and cared for. The flight attendants were curteous and funny. I do not feel Spirit is subpar and will fly with them again. I would advise checking into all the luggage requirements online prior to arriving at the airport. They allow one personal item per passenger (my teens and husband took full size backpacks containing all their belongings). I chose to pay for a carry on suitcase (up to 40# was $90 round trip). I also carried a large purse as my personal item. I paid $19 round trip per seat to choose our seats together. You can opt to not sit together and not be charged too. There are no complimentary drinks or snacks in flight. We did not mind, as I had plenty of both in my purse. Consumers need to be aware of the differences between Spirit and other airlines and compare total costs. We were perfectly satisfied doing without the small things for our discount airfare",1
2018-05-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,he worst experience ever,True,"  Baltimore to Oakland. This airline is the worst experience ever. The fact is my flight which was at 2:05 has been changed to 9:40 PM and there is no other flight that can get us to our destination we actually have to sit here and wait till 940 at night mind you I have been here at the LAX since 11:11 am. We were given a $7.00 food voucher, but what meal costs $7.00 at the airport. Not only is there not a back up plan to escort us to our destination the staff shows little or no concern about our frustration. After reading the reviews I do not understand how spirit remains operable. I will never take this airline again",-1

Customer service is the worse ever, selectively charging people for carry-on bags. Even though the item fits the personal item measurement it wouldn’t let four customers in. At the same time letting other passengers go in with two items, other airlines charge $25 for carry on bags and Spirit charge $40-65. Just unreasonable prices and why so expense supposed to facilitate to attract customers.",-1

The moral of the story is that you get what you pay for! We saw great deal on round trip flights and purchased them! Our entire experience wasn't pleasant. The Spirit airline representatives in the airport were very rude and ignorant, not just to us but too a lot of other customers. It was crazy to see how many other customers were very upset with their service! We also got hit with a nice luggage fee which cost us almost an extra $400 total! It was also interesting to watch a lot of other customers giving the same reaction as us to this surprise luggage fee. I also bought a brand new suitcase for the trip, which is now broken. After seeing the other ratings for this Airline, it all makes sense.",-1

2018-05-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Atlanta,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit again,True,  Tampa to Atlanta. This has got to be the worst experience I’ve ever had the misfortune to experience. We had a trip to OAK planned on May 5th and I paid for 2 one way tickets $190 each. Last minute plans out of our control changed forcing us to cancel/rebook to ATL. I lost all but $60 of both tickets and booked one for my father and one for myself. The customer service person was atrocious and was next to useless. After 30 minutes on the phone and a $75 change fee on one ticket and the other was supposed to use the credit?? Yeah explain that one!! Today I go to check in and mine was ok and allowed me to check in. My fathers we could not locate we unfortunately have to call customer service again. After another very unhelpful gentleman we found out that when the ticket was rebooked it was rebooked to leave from Atlanta to Oakland on the seventh have no idea why. At this point we were 3 hour to wheels up and I was told that day of change fee with the cancelled fee from the last booking I’d be out another $107! I get to the airport and my TSA precheck was not carried over and now had to go though the regular line and was pulled aside to be patted down and my bag checked. The staff at the gate awesome! Got my dad and I a seat next to one another. The stewards were get and the flight was good. We arrive in ATL 15 mins early and find out that Delta is at the gate and we have to wait 45 minutes for the gate to open. I cannot tell you how strongly I feel that I will never fly Spirit again.,-1

Plane was delayed more than an hour in Houston. Made us late for the connecting flight in Ft. Lauderdale. Spirit comped a hotel room and meals ($7.00 per meal) but made no mention of what we were in store for the next day. As you know, the hotel checkout time is noon. Our flight was not until 11:43PM. The hotel shuttle did not bring us back to the airport... saying that we had to wait more than an hour. We ended up taking an Uber. Once at the airport, the airline refused to let us check our bags citing some vague FAA rule about accepting bags before 4 hours pre-flight. Then we were stuck. No place to go, no way to go, and no food without hiring another Uber or Taxi. The first Spirit employee was progressively rude. The second employee walked away when I demanded to speak with a supervisor after a she was short with me. Finally, the third person made a valid attempt to help but failed because he could not find our account in the system (which later we found our had to do with how we were processed the night before). We went back to the first rude guy, who was ""guarding"" the lanes to customer service. We wound up walking right past him and talking to a different agent. This agent found our account but could not find where we had paid for 2 checked bags. After more than 30 minutes literally fighting with them at the CS counter and waiting for a ""supervisor"" to approve our flight (one we already paid for and were supposedly rebooked to) and our luggage, we were finally accepted and allowed to check our bags. Now we are waiting 10 hours to catch the next available flight. An entire day of our vacation wasted because of Spirit... not to mention having to fight with them to get what they should have freely given to begin with. Never again. After this trip I am done with Spirit forever.",-1

My flight from DFW to ATL was originally supposed to fly out at 8:30am and arrive 12:30pm. The flight was delayed twice and at 9:30 the second delay they said the aircraft had been struck by lightning and we do not know yet what out next step is. Back and forth between costumer service over the phone and people standing at the podium furiously trying to get other options to fly on another flight or to be put on another airline, no one knows anything and can’t really help until they get updates from the manager! Stating that only when the flight is canceled the manager will tell us whether we can put passengers on different airline. 10:14 I receive an email saying flight is canceled “extended delay” until tomorrow morning. However people at the podium are still saying we don’t know yet. It’s 12:38pm now and I got a refund which doesn’t really help me because I missed my meeting in Atlanta and wasted my time with them. People do not have time to waste. Time is the most thing I’m furiated about because they wasted my time figuring out what plan B is and not offering other reasonable options to cover up their unprofessional airline problems. I will never ever fly this airline again and will not recommend anyone I know to ever fly with them! If I could give it a 0 rating I would",-1

I am extremely frustrated with the automated help centre lack of options to speak to any customer service rep. No option to speak to a customer service rep.

Worst airline ever and will not fly with them ever again even tho they are cheap. Needed to book a last minute flight and they were the only reasonable cost. First their website was down and kicked me out in the middle of the booking. I called them on an 801 area code which I don’t think is toll free. The rep on the phone was so rude and didn’t know what she was doing. I think they were out of country reps. Wanted to charge me $25 to book my flight even though the site was down. Totally inconvenienced me to try all this stuff on the computer to try to get it working and refused to waive the $25 booking fee then ended up hanging up on me. When the site came back up I booked the flight and it was delayed a total of 5 times before I got to bored. All staff was rude and wasn’t helpful, accommodating or friendly. By far the worst airline I’ve been on. Judging by the reviews I’m not the only one that thinks so.",-1

The seats are so uncomfortable. There was an altercation on the flight between two passengers - it became very vulgar and disruptive. The flight attendants took forever to come and break it up.

2018-05-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I am extremely upset,True,"  Cancun to Dallas Ft Worth. Monday April 23rd we boarded an American Airlines flight from DFW to Cancun, Mexico to take my 18 yr old daughter on her high school graduation trip. Once on the plane, my husband realized he had lost his Polish greencard in the airport. They allowed him off the plane to try and retrace his steps to locate it to no avail. We knew it was somewhere close to the TSA checkpoint because he had it to get his boarding pass just before. Once we got to Mexico, I called your customer service line explaining to the agent what had happened and asked her what we needed to do because we wanted to be prepared before trying to fly back. She told me that as long as he has his passport and another form of ID, even if it's just a credit card, that he would be allowed to board the plane back. DFW had located his greencard and we would pick it up when he went through imigration. He was still uneasy about this, but I assured him that the agent I spoke with told me it would be no problem. Our return flight was for last Friday morning April 27th. We arrived at the airport plenty early to make sure there were no issues with him getting onto the plane. We walked to the counter and explained the situation to the staff  working and what the other agent had said. We also provided him with his Polish passport and the boarding pass from the original flight and were told he could not board the plane. He then called over a supervisor who looked at us, not the computer or any of our documentation, only us and said ""You can't board"" and walked away. At a loss of what to do, he told me and my daughter to board the plane and he would stay behind to see what he needed to do. I don't know if you have ever had to leave someone you love in a country you're not familiar with, but it's damn hard to do. I knew staying behind with him would cost us twice as much and that I had to get my daughter back home. So we boarded the plane without him. He spent another 24 hours in the Cancun airport alone with no sleep waiting for a flight we had to pay out of pocket for on another airline to get to Mexico City. From there he had to take another flight to Laredo Mexico and pay for a taxi to take him to the port of entry where he had to walk  across the bridge, be detained by immigration, put in a cell and wait until they could scan his prints to show that he is in fact legal to cross the border. Once he paid the $586 fee to re-enter through, we then had to pay out of pocket for a hotel room so that he would have a place to sleep for the night as well as pay for another  flight back to DFW where he then picked up his greencard at the lost and found office. To call this trip a nightmare is an understatement. Had the agents at the counter made the call to verify our story and information, we could have easily flown to DFW and had it taken care of with absolutely no issue. Instead we had to endure 2 more days of stress not knowing what was going to happen as well as another $1200 that had to be put on our credit card. I am extremely upset with how this was handled. When speaking to imigration at the border, the agents explained to him that he could have easily boarded the plane and imigration at DFW could have easily handled it there. Instead, I had to explain to my daughter that it was not her fault just because it's where she wanted to go for her senior trip. We are not well off people and we saved for 6 months to take her on this trip, only to have it turn into this mess!",-1

Customer service is something Spirit airlines has no concept of. When our flight was cancelled due to a storm today, we were advised the soonest flight would be 3 days later! One storm caused 3 days of no flights. The supervisor was extremely rude and disrespectful with concern to the hundreds of dollars that we are now missing out on due to their cancellation. We are now out the hotel fees and the fees paid for the event. Do not fly Spirit unless you want to be stranded somewhere! Out of the 4 times I have flown, 3 times I have used Spirit.

I bought my ticket for $65 from New York to Denver and when I got to the airport at first they charged $100 at the counter for a small box that’s all the luggage that I had left with me. So when I got to my gate again they wanted to pay $65 for my small purse and I said no I will not pay for it, the supervisor was the one who told me that and she was rude. She told me that if I don’t pay for it I will not get on that flight and I would have to have wait for the next flight. I ended up paying for it while I was very upset. Spirit airlines put their flight very cheap so that they could charge more for everything which includes water and you overpay for baggage that’s their catch. Me my family and my friends will never fly with this airline again.",-1
2018-05-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to San Diego,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,scammed with almost $400,True,"  Baltimore to San Diego. This is one of the worst experiences I have  had with an airline. The Spirit representatives cannot be trusted. I was running late to catch my flight back to San Diego on April 25th. I thought it would be a good idea to contact the airline to let me know I was running late. I got to the airport at 4:26 pm, as I was on the phone explaining my situation to the Spirit Representative, he insisted that I could no longer board the plane. I had already check-in online. My plane was scheduled to leave at 4:50 p.m. I asked if he could credit my $ to a new ticket and he said, ""NO"". I was offered tickets for almost triple the amount of my original tickets and he also said that not very many seats were left on the flight he was looking up. My ride said he could probably find cheaper tickets on-line - the rep overheard and told me that I would not find anything cheaper online. I then proceeded to book my flight. I provided my payment information to the rep and he put me on hold. While I was on hold my ride found tickets for $402 on the same flight, I could not believe it! I decided I was going to cancel my transaction when I got back on the line with the representative. I told the rep that I wanted to cancel my flight. He said that I could not cancel and if I did I would not get my money back. At that point I had no other option but to accept that I had just gotten lied to and scammed with almost $400 by Spirit. The next day I re-affirmed that Spirit representatives are liars. and they will take advantage of your vulnerable situation. At least 6 passengers got on the plane after take off time 4:51 p.m. and to be exact there were 50+ empty seats on the plane and not a few seats as he had informed me. Spirit Representative cannot be trusted, I recommend never to book a flight through their customer services. Always buy your tickets on-line and always try to catch your plane/flight no matter what the Spirit Representative tells you.",-1

2018-05-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Boston via Myrtle Beach,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly this airline again,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Boston via Myrtle Beach. We were warned - with Spirit you pay extra for everything! So we knew what to expect, but we were still terribly disappointed with the entire experience. I pre-paid for our seats and checked bags ahead of time, as we were traveling with 2 younger children and didn't want to take more time at the counter than we needed to. Problems started at the check in kiosk. First, our boarding passes wouldn't print. Then, I weighed my bag as I knew it was overweight, and I had to pay an extra $55 on top of the $45 I already paid ahead of time. Then, our luggage tags wouldn't print. We were told to go to the Agent Assistance line to get tags printed. After waiting a good 20 minutes, the agent told us we were too early, which was fine (a valid explanation) and that when it was time to check the bags, to come back to the Bag Drop line and they would print the tags for us. Fast forward to check in time, I went to the Bag Drop line, waited at least 15 minutes, only to be told I was supposed to go to the Agent Assistance Line. I went to the Agent Assistance Line, waited 25 minutes, and was then told that I didn't actually have to pay extra for my overweight bag because my kids' bags were so light - but that there was nothing he could do about it, I was out $55. At this point, I'm NOT happy dragging 4 bags through 3 different lines for 40 minutes, having paid an extra $55 that I didn't actually have to pay, and not being able to get it or my time back. There was a complete lack of organization and communication among the staff, which made for a very frustrating check in process. I will never fly this airline again. I'm willing to pay more to get more and avoid all this aggravation.",-1

I would not recommend this airline to even the worst of enemies. They overbooked the flight, lied in the flight confirmation process on their website, then try to bully me into paying them more money for the next available flight. They let you confirm your flight and seating when you check in online (check-in time doesn't matter--earlier won't help you if the flight is already fully booked and more profitable customers check in), upgrading your seating won't help. Conspicuously they won't send your boarding pass, however, they suggested during the confirmation process that I take a voucher for a later flight. At the airport I was then sent to a specific attendant who delivered a canned speach and tried to convince me that I did not complete the check-in process and they have the right to bump you when the flight is overbooked. Be aware, this company does not have your interests in mind one bit.",-1

I was delayed on my return flight home five times. My flight out of St Thomas was delayed by 40 minutes. Then my connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale was delayed two times prior to me ever arriving for a total of 5 hours layover in Fort Lauderdale. The flight was supposed to have left at 9:49 p.m. and we did not leave until 1 a.m. in the morning on the 20th. I had rude customer service from the Spirit Airlines customer service in Fort Lauderdale and upon boarding the plane the plane was held up in Fort Lauderdale so that they could contact the corporate office to put a different number in the computer. This was stated by the pilot. Then upon arrival in Tampa we were held up for 20 minutes on the tarmac because we were not allowed to come into the gate. Upon contacting customer service Spirit Airlines they had no intention and would refuse to admit wrong. They wanted to charge for everything including a soda and felt they did not need to compensate any of the guests that had been laying around the Fort Lauderdale Airport because they were so tired. Not even a simple water or a cup of coffee. I have had many delays and flights cancelled over the years but this was the worst. And for the corporate office to try to blame everything on a storm in the Boston Massachusetts area was beyond a joke. When confronted with this I asked them why they stated that a flight out of St Thomas was delayed by a storm in Boston Massachusetts they couldn't keep their story straight and only wanted to give a $50 credit towards another flight. I told them I would never fly with him again and staying true to that I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again,-1
2018-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Richmond,2.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,not valued as a customer,True," Fort Lauderdale to Richmond. My daughter and I checked in online and had our boarding passes. We arrived at the airport an hour before the flight was to take off. We asked several Spirit agents who were standing around where to check our bags because we had checked in online and paid our baggage fees. We were incorrectly ushered to two different lines, both extremely long. When we discovered we were in the wrong line, we were told we missed boarding, that the gate was closed and the plane was about to take off. We start trying to figure out what to do next. About ten minutes later we hear our names being called repeatedly to board. Great, but now we haven’t checked our bags - we can’t take it, we can’t leave it. The plane takes off and we’re left wondering what just happened. Not one single agent that we asked to help us in the beginning spoke English well or seemed to have any idea about online check in. So we went to the agent counter. We were told that they could put us on the next flight, (the next day, as this route is a once a day deal) for over $200. I told the agent we only paid $100 for both tickets. She said her price was the cheapest I was going to find, as I was online booking again for $100 for both tickets. After much back and forth, a Manager was called and we were given a credit for our baggage fees, $50. So we were just out $100 on the tickets. The next morning we arrived for the next flight and were given a hard time about the baggage credit, we were told it could only be used with the same reservation number, which makes no sense at all. They also charged me $10 extra for “paying” for my baggage in the airport rather than online, even though there was no way to pay with a credit online. I felt robbed, disrespected and not valued as a customer. The “1” I gave on the rating is for the flight attendants, who were amazing and friendly.",-1

2018-04-18,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Dallas,1.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,they are well worth the cost,True,"  Las Vegas to Dallas. The only bad reviews I read about Spirit are about the extra baggage and seat cost which still total to cheaper than the other airlines round trips. There are complaints about the seats being small, the flight is cheap so you get what you pay for. I always get whats expected with Spirit being so cheap. I get on the plane, go to sleep, wake up at my destination. If you are looking for a cozy, five star, first class flight then do not fly Spirit. I've flown with them 9 times round trips so far and was satisfied with every  one! I had 1 delayed flight due to inclement weather (every airline has delayed flights). They gave me and my boyfriend two food vouchers each, bought us a hotel, and paid for the cab fare to and from the hotel to the airport. If my total round trip come to $250+ with Spirit, I always go with another airlines but that is very rare. I get deals sent to my email about $39 flights. Even after I pay for baggage and a seats (which I rarely purchase) it still less than $150. I love Spirit and think they are well worth the cost.",1

My flight was delayed three hours for rain that had stopped a whole hour before the flight even was supposed to board then we finally get on the plane and can’t take off because two flight attendants were over time - so they made us get off the plane walk to another gate across the airport and wait another two hours to reboard another flight. They then lost the bags causing everyone to walk across the airport again to get their bags because the luggage was misplaced. I didn’t get home until 3:45am, I was supposed to be home by 9:30pm.",-1

The woman helping us at Newark airport was extremely rude and disrespectful. She talked down to me in a very condescending way. Also, the staff on the plane was rude - I tried to use the bathroom and the flight attendant rolled her eyes at me as if I was inconveniencing her. They also delay flights and make no announcements and give zero information. I also emailed the airline directly and they never responded to me.",-1

When flying spirit in the past I’ve always gone into it with the “you get what you pay for motto” well not today. I’m surprised and happy to say Spirit Airlines - Portland Staff specifically exceeded all my expectations! You book with Spirit for the cheap prices and hope there’s no issues. With it being Friday the 13th we were bound to run into a few. Our flight was from Portland to Cancun with a 2 hour layover in Chicago: I was getting constant updates to my email, that was pushing back my initial flight from Portland to Chicago. Eventually with all the delays due to the weather and a snow storm, the delayed flight would arrive in a Chicago after our flight from Chicago to Cancun would’ve already departed. Cut to the good part, we get to the airport go to check in, with the question “how are you guys doing” stressed I replied with my reasoning behind what happens if our flight doesn’t get there on time. The lady behind the desk (I wish I would’ve remembered her name) was like oh we’ve been expecting you - her manager comes out with two different flights they’ve got lined up for us to decided: the catch it’s through a different airline because Spirit didn’t fly to Cancun again until the next day. Long story short - Spirit booked me and my mom a flight with American Airlines and set us up with great seats: before we left they made sure we were comfortable and everything was good. I was expecting to have to pay for an additional flight, but the Portland spirit staff were preparing for us as soon as they knew we wouldn’t make our flight: very impressed and will definitely fly with them again!",1

Will never use this company again regardless of the lower price offerings vs their competitors. Our flight was delayed by 11 hours of which we had to sleep in the airport on the floor. This occurred at the Fort Lauderdale airport yesterday. When directed to the Spirit counter, I asked to speak to a manager named Helen. After waiting 30 min to be acknowledged by her, she was not helpful and offered nothing. No refund, hotel to sleep in last night, refund for the hotel I booked at my destination, refunds for the excursions that I had booked... absolutely nothing but an annoyed demeanor. When we checked in this morning, we waited in a 45 min line just to be told that our “delayed” flight did not have seats for us as their was a personnel error in transferring this delay. After much discussion, we received a seat. No shower, no sleep, and no compensation for poor service, or a day of our vacation lost. There is no empathy, professionalism, or restitution from this despicable company.",-1

First time I have seen spirit so I figured they must be new that's why they were so cheap as they were for round trip non stop flight for only $165 I thought that's an amazing deal - stupid me thought it was the greatest deal but this is where they get you - if I would have never called them to find out how much there have are to check in I would have to pay $100 for one bag and not to mention you pay for the carry on too I'm like who does that.

My flight departed Vegas at 12pm & we did not arrive on Dallas until 9pm! Due to weather issues they rerouted us mid air to Houston rather than Dallas. They announced it on the over head speaker & told us they don’t know what they’ll do with us. We landed & waited on the tarmac for over an hour till they finally told us we will be flying back to Dallas. This was at like 7pm. I had a connecting flight at 7 so I missed it. When we finally got to Dallas at 9pm (they told us it will take 59 mins to get to Dallas from Houston but they doubled it) I’m trying to figure out what’s going to happen to us but Spirit airlines is so unorganized there were like 4 different lines people were making so I didn’t know where to go or what to do. Finally I just go to the front to get assistance but they only had one person assisting the people who missed flights & like 3 other workers for boarding. I would think that you would want to take care of the people who spent 9 hours on a 4 hour flight & we would have some type of priority but no, they women there refused to help us & we had to wait over 30 mins to get helped. When I talked to the supervisor he was not apologetic or anything. They literally all walked off leaving us there to figure out what’s going on. I had to go find staff to see who’s helping us. I asked for corporates number for complaints (I’m sure they have one cause they suck) he gives me the regular customer service number I already found online. Now I have to fly back to Vegas to fly to Minneapolis & arrive at 6am. Spirit are cheap but it’s not worth it if your are bringing any bags & that includes carryon. Only bag you get for free is a purse or laptop bag. So you think you’re getting a deal till you have to pay $45 there & back for carryon & $65 for a checked bag back & forth. It’s not worth it.",-1

2018-04-11,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Myers,1.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,deserves the reputation,True," Boston to Fort Myers. Spirit could not keep track of my TSA Known Traveler ID. I bought and paid for my TSA Known Traveler ID. I entered my number when I booked the flight. Spirit did not ask for the expiration number, there was no field asking for it. The KT id showed up each time I went to print my boarding pass but it never showed up on my boarding passes. After speaking with 2 Spirit People in Boston, 1 person on the phone (who told me he solved my problem but he did not) I spoke with 2 people in Fort Myers. I went to the TSA office in Fort Myers and they correctly identified the problem as a Spirit Airline problem. In the end the 2 people at the Spirit Airline counter in Ft Myers tell me that they didn't have my expiration date for my Know Traveler Id. Spirit never asked for it nor has any other airline I have traveled in the last 2 years. Furthermore they told me if I could get my expiration date it wouldn't do me any good for that flight anyway. Furthermore no one's KT id has expired because the program isn't old enough! I don't buy the fact that the expiration date is needed, but if there has been some change - no one else seemed to be having the problem I was having and it took me talking with 5 different people from Spirit Airlines to find out that they couldn't do anything. Spirit Airlines deserves the reputation that it has earned.",-1

The seats fit us just fine (we are average height/ weight) they don’t recline but they are comfortable for the just under a 3 hour flight. Customer service was helpful at the busy airport and we checked our bag with ease. We printed out our passes at home (spirit sends an email to help with this). We checked our guitar that arrived there and home in great shape. Will use this airline again. I think if people travel light, print boarding passes at home and are average size (not really tall or heavy) this airline will save money and be a great experience.",1

They charge for everything on board but it is all reasonably priced and of great value. The legroom was not terrible, it was better than I expected it to be, and the seats were comfortable making this 4 hour flight very enjoyable.

Here is my experience: After I booked my first ticket with Spirit Airlines And looked at the reviews I was terrified. On flying with them on three occasions I have had absolutely no problems. All my flights were on time and if there was any slight change of even a minute I was notified. Check in was very smooth and likewise with boarding. The staff were very friendly and I see nothing wrong with the snacks I got either. It's clearly not going to be a 5 star plane with the price you pay! But I seen great value for money with my flight price and I was very happy with my experience. So thank you to all the crew at Spirit Airlines.,1

Why would they wait so long to tell us? The customer service was rude and provided no assistance. Call the 1-800 number and press 5 then 1 then 6 to talk to someone.

She was defensive and rude - kind of nuts too. She said to me --nothing is free--you have to PAY--for everything--your seats! Everything! I said, yes, we have paid for our seats. I was only asking about bags and possibly running into space for the bags w/o prepaying - taking our chances. She said absolutely not. You cannot do that. You pay for everything!

Both the airplane quality and the customer service were poor. The airplane was so bad they had to delay our flight by 4 hours for maintenance. The entire team kept all of the passengers in the dark and did not communicate any information to them. I never take the time to review companies but the quality was so bad I had to pass this on.

If you must have a free drinks and snacks: Spirit is not for you. If you won't pay for a carry on or for a checked piece of luggage, then avoid Spirit because they do charge. If you just want to get from point A to B and don't need the staff to attend to your every need then Spirit may be the choice for you. I like to save a good deal of money. My last flight saved my family over $2500 by flying Spirit. We brought snacks and water. My kids loaded Netflix on their phones and I brought books to read.

I was told at the same time that I could change my baggage on the return online. When i attempted to change the baggage on line it would let me add the checked bag but would not let me remove the carry on bag i had pre-purchased. When I arrived at the airport I explained that I did not have a carry on and needed a tag for the baggage. The attendant knew what I wanted to do but did not seen to be trained to do it like the staff in Orlando was. The computer screen was turned away from me. The attendant put a tag on the checked bag and told me that a credit had been issued for $45.00 for the carry om baggage.

I will first say it is my fault I had my wife plan this flight. She is frugal and picked the cheapest tickets she could find. In any case Spirit has the worst flight comfort I have had in my life. The seats are insultingly small, are fixed and do not move at all. On top of this they charge for every single thing done for or in a flight. On my trip I witness an attendant tell a customer that he could not give him any water except to charge him $3. The man wanted a sip of water for medication. Seeing that I saved myself the same frustration in taking my own meds. I am disabled and noticed they had zero provisions for handling the disabled (slightly larger seating).

2018-03-28,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,the airline of penalties,True," Detroit to New Orleans. My opinion of Spirit has eroded after 3 flights. They may be a good value if you travel with a backpack only, but the value diminishes quickly with luggage. The luggage fees are horrible to begin with and are only priced one-way. I was led to believe that my luggage fee would cover the whole trip. This time around, my suitcase was overweight by 13 lbs., which resulted in a $55 charge at the ticketing counter. My total luggage charge for this trip ended up being $165 for 2 suitcases. The pilots seem competent and friendly, and the cabin crew is adequate. However, not even water is free unless there is a medical necessity. The snack/beverage prices are atrocious. I don't care for this trend of going from a minimal free 6 oz. beverage/crackers to outright exploiting the customer for a can of soda, etc. Nonetheless, I don't ride an airline to eat/drink, and I thought the whole process of wheeling the beverage car out to give everybody a half can of soda was tedious and annoying. Airlines used to make you feel like a valued customer, but now it's like riding a city bus for a lot more money. The attempts to upsell on their website are ridiculous and numerous, and I'm wondering if a traveler saves any money over the big names should they choose all these ""upgrades"". The straw that broke the camel's back today was the fact I had to get in a line to print my own luggage tag before getting in the line to drop the luggage. Why are the ticket agents even there at all? That whole process could be automated. Spirit seems to be the airline of penalties. You're penalized for not checking in from home, not printing your own boarding pass, not paying high luggage fees ahead of time, etc. When you buy your tickets online, you're barraged with choices to pay extra for silly things like choosing your seats (used to be free), boarding faster, etc. I don't like Spirit's contrived a la carte model, nor their uncomfortable claustrophobic seats. I'll not be choosing them again.",-1
2018-03-28,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Detroit,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,5.0,I'm willing to make some sacrifices,True," With just our backpacks in hand my girlfriend and I took the Spirit flight from Fort Myers to Detroit. We've flown Spirit a dozen times and never have a problem fitting what we need in our backpacks to avoid any bag fees. Why others do not do this more regularly is beyond me. Plane was newer and clean, staff were okay, they tried to be friendly. Price was far less than anyone else and it was a direct flight in the afternoon, that's what we wanted. Spirit gets a bad wrap because of all the previous major blunders, so when new flyers try it for the first time and there is any sort of problem they think to themselves ""well everyone told me how bad it was, now I know for myself!"" In reality all airlines cancel flights, arrive late, don't always have the best customer service, and could have more comfortable seats. However when you pay 40-50% less with Spirit than with Delta for example, I'm willing to make some sacrifices. Can't wait until my next trip on Spirit.",1
2018-03-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,mediocre at best,True," Detroit to Minneapolis. I've flown Spirit several times (at least 10 times in the last 3 years), each time mediocre at best but that's the standard Spirit reputation. As we all know or other reviews have said, there's no food, no drinks, the seats seem to get smaller each year, and the only bag you can have is a personal item (which also gets smaller each year). It's always cheap and rarely reliable but you get what you pay for because you get there eventually for a cheap price. I've never understood the people that say, wow I'm never flying Spirit again because you knew what you were signing up for. However, I've finally joined them. The last time I flew the flight was delayed by over 4 hours for no reason given which is nothing new but was a little inconvenient than previous instances. However, good ole spirit gave us a $50 voucher (nice, right?) and I rearranged my schedule. Before we all get too excited let's not forget this is Spirit. The voucher expires in 60 days (reasonable) but you can only use it for the base flight payment (don't forget to read the small print) and there is no way to use less than the voucher amount on the flight. So an exciting voucher that made me think - wow, I've been delayed so many times with Spirit without receiving a voucher but now that I have a voucher, I'll definitely keep flying with them! Turned into wow, Spirit you win again. Long story short, they price their base flight fee right below the voucher amounts to make them irredeemable. No amount of discussion with their phone ""help line"" aka computer that routes you to a person after 10+ minutes of trying to enunciate numbers into a phone will allow you to consent to losing the majority of the voucher if you can just use $5 to $10 of it.",-1

",True," I flew twice with Spirit on a trip to the USA and it was worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Both flights were delayed (one by 10 hours, another by 2.5) due to maintenance issues. I’m all about safety but how infrequently are these planes maintained that they have to do works in between flights? During each delay staff were probably kept in the dark so I don’t blame them but as customers not to know what’s going on and just have the delay pushed back without knowing if the flight will actually leave or not is frustrating - staff even said there’s no guarantee it will take off at all. The first 10 hour delay almost caused me to miss my sisters wedding so I ended up spending 800 USD to fly with United instead so wouldn’t have to wonder if Spirit would get me there. The second delay caused me to miss my connection back to London, resulting in being stuck for 18 hours in Orlando and having to re-book a flight and stay in a hotel. This airline has cost me time and money and the ‘savings’ are absolutely not worth it. After complaining to Spirit they offered a small value flight voucher for the several inconveniences, which is completely useless since I would never fly with them again, even if it were free.",-1

When I landed it was late and I had go through customs plus retrieve my bag. All the Spirit staff at the airport were so useless and basically told me that I was just going to miss my flight and there was nothing they could do about it. When I went to go speak to them at the front desk they weren’t even apologetic, refused to reimburse 100% of my money nor help pay for accommodations even though it was clearly their fault for making me miss my flight. Apparently this happens frequently because there was a girl from another flight crying because they made her miss her connecting flight.

Tried to book a flight for another family member but can't because I'm not flying with them. Worst customer service I have ever seen from a major company, don't care about anything but their profit.",-1

Then after that Spirit proceeded to throw all of these offers at us that seemed great but were total lies. Like you have 2 free round trip flights to anywhere but not mentioning price. Also we have your lunch, dinner and breakfast covered. Literally between me and my GF for each meal giving us a 14$ voucher to eat. Please tell me where you can eat with 2 people for 14$. When we got to our hotel the lady at the front desk called a few local areas about our vouchers. The few local restaurants told us that they don't accept the vouchers, because Spirit has yet to pay them, so these vouchers are sitting at the restaurant as a debt. Literally only thing that pulled through nicely was the hotel. The customer service was horrible. The experience atrocious. Worst experience ever. By the way I'm here now and our morning breakfast voucher for the 14$ they gave us I got told by 3 areas in the airport they are expired.",-1

I haven't even gotten on the plane yet and my 'cheap' ticket costs have practically doubled. Want to carry more than a purse? $45 bucks. Want a seat that reclines? Isn't smaller than all the others? Be prepared to fork over more money! Want to check in with a real person, $10. It's ridiculous.",-1
2018-03-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,it's not worth it,True,"  San Jose to Fort Lauderdale. Spirit Airlines is horrible. I traveled with a group of 4. They delayed our flight from 1:12AM to 8AM without any reasoning. When calling the company, we were always redirected to a different person and nobody was able to help. Someone from Spirit gave us a number to call within the company, and when we tried to call, the number was not in service. When we went to the counter to talk to them in San Jose airport, no accommodations were made and everyone was expected to ""just sleep in the airport"". Passengers had to argue with airline representatives to even get a food voucher. Airline representatives were rude and unhelpful, and even lied to passengers faces saying that ""no hotels were available"" (even though we checked and many hotels nearby were indeed available) and saying that everyone's connecting flights were going to be rebooked. We had to argue and be persistent to be ensured that we had a connecting flight (even though they were so sure we did), and it turns out we did not have a scheduled connecting flight and had to be rebooked through another airline. Only one member of the airline was helpful in our entire experience. When we went to get our boarding passes, we overheard other customers being told that they were unable to get a connecting flight (even though the customers were assured that they had new connecting flights just a few hours before). To compensate the overall terrible experience, we were compensated with measly $50 flight vouchers with Spirit. Needless to say, I will not be using them or flying with Spirit again. Please don't fly with Spirit Airlines, it's not worth it.",-1
2018-03-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines customer review,True,"  Las Vegas to Los Angeles. They boarded all of us onto the plane only to have us sitting on the airplane for over 2 hours waiting to take off. The flight attendants were extremely defensive as to what was going on, providing no update. There was no air flow for the wait in turn, causing a passenger to have a panic attack and escorted off the plane. All while this was going on we were provided no update, plan, or any information regarding why we weren't taking off or when we could expect to arrive. After finally taking off the customers then had to deal with grumpy and aggravated flight attendants. To say the least it was not a good experience. I was then offered a voucher at the counter and was never told that they expire immediately. They apparently expect you to book another flight with them within a month or two of a horrible experience? I called to see if they would let me apply the $50 voucher to the flight I am planning and was hung up on by customer service. I can't believe I even spent a dime with this company or tried for a second time. After the many bad reviews I have heard, it was a mistake I won't make twice.",-1
2018-03-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Fort Myers, Florida to Hartford, CT",1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,This was not acceptable,True," I have flown many airlines through the years and things happen to cause late flights or even cancelled flights. In each instance, the airline was very accommodating and worked with me to get to my destination. This airline did not. There was a nor'easter storm predicted to hit Hartford the following morning of my return trip. My flight was cancelled, which I received in an email so I called Spirit Airlines to reschedule another flight. The only flight available was in another 5 days. I had to be back to work the next day. My total cost, including purchasing seats and 1 carry on bag was $332 and I was reimbursed $136 dollars. This was not acceptable nor was the casual attitude of the customer service rep when I told her I had to be back the next day. ""We are all full"" was the answer and then silence. It's a good thing I can work quickly on the computer because flights were filling up on the screen as I tried to fly back to Connecticut. The one way flight I had to book with another airline cost the same as the round trip flight on Spirit. I had to fly into a different airport in another state, have someone pick me up and go back to Hartford the next day to pay for parking with an additional two days added to the cost. I know airlines cannot control the weather but they should at least try to make their customers want to fly their airlines again by helping them out when cancelling a flight. I also know this is an ""a la carte"" airline but drinks costing $7 with $18 seats that are dirty and an additional cost for a carry on bag added to the list of why I will not fly this airline again.",-1

It’s a company that doesn’t care about its passagers. My flight from Boston to Orlando on 3/9, with a layover in Baltimore, got delayed for more than an hour, supposedly because they were having issues with closing the plane doors. So we had to wait onboard the whole time, and they didn’t offer any accomodations, such as free snacks, for people like me who was waiting to get breakfast at the airport, before boarding the next flight to Orlando, which I almost missed because of the delay and this is not the worst part! My flight back to Boston on 3/12 was canceled due to bad weather. They did not rebook my reservation on the next available flight, and every time I tried to talk to customer service about it they kept moving it further away saying that all flights were full, when I could see on their website that there were still seats opened for earlier flights. It took me almost 2hrs on the phone to finally speak with the manager’s manager, who finally decided to rebook me for an earlier flight. At that point I was just frustrated with their bad customer service and decided to get my refund and rebooked with a different company. Lastly, the savings I thought I was getting was not real, because I paid an additional $60 for my carry on, which is free with most companies.",-1

They do not care about passengers, the only thing they care about is money. We were traveling to Las Vegas for Spring Break and they are poor. Yes, this was the cheaper flight compared to others at the beginning, but they charged so much for extras that it became more expensive. This airline charge money for everything, literally everything. Their seats are uncomfortable and their everything is super expensive.",-1

",True," Spirit canceled our flight from Minneapolis to Ft Myers with no plans for how to accommodate all the passengers on this flight. They offered refunds or attempts at flying standby in the next day or two. They then failed to remove the luggage from the plane. So we bought seats on a different flight however were never able to retrieve our luggage off they plane they had loaded it on in spite of waiting hours. We were told by Spirit to replace the items that we needed and they would reimburse us. I submitted receipts for diapers, formula, etc that we had to replace and they refused reimbursement.

This airline don't care about people. I am a senior with a medical condition and they don't provide any solutions to find a place to stay meanwhile the delayed flight departs.

We were a little late getting to the airport so I cant blame them, even though we were still an hour and a half early, but they still couldn’t get us on our flight. We rent a car for one way travel and drive to Myrtle and then they cancel our return flight for not getting on the departure flight! They say its in the fine print and there is nothing they can do. So we get online and find out that there is 4 empty seats left on the flight that they had cancelled for us but wanted us to pay for two new seats without any kind of reimbursement or discount.

My flight was delayed. I was told the plane would arrive at 920. I was at the gate at 905. I asked if the plane was going to be on time, and was told it had left. When they transferred me to another flight to get to Florida, instead of putting me on the flight boarding right then, they put me on an overbooked flight. I had to watch the staff scramble to find the gentleman who should have been on that plane get a hotel and another inconvenient flight booked for him, before my issue was addressed.

Thought to myself - it's overbooked leave early - so I did. got there, flight delayed. one hour later cancelled. Had I not felt compelled  to assist a blind woman whom I did not know and  who had been left at the gate by airport staff, and was sitting there wondering what to do when the flight was suddenly cancelled and the staff overwhelmed by angry customers, so they disappeared - and no one seeming to realize she was stranded there. I might have gotten another flight, but I elected to assist her and hence I was at the end of the ""rebooking"" (what a joke) line. Hope she  made it to her destination safely. My trip was blown as there is a big storm coming in tomorrow, and it was a short trip to begin with so trying to fly out Thursday would not be worthwhile. Never again Spirit Airlines, Never again. Your staff is beyond rude and uncaring. All of them. Each and every one. I would go as far as saying obnoxious and mean ""spirited"". Never again Spirit Airlines.",-1

Sure the seats are a little crammed even for a person like me who is only 5’2”. Our main complaint is about how our luggage was poorly handled. Immediately after getting off the plane in Tampa, we found our luggage at baggage claim.

We were told it was a staffing problem: Pilot didn’t show up We were supposed to arrive in Fort Meyers at 2:15 PM. We booked another flight with SW and arrived in Florida 2:00 AM, Sunday morning. We lost 1 entire day of vacation. I called Spirit the day before our return flight to MN, and was told that we had no return flight reservations because we missed on outbound flight from Mpls. Are you kidding me! We missed our flight because Spirit cancelled it. They were able to re-book us on the return flight. We went to the RSW airport early in the morning to verify that our flight was still good. We even printed our boarding pass. We went back to the airport 2 hours before our departure time to find out that Spirit had cancelled our flight. We were given two options; Stay another 6 days to fly back on Spirit Get a full refund and try to find another flight home We ended up staying 2 more days and returned home on SW Airlines. This cost us extra money for the return flight, extra days in a hotel, extra meals we didn’t plan for. I was charged twice for baggage that I never checked in because both flights were cancelled. Spirit only has one phone number. This number is busy 24/7. This number is used to verify flight times, book a new flight, change and existing flight and baggage help. This is the worst customer service I ever seen. “Pitiful at best”. Spirit can’t afford more than one phone line?

Spirit Airlines is without a doubt the worst airline in the US. I flew them to Las Vegas in early March from Denver. I had a round trip ticket to fly them back tonight, but they changed the departure time from the one stated on my return ticket. They sent me a contradictory set of emails first saying the flight would be delayed, then on time, and then delayed again. When I arrived at the airport (Las Vegas) they told me that it was too late to board. They had changed the flight time, and told me that my arrival at the gate was my own fault (which it was not). They made no attempt to offer an alternative to return to Denver, and told me they would not refund the money for my return ticket. I would recommend that no one who has any flying experience and expectations for their airline staying on schedule ever fly Spirit.

Their customer service is terrible. In addition, they list their price lower than other airlines but in fact they include numerous different kinds of fees (any luggage, seat selection, anything that you can think of that should complimentary, they charge it) In the end, you ended up 50-100 dollars more expensive than the listed price. Think about it before you fly with this airline. If other airlines are only 100 dollars or less expensive than Spirit, I will go with other airlines. It's not worth it to pay the same price and get a horrible customer service.",-1

The flight itself was to be expected, chair looking seats, not really comfortable. All my clothes and items in my small hand-carry duffle because Luggage is extra $.  But it's cheap, that's the reason we flew with them, right? Spirit calls me the day before, says we're currently taking volunteers because they are downsizing the plane. I asked what will they offer for compensation. They say vouchers for a free round trip flight. I said okay, for a free flight, I can change my plans last minute. I call in before my voucher expires and they said it won't include government fees/taxes and peak seasons. Okay, peak season means holidays right? No, apparently their voucher does not include all Fridays or Sundays all year. I even said I'm flexible with where. LAX, SD, anywhere. I'm just looking for a weekend trip. Nope, can't. You can fly on Saturday and come back on Monday, just not Friday nor Sunday. So I had changed my plans last minute to help Spirit out for a round trip flight voucher I can't even utilize. I said even a $ amount off of my next flight is something I can work with. I'm willing to go anywhere for a weekend, so long as I can come back on Sunday so I'm not skipping work. No, just said no. I'm sorry you're feeling this way, but no. Voucher restrictions are Fridays, Sundays, and all holidays. Kindly asked to be escalated to the manager because this is ridiculous. He said he can't help me because of the voucher's restrictions. I asked for a discount on my next flight, anything I can work with. Then he even had the decency to tell me to be a member if I want to get a discount off my next flight.  If it's the cheapest flight and you got yourself everything you need in a duffle-bag TSA approved. Sure, I get why you'll pick it. But if you experience any  kind of issues along the way? Know that you'll be royally screwed over. In fact, don't even fly with them. Find another one. Pay that extra $30 for better customer service.",-1

After paying for a carry on which other airlines slow for free its more expensive. Don’t be fooled by the initial low cost price, it adds up. Then you get low quality planes and uncomfortable seats. The fight attendants are rude and in accommodating. Stuck on a plane for 4 additional hours denying people even something as basic as water. People try to get off the plane after being told they can do so for 30 min. When every stood up they asked everyone to sit back down. They don’t have enough time and the plane will leave without them. (This still being over an hour till the new take off time) please spirit does not deserve our money.",-1

I told her we kept looking at the board and it never said anything about a gate change and she said that if she couldnt find a flight they would find another airline. She referred me to someone else. This other person looked for a while and said there was nothing else and the next flight to KC would not be until Wednesday 28th. Went to talk to a supervisor. None available so we could pay 574.00 to fly another carrier or wait until Wednesday. So 2 nights stay in a hotel no clothes (they were already in KC) had to go buy clothes, food for 2 extra days.

(There carry on size is decent especially with it being free) I packed 2 pants, shorts, three tops, and two pairs of shoes, undergarments, along with makeup and hair straightener. Both planes were clean with the first flight the seats a bit smaller but not uncomfortable. It was direct flights with a cabin crew that were delightful.

Until you reach to the gate, any confirmation meant nothing - I confirmed my riding twice before I reached to the gate, another girl did the same before she was there in the waiting list line - you know why, unless you pay extra for any seat, you won't get any confirmation. By the end, there are total more than 10 people were overbooked for that flight. Then they distribute what so called voucher - this thing could not be used unless they have anything left could not be sold - meaning if you want book anything later even during slow time, you may not get it. The chance you can get it actually work for you if for example, you would like to book a trip from TX or FL to Vegas and come back the very 2nd day with your family, and that two days are not during spring/summer/winter break, not during any holiday.

The pilot dawdled leaving late arriving late and wasting time taxiing to deplane, we arrived close to the departure time. 10 of us ran to make it in time only to be denied entry. A friend from another flight was on the plane and said her seat had been sold even as she was present. Volunteers were summoned and the other 10 seats had already been sold (of the passengers watching 15 minutes as the plane was to depart). The 10 were rescheduled for next day after being treated disrespectfully because of Spirits own logistics (business model of extortion! We lost a whole day of vacation plus hotels we never made and adventure expenses we failed to show up for. On the return from SJO (2 am) to FLL (gate A) to depart at 7:10 am (gate E). Keep in mind the Spirit logistics allowed only 70 minutes to go thru customs, pick up and recheck luggage and run (literally) a mile to the connection- to find the same situation with 8 passengers in the same dilemma. We were rescheduled for another flight 14 hours later and totally losing a second day. We were told by Spirit authorities is was customs and that we chose the flight, when actually I trusted them to make my experience much less stressful. Honestly, if this happens once on an 11 day trip it is coincidence but twice, losing three days is a business model that deliberately double books seats to the highest bidder and is a sinful way to treat their ""guests""! The FAA needs to stop airlines from using a business model that extorts passengers as ""pawns"" to increase profits. They owe us 2 days of vacation and a day's wage for failing to get us home at 8 am (we'll arrive at midnight now) and spent all day without a shower in a loud, dirty, and brightly lit airport with no sleep! Who knows where our luggage is? The next logistics nightmare? The flight attendants were rude (a guy screaming in a loud voice, ""sit down everyone"" gave the wrong date for customs papers, when asked to use a pen was told in a snarky voice ""I want it back"" The counter puppets are powerless pawns too, the business model uses them as sounding boards for disgruntled customers. They actually have some ""sneaky"" statements they tell us right out of the policy manual!!",-1

It was cheap and that is what this airline is about. Not everyone can afford to fly when they need to, and with Spirit it is made possible. If you want snacks, a comfortable seat and all the amenities than you can go with someone a little more expensive. I don’t kbow why there are so many negative reviews What did you think you were going to get paying $57 for a flight that is a 13 hour drive and you get there in a hour and half. Thats what I paid.",1

The flight was delayed from 6am to 7:30, so we showed up at 6 am and were told, after an hour of no communication, we missed our flight - us and two dozen other people. I posted my previous message and then sent it to Spirit Airlines. They responded by canceling our tickets. After that the ticket agents said there was nothing they could do, and there’s no refund! The supervisor at the ticket counter said it was our fault, and rather than deescalating the situation, he berated us. I asked for his name, and he turned his badge around, saying he didn’t need to tell me. So disrespectful; so unjust! I will forever pay more to be treated with respect from a better company than this!",-1

Great communication by the pilot as we hit some turbulence. I would like to thank the Spirit Airlines crew of this flight.

It seems to be cheaper but there is no free carry on, it is 45$ and has to weigh less than 45lbs or you’ll have to pay an extra 100$. The baggage fees are ridiculous. Also the seats are poor and so much smaller than any other airline I have ever been on. There are no complementary drinks or snacks! Give me a break! Also - when I was waiting in CT about 10 mins before boarding time they tell us they brought the wrong plane! Yes the wrong plane! The plane was too small to accommodate everyone that had booked. Thankfully I was able to get on the plane and make it back home by the original ETA, but a lot of people were not. My advice do not fly with Spirit Airlines!",-1
2018-02-25,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Baltimore Washington,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Worst customer service ever,True,  Seattle to Baltimore Washington. I was flying from a city I didn’t live in with two very sick kids. I received a call around 8:30pm that told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather which I didn’t even believe. All the flights that night from seattle and to Baltimore were on time. I told the lady on the phone that I’m in the airport and will just go to the kiosk in the airport and change my flight there. Turns out Spirit does not even have an office in the airport and the lady didn’t even bother to tell me that on the phone. Standing in the airport for about an hour no one showed up and we had to get back in the rental car which we were supposed to return that night. I called again. This time it was a rude man telling me that the earliest flight would be in 48 hours!! I was shocked staying in a city I don’t live for 48 more hours. I asked the man to see if there are any earlier flights from whatever city near there that I could go and catch the flight (Like Portland). He said no. My husband was simultaneously looking for flights to see if we could cancel this flight and catch another one with another airline. The response was a laugh and telling me the only option I had again and again. Then I asked to speak to a manager. after 20 minutes wait I spoke with a lady who said was the supervisor and then she said oh! while you were waiting the flight in 2 days was also fully booked so the next flight was in 72 hours. At the end I had to cancel that flight in 72 hours because we couldn’t even find a hotel to book online and got a refund of $115 per person and purchased a flight that was 3 times the cost for the next day from Portland. Worst customer service ever.,-1

A supervisor verified that everything I said was true, but since the rep ""corrected himself"" while I was still on the phone that they would not honor the quote. They also refused to refund my ticket. Employees give out answers without verification and then expect the customer to eat the cost. My son was devastated that he can not go with me.

2018-02-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,a last resort option,True,"  Kansas City to Orlando. This was our first time on Spirit Airlines, and will definitely be our last! The slogans they post around the airport should be amended from ""Less dough. More Go"" to ""Less dough. Less Go."" or ""Bare Fare"" to ""Bare Bones."" Our first flight (February 2) was cancelled. It was a 3:30 pm flight, but when we checked in at 7 am, it was already listed as delayed. That continued to be the status throughout the day, but they still had us drive to the airport, check our bags (which we had, of course, prepaid) and sit for three hours as the ""delay for unexpected maintenance"" kept stretching out longer and longer. Finally, they simply said the flight had been cancelled, and 150 of us had to line up to figure out what to do and then we had to retrieve our luggage to haul it back to our house.  We were able to fly out the following morning, but we missed out on time with our children and grandchildren. When we tried to check in for our return flight, we were told that we had cancelled our flight! It took an hour of wrangling on the phone for Spirit to finally acknowledge that they did indeed still owe us our flight back home! And then, we had to wait an extra day (and pay another day of hotel and food) to get back home! We left Orlando and had to fly through Detroit to reach KC. (The original booking was for a nonstop to KC.) On top of this, the seats are too small, too hard, and don't recline at all. The flight was rough, air turbulence not their fault---but it made the ""bare bones"" accommodations even more uncomfortable. The crew pay little or no attention to their passengers, unless you happen to buy a can of soda or a bag of chips. It is definitely a last resort option in our opinion!",-1

Never have I been on an airline that nickel and dimes you so much. Surprised they did not charge me to pee. The worst part was how incredibly uncomfortable the seats are. No padding and they don’t go back at all! Never again. Surprised they are still in business as the price was really high, not cheap, just cheaper than everyone else that day.",-1

Just stay away from it. The price is hidden. Initially you pay so much for a ticket, then $65 for carrying a small suitcase with you each way. Spirit is the worst airline I ever had to deal on all my years of traveling. They are extremely unreliable on over charge baggage!",-1
2018-02-15,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Managua via Fort Lauderdale,3.0,,3.0,,,4.0,4.0,you can really save money with Spirit,True,"  Hartford to Managua via Fort Lauderdale. I had no problems flying on Spirit. I don’t understand why people freak out about the baggage fees and lack of free snacks and beverages. I think they make it pretty clear that Spirit is a budget, no frills airline. If you plan ahead and bring your own snacks and fill your water bottle at the airport, it’s not so bad! They do have snacks and drinks on board if you don’t mind paying. It does feel like a bummer paying for bags but when I added up the cost of the Spirit ticket AND the fee for 1 checked bag, it was still the cheapest ticket that I could find. One important thing to remember is that you can’t bring a normal-sized carry-on (like a rolly suitcase) on board without paying. You’re only allowed a personal item that must got under the seat, like a purse, laptop bag or small book bag. Another thing is that if you’re checking a bag, it’s cheaper to pay for it (both ways) when you buy the ticket. Finally, check in for your flight online to avoid paying $10 to check in at the desk. I thought the staff were friendly, all of my flights were on time and I didn’t have any issues with my luggage. If you want a cushy airline experience, pay more and go with someone else. But, if you learn the policies and are willing to take the initiative and plan ahead, you can really save money with Spirit. Of course, I’m just basing my review off one round-trip flight, so please keep that in mind!",1

I am having issues after issues with them, first I flew with Spirit back in October 2017, flight was delayed for 3 hours, they made passengers sit in the plane and after that asked us to leave the plane, due to some technical problems. After I came back, fighting for this, because I was after my surgery, so you can imagine how terrible I was feeling sitting myself on the plane and then leaving the plane and waiting for another one for 3 hours, they provided with voucher for $100. But when you book something online it says $34, because it covers some portion of the flight, so basically $100 is not even $100 voucher. If you want to have a headache book with them, it is really the worst airline , don't even mention customer service. I cannot even imagine why is this company still in the business.",-1

Spirit is the worst airline I ever had to deal on all my years of traveling. They are extremely unreliable, barely on time, small seat size, over charge baggage, and you have to buy snacks on the flight. Not even if the tickets are free will I ever travel with Spirit again. This is the 3rd time. The 1st time I said I would give it another try, so did the second time and now the third. They also change my seat after I was seated.",-1

2018-02-13,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Las Vegas,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,I enjoyed the service,True,  I travelled Spirit Airlines from San Diego to Las Vegas on 10th February 2018. It was a new airbus only three days old and it had the new non reclining seats. I was able to place my personal item under the seat. I was notified that the flight was delayed 30 minutes. Spirit is a low cost carrier and I am fully aware of what this means. Overall I enjoyed the service and it got me where I wanted to go. The pilot was able to make up time and we actually arrived on time. I will fly Spirit Airlines again.,1
2018-02-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Atlantic City via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,They don’t care about the customer,True,"  San Jose to Atlantic City via Ft Lauderdale. All I have to say about this airline is negative things. Smetimes you feel obligated to catch this airline because is cheap but the stress is not worth it. I been in the airport for almost 12 hours now and I they keep doing is delaying the flight. They will keep saying delay and not cancel so they won’t be responsible to give you a meal or Hotel voucher. I think delaying a flight for 3 days is call cancel if you have to sleep at a airport for 3 days. I call the airline and all they keep saying is I’m sorry, I’m sorry let me see what I can do, they put you on hold and when they return with a respond- they tell you we can cancel your flight and credit your money into your account. WHAT should I do with a refund that takes 5-7 business days to go into your account? They don’t care about the customer at all.",-1
2018-02-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,they are so unreliable,True,"  Denver to Houston. You're playing the odds and eventually, they will catch up with you. I had flown Spirit on 3 previous occasions and had great experiences with them. Everyone I talked to kept telling me about cancellations and delays and that I was crazy to be relying on Spirit to get me where I needed to go. Well, it all caught up with me on my last trip to Denver. On the return flight to Houston, I received an email in the morning saying the flight would be delayed by an hour. No problem. About 30 minutes later I received an email saying the flight would be delayed by 3 hours. Not great, but I can live with it. About 2 hours later I received an email saying the flight was cancelled altogether. By this time most of the other flights back to Houston had been taken by other travellers so I was stuck paying $500 for a one-way ticket through Shreveport, Louisiana and arrived home about 11 hours later. The moral of the story is simply not to book on Spirit Airlines. You might get lucky once, you might get lucky twice, but eventually, you will be left with a lot of inconvenience and expense because they are so unreliable. So that $50 or $100 you are saving on your flight will eventually end up costing you far far more than that. Just don't do it. Trust me, you will be happy you didn't book with them.",-1

The overwhelmingly negative reviews almost scared me off, but I spoke to several friends and family who have flown Spirit, so I gave it a try. First of all, I was well aware that most everything is an ""add on"", that's very clear from their website. The initial price quoted is their bare fare which is for the passenger and one personal item measuring no more than 14x18x8"" which is probably a backpack size. You can add any options or no options, your choice. Read the website. The plane was brand new, very clean and in excellent condition. The seats were comfortable, looked and felt like leather, but of course it was vinyl or something. The aisle was wider than most. The tray table was very small. All food and drinks are extra, so I brought my own on board. The plane departed early and arrived a few minutes early. Very good flight. We booked very last minute at a price that was several hundred dollars cheaper than any other airline. We will most definitely fly Spirit again whenever we can! Huge value for the money.",1

The price is hiding. Initially you pay so much for a ticket, then $40 for carrying a small suitcase with you each way and up to $40 to be able to reserve a seat each way. So with us connecting to go and connecting to return. We paid twice as much as with any other company after all the add on. That is what they mean ""bare fare"" - also we spent 17 hours delayed at the Las Vegas airport because our flight was cancelled several times. They fixed it with offering vouchers. Vouchers are not enough when you have been out of home in work related trip fir a whole week and all you want is to get back to the comfort of your home and family. The delay was due to ""mechanical issues"" after 3 announcements delaying the trip and 5 hours later our flight was finally announced to be Cancelled. Then they sent us out is security to ticket counter to see what they could do to assist us. You don't get refunds easily. You need to e mail and call several times for them to agree to disagree. Please do yourself a favor, just stay away from this airline. Looks like they have some serious issues with the way they manage their business. By the way, we select them based on conveniences of their fly schedules. And that schedule was absolutely re arranged by the airlines. Thanks!",-1

We read so many poor reviews before we left. We were prepared for the worst and it was a terrific experience. Probably paid half price of other airlines and I'll take that.

Spirit Airlines has very uncomfortable seating and are too close together.  My baggage cost was $160.00. Carry on baggage cost makes no sense. Should be shared during the sale of ticket. If the truth be known, with all the hidden cost associated with Spirit Airlines could have flown Delta out of Charlotte, N.C., and saved hundreds. Flight took off one hour late. A Sprite and M&Ms cost $7.00. Took 45 to 50 minutes to get our luggage in Atlanta. My wife and I will never fly Spirit Airlines again.",-1

2018-01-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Ft Myers,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,they changed my fare,True,"  A few days ago I found a fare from Chicago to West Palm Beach. It was $172.55 round trip. I selected it and provided my credit card for the purchase. About 2 hours later I was informed that my fare had increased by $85.00. They did provide me with other dates that would be at my original quote. I was told that the reservation can take up to 24 hours to ticket and within that time frame the fare is subject to change. I provided a credit card based on the flights I selected yet they changed my fare. That's what I call a bait & switch. My experience with other major airlines (UA, AA, Delta) is what I booked is what I get charged. But Spirit has this 24 hour timeframe in place which allows them to arbitraily change your fare if you still want the route you originally selected. What a racket. My advise is stay away from Spirit. Better yet run. Their practices are deceptive. Don't forget about all the add on charges. The cost to carry on you bag is more than that to check it. If I carry my own bag on board am I not saving the cost of a luggage handler. And if you prefer to select your seat ahead of time that will cost you too. You are required to pay for all beverages. By the time you pay for the ticket (at the price they choose - not you) and add on all the additional fees plan on spending about $100 more than what you paid for the ticket",-1

I left my new neck pillow on board and returned 15 minutes later and no one could find the pillow. I spoke with a supervisor and it was too much effort to track it down for Spirit staff.

Spirit please telll me why you would think I would not want to sit next to the person I’m flying with? It cost me $100 to bring back two suitcases normal size, I get there’s a fee but now I’m at $136 extra. We board the plane, get in our seats and from there on it was the worst 3 hrs 45 minute flight of my life, the seats were the absolute worst, uncomfortable, small, could not sleep, could not move! There was no complementary snacks or drinks, everything including water had to be charged to a credit card and it was very expensive, two dollars for a cup of hot tea. No entertainment TVs or movies, I did not save money flying with Spirit after all their hidden fees. Quite frankly I would spend more to be comfortable and able to watch a movie then sit and save $20 by going with Spirit.",-1

Excellent value, smooth boarding, flight and landing, friendly, courteous, helpful staff. I had some trepidation about this airline after reading so many negative reviews but I was very pleasantly surprised. I made sure that (since comfort and legroom are important to me) I purchased one of the “big seats” in the bulkhead of the aircraft, and I made myself familiar with all extra charges ($10 for them to print my boarding pass, $45 for a carry-on, etc). I came prepared with my pre-printed boarding pass and a bottle of water I purchased at the airport. The flight was not full. We departed a few minutes early and landed almost a half hour ahead of schedule. All in all, it was less expensive than comparable flights and, frankly, much more comfortable.",1

Thirteen days later and here I am with no money back, many calls to my bank (TD) and Spirit and TD is certain no money came to me nor is any pending, and Spirit continues isn’t says they gave it to me.

I booked my trip through Expedia. First of all they wanted me to pay for my carry on, it was the correct dimension and it was not overweight, but they only allow you to carry a backpack. Every other airline lets you have a carry on for free. They wanted to charge me 60 dollars for my carry on, of course they don’t tell you that before purchasing your ticket. I showed my military ID and asked them if they have a discount, usually other airlines have discounts on bags. They told me I was wrong and they don’t accommodate military personnel. I had to go to their website and show that they do offer a free baggage check for military personnel. When I did this, the lady gave me so much attitude. Finally after arguing with this lady, I got onboard the plane just to find out we are going to be delayed because they can’t find the co-pilot. My flight from Cancun to Fort Lauderale was late and I had only 45 min to pick up my bags and go through Customs/TSA. I ran through the airport, just as I was getting to the gate, a Spirit worker came on the speaker saying we had 5 min. I ran and saw him go into the doors with 3 min left. I knocked on the glass door so he could let me in, but he just turned around and ignored me. He came back later to tell me he went to close the door and I have to go to customer service. I went to customer service and they told me I won’t be able to get another flight until 6pm the next day. This didn’t work for me because the next day I had a flight to Barcelona at 5.30pm. They told me they can’t do anything for me and doubt I have a flight to Barcelona. I was willing to show them my confirmation with Expedia but they didn’t want to hear it. The only reason they put me on stand by was because I talked to the supervisor. I had to buy a brand new ticked with AA for 371 dollars. I will never again travel on this airline.",-1
2018-01-16,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Atlanta,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2.0,did not even apologize for it,True," Flew Spirit from Baltimore to Atlanta. All 3 flight attendants, not only to me but to other passengers had terrible attitudes on several incidents during the same short flight. Never mind you have to pay for your glass of water or coffee but rudeness should not have to come with the package. In addition to rudeness that seems to be natural to them, one of them pulled his bag out of the overhead compartment, which was above me, and hit me in the head and shoulder and did not even apologize for it - that's normal for them and that's how I ended this terrible flight, arriving close to midnight!",-1
2018-01-15,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,2.0,,5.0,,,4.0,3.0,got me safely to my destination,True,"  Orlando to Cleveland. It was my first time flying Spirit Airlines. They got me safely to my destination on time, and I would fly them again. Newer A320. Pilots were professional. Flight attendants were nice (albeit they didn't have much to do since very few folks bought in flight food). Their web site could not process a itinerary change for me, the system kept being hung up on the seat selection page. I tried it on several different devices with no luck. I had to call in and they made the change for me for no charge. My leg room was good because I was in an exit row. However, the seat bottom was worn and was uncomfortable. I could endure it for a two-hour flight, but any longer would have been really bad. The entire airplane interior looked tired and worn despite only being two years old. Their checked baggage limit is less than other airlines, 40 pounds. This was an issue as both our bags were a few pounds over. We borrowed a portable luggage scale from the hotel front desk (i recommend getting one if you fly these ULCC's often) and maneuvered things to get the weight below 40 pounds. This also meant a trip to the UPS store to ship a box of things home. $30 at the UPS store was a better option than $60+ for two marginally overweight bags. If you understand how their scheme works, you can fly for a low price. But if you add on all the things that a regular airline include for free, the price isn't much less, if at all. If Southwest or a major airline was flying nonstop to my destination, I'd pick them every time. But I'd have no problem picking Spirit again if they were the best option.",1
2018-01-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit was absolutely no help,True," Flew Oakland to Los Angeles. My wife was to take a 1 hour Spirit flight to connect to another European flight. She would have had a 4 hour lay over, which was ok. Text messages started coming in from Spirit pushing the delay time 1/2 to 1 hour with each of the 9 messages. She was also requested to come to the airport at the original departure time, despite the projected delay. It became clear that she would lose her ticket to Denmark if she didn't find another flight quickly. The cheapest additional ticket cost over $400. Spirit was absolutely no help and the only reimbursement offered was 2 vouchers for $50, which she will never use, because she rarely travels on Spirit routes and now has no confidence in Spirit Airlines. The tickets may be cheap, but customer help and fair treatment does not exist with this company.",-1
2018-01-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The delays just keep going on,True, We were unable to make our trip from Boston to Ft. Lauderdale due to Spirit Airlines. We showed up at the airport at 6.15pm for a 8.13pm departure time only to see a notice our flight was delayed until 10.48pm. As that time approached there was another delay until 1.00 am. We were never offered another flight at this time. Then there was another delay until today at 1.30pm because they couldn’t get the radar fixed and they needed to switch out some of the flight staff. Meanwhile everyone has been there for 6+ hours and they offered a $50 credit for Spirit that expires in March! There were babies on the flight also and no one from Spirit was sympathetic or could get us answers. The delays just keep going on and on and all through today with no answers and the next available flight now is tonight at 8.13pm (24 hours later) with no confirmation that will even be available and no assurance that the radar works. There are no other flights we can take and we had to cancel our hotel reservations in Florida. The way Spirit handled everything is unacceptable and it is a horrible airline.,-1

I’ve heard terrible things about spirit and was hesitant to book with them. I flew them twice and I was very happy both times. I just read the emails sent about  10 dollar airport check in fee, the seat fee and the baggage fees. I don’t understand how customers do not read their emails that Spirit sends out multiple times to inform you of their fees. The customer service was fast and friendly and stress free. The inflight entertainment is terrible as there is none but again, they tell you this when you book. Download a movie to your tablet.",1

I drove 2.5 hours to catch my flight from Las Vegas to Pittsburgh, only to get there and wait 4 hours for a delay. Once the delay was up they cancelled the flight at 1am in the morning because one of their crew members didn’t show up to work! Because of this I missed a vacation with my family I had been planning for months! This is absurd and I will never fly this airline again and advise any one else considering this airline to not do it!! They are horrible!",-1

",True," Chicago to Orlando. Horrible, horrible company. Their flights appear to be cheap, yet in reality their pricing causes you to spend way too much money. Not only do they make you pay extra for everything you carry. Their customer service is deplorable, truly depressing. They claim to accept military id, yet when I showed mine they did not accept it and made me pay $55 extra for my carry on bag. Let me specify that my plane ticket cost $60 , so I basically paid my airline ticket twice for 1 bag. This airline is so overpriced it’s insane, I truly hope they change their ways. Please people do not fly Spirit ever! Even if you see the plane ticket and you think it’s cheap, it really is not . Be warned",-1
2018-01-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Boston to West Palm Beach,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1.0,"Stay away, they are not even apologetic",True," Second time traveling with Spirit Airlines and even after a bad experience the first time I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to fly with them once again. This company is horrendous, they were able to make things even worse this second time around. Delayed flights, my luggage (work tools) didn’t arrive until 1.20am the next day at Fort Lauderdale Airport (Trip was to West Palm Beach, so an hour away driving) which cost me thousands of dollars since I wasn’t able to work. Seating inside the airplane for an hour after landing because where they were supposed to park the airplane there was another airplane already there. No water in the airplanes both times I traveled. Imagine? Water being the most abundant free resource not available on their airplanes, you can’t even wash your hands since there’s no water. Stay away, they are not even apologetic.",-1
2018-01-10,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,both experiences were flawless,True," Flew Houston to Denver. Sorry United but Spirit Airlines beat you in every department especially value and planes which are brand new. Can only imagine all the haters are United Mileage Plus members who can’t break their addiction no matter how bad United service gets. Have now flown Spirit twice from Houston to San Fran and Denver. On both occasions I was expecting to encounter some issues but instead both experiences were flawless including on-line booking and check-in, airport service, quality of the planes, cabin attendants, pilots and punctuality which was early arrival for most flights. US seems to finally have a budget airline (sorry Southwest is not budget) where you can build a fare for exactly what you need and all charges are completely transparent. I highly recommend Spirit Airlines and I am the last person who would ‘save’ on airfare if there were any aspects of the experience that were unacceptable.",1

This is the worst airline with the worst customer service. First our flight is cancelled due to bad weather then other airlines took off for that same destination. Then we went to get the next earliest flight and they say it is in 2 days! So now we have lost hundreds of dollars to drive to another airport and buy tickets.

I would not recommend anyone to fly Spirit they give you the impression they are the cheapest but they are not. You have to pay for everything, your carry on, your seats which will add up to be even more expensive than any other flight. Staff are very rude and nasty over an extra half a ounce in your luggage they would either charge you $30 more or you open your bags in front of everyone and take stuff out. Very unprofessional and unpleasant experience.",-1

The staff is rude and terribly disorganized. Lines were long and staff members kept telling us different lines to wait in. The staff members started arguing in front of all the customers. The flight was even worse. The flight crew was extremely unfriendly and as if that wasn’t enough, after a 3 hour flight and a very turbulent landing, the captain comes over the speaker to say we don’t have a gate and it will be at least another 45 minutes. Needless to say, my family and I will never fly this airline again and will strongly discourage friends to not fly Spirit as well.",-1

Flight was delayed, then apparently was on time and they never made any final boarding calls! Bumped from our plane because of it. The on screen still said delayed received an email after the flight was apparently loaded stating flight was on time! And the managers have done nothing! Sure they talked to the agent who said they made the final boarding call but when you have over 9 people saying the same thing and we’re all bumped, it’s your fault! The agent was to busy talking and made no final boarding call. Sat there calling over and over again the gate next to us but not once our flight. And the boarding door never stayed open. Horrible. Can’t even guarantee us another flight until tomorrow. Worst ever customer service - they are rude!",-1
2018-01-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,one of the most aggravating,True,"  Newark to Ft Lauderdale. This airline will entice you on a Orbitz search of being a thrifty find when in reality it is a nickle dime torturous waste of time! They charge you 45$ for a small carry on (and do not tell you ahead of time which typically negates any savings within their price) and to choose your seat. Then, the way they charge for their round trip ticketing is criminal (3/4 charge on the way out and 1/4 on the way back) so when they cancel your return flight (as they did mine) and don't offer a new one for three days leaving you stranded, they will only refund you 52$ on a 322$ flight. Not only has spirit been one of the most expensive tickets I've bought, it has been one of the most aggravating to endure.",-1

The flight was booked at $468.00. Needless to say, we were speechless when we received an email from Spirit asking us to pick our seats and then charging us another $17.00 each for a seat! If you wanted to check bags (which we did); guess what?! That's right - you got to pay them $40.00 per bag for another $80.00. If you wanted any water, you got another bill for $3.00. Our $468.00 flight ended up costing a bit over $582.00! We will never fly this airlines again. I would rather drive.",-1
2018-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia via Dallas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,enjoys torturing its customers,True,"  Orlando to Philadelphia via Dallas. Several days ago I posted a review about our outbound flight to Orlando, where half the passengers' bags didn't get on the plane. Well, here we are again, with my return flight, to start the new year, Spirit Airlines lost our bag once again. I had that sinking feeling as we watched the last few bags and the carousel come to a halt, and no bag. We found an attendant near the Spirit baggage office in Philadelphia, who did not quite know how to take care of the incident. The only thing he was able to do was confirm that the bag had gone to Fort Lauderdale instead, for no apparent reason. He could not seem to figure out how to print us what we needed, because he said he could not remember his password. Then he said the printer was out of paper, so he could not print anything. He asked me to fill something out, which we had to remind him to sign, which at first he was refusing to do for some reason. He said it would probably be coming in on some flight late that night, which we were not prepared to wait all night for at the airport. The airport is in Philadelphia, and we live in New Jersey, so we certainly had to get home. So, today I called and called and called the Spirit baggage office there, to no avail. Most of the time it was a message that said leave a message, then said the voice mailbox was full. And one moment, I got an actual person to answer the phone, who said they had to put me on hold, then after 20 minutes, they never returned, and I gave up. When I called back, it went straight to a recording, which once again said leave a message, then it said the voice mailbox was full. Surprise surprise. If you call the corporate office, all you get are recordings as well, that tell you to write an email, or call the baggage office of the airport of arrival. Obviously that does no good, so it seems we are screwed again. I have been trying all day to reach someone at the Philadelphia Spirit baggage office, and I either get a recording, or someone picks up and says they will call me right back, and they do not. Eight hours of this. I truly believe to the depths of my soul that this organization enjoys torturing its customers. And it does a damn good job of it.",-1
2018-01-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,read all their terms and conditions,True,  Fort Myers to Minneapolis. Beware that you read all their terms and conditions before you book with them. I was supposed to fly to Minneapolis from Fort Myers on 12/18/17 but my son got sick so I couldn’t leave. I did fly on the 22 instead but with another airline instead. I arrived at the Minneapolis airport this morning to fly back to Fort Myers come to find out they cancelled my return flight. I went on line yesterday all day trying to check in under my account and it said flight “confirmed” but wouldn’t let me check in it just keep saying we are working on your flight verify your email address for updates. I received no notification of any kind via email or my Spirit account. So to get back to Fort Myers they wanted me to buy another ticket and another bag check even though I had already paid for them once.,-1

Tried to check in four hours early. Would not let us check in at all more than 3 hours early. Came back and got boarding pass but would not take our luggage because ""there is no place to store it right now."" Paid $52 to check bag and then stuck sitting around for another 45 minutes before we can check our bag. Desk personnel are completely disinterested and unpleasant. Avoid this airline unless you have no other choice because they do not care about their customers. You are just cattle to them.",-1

I wanted to change my return flight to stay in Houston longer. Trying to change the flight was the worst process I've ever experienced. It would take too long to explain it all - but suffice to say - it took numerous calls (about 6 total) to get the correct information and flights and they charged me 3 times for the changes - as if each mistake was my fault. I was in tears by the end of it while still on the phone with the rep. Then I went to purchase my bags online today, and it said my itinerary wasn't recognizable. When I called - and it's no easy task to get someone on the phone - I was told my first name was entered as my last and vise versa.  The most basic info. If I had reversed my names, I would be told I had to buy a whole new ticket! Plus - they keep emailing me to check-in online but no matter what I do - it won't let me check in, and my flight is in less than 24hrs. I ended up paying over $500 for this flight home, and the whole thing has been a nightmare. I would recommend never flying Spirit. Don't be influenced by the cheap fare - you will end up paying way more by the time it's all finished.",-1

I had heard nothing but bad things about Spirit Airlines, but thought hey might as well give it a try, especially for the price. My flight was cancelled due to the power outage in Atlanta, which was not Spirit Airlines fault, but how they handled it definitely was. I was told I could be put on the next flight, ok sounds great. I call to get changed to my new flight (this is all happening on a Sunday afternoon, December 17th.) and I am told the next flight isn’t until Friday 22nd. I was traveling for work and had to be there on Monday and was returning Thursday the 21st anyways. After emailing, Spirit Airlines will not reply anymore. It’s insane, I had to book flights through another airline to get there on time and spent around $1100. Never ever again.",-1

At first I didn't expect a lot from Spirit Airlines but the crew changed the flight. We departed early from Baltimore and arrived on time at San Diego. The crew were really sympathetic and joked during the flight in order to make it faster for passengers. They told us ""don't listen to the comments of other people about the airline because it's nothing but lies"", which was quite funny. One lucky passenger got an extra 5,000 miles for future travel with the company. The only downside was the check-in machine, which didn't work correctly. I recommend this airline for people who want to fly for cheap with not many baggages.",1

The employees were rude. Asking a question “when will the flight board and depart?” The employee at the gate did not even look up and mumbled an answer that I couldn’t here. I paid for my bag according to their policy and then witnessed over half of the passengers carry on bags not tagged. The agent never even looked or inquired.

I will never fly them again and wish I had never taken the flight.  Everything they say about customer service being horrible, uncomfortable seats and nickel and diming you is true! I booked a flight to get to San Diego Christmas day and after paying for my seat, my luggage and check in fee was waiting in the airport. 1st hour passes after take off and the plane is delayed. Second hour passes and the plane is marked delayed. Then an attendant gets on the speaker at the airport and announces, ""Once again, if your on the flight to SD your plane has been cancelled. Please see the customer service desk for accommodations. The next flight to SD is tomorrow."" Tomorrow? Tomorrow is not Christmas. Once again? When did they say it the first time.  I finally got to the counter at the gate and was told they could not help me and that I should to go to Customer Service desk as instructed. This was Christmas day and I just wanted to make it in time to celebrate with family and instead I am stranded and dealing with rude Spirit employees. I ran over to Southwest Airlines that was in the same terminal and was able to book a flight to SD thankfully. The very friendly SW Agent told me to go back to Spirit and ask for luggage that was already checked in so it could travel with me. I went back to Spirit and asked them for my luggage. ""We certainly don't have it here. You will have to get it from baggage claim"", I was told. I asked if they could get it and was told no that I would have to go get it. So I had to run to baggage claim, leave the secure area and pick up my bag which was just sitting there. I then had to re-check in through TSA and get back to the SW gate before the flight took off. I happily made it home in time for Christmas. I contacted Spirit for a refund for my flight which cost $200, seat charge at $33 and luggage charge/check-in at $52. I felt this was fair since they cancelled the flight. After two days, I got an e-mail from Spirit. I did not receive a refund, I instead received a $50 Sorry voucher to be used on Spirit, just to add insult to injury.",-1

My boyfriend was zone 1 and I was zone 4. They called zone 1 and most people got up to board. I waited for them to call zone 4 and they never did. I walked up to see if I could board yet and they said they gave up my seat. They were super desperate to give up seats because they announced numerous times that the flight was overbooked by 4 seats. I watched my luggage and boyfriend take off and was sitting right there the entire time. Also every customer service line/person at desks at the airport, would not help me rebook a flight or anything. Nobody in Spirit was of help or cares at all as I began to cry at how unfair the whole situation was. I’ve flown numerous times but never Spirit. And never again. The dollar matters way more than any person. This reminds me why I usually fly delta or southwest, real airlines with morals.",-1

We end up paying $217 total, $52 for checking luggage and then at gate this women sent us back to pay for our handbags. I'm never  going to travel Spirit Airlines for its truly disrespectful and untrained staff. On the way to boarding the flight again another women came and put tag on one of our handbags and told me this bag you have to pay, I said I already paid she goes oh let me see your boarding pass. At least the staff should be trained to read receipts. Cheapest flight literally and cheapest way of making money out of unsuspecting victims.",-1

Gate closed 15 min before departure and if you arrive at the gate within that time, you will find no one at the gate and the door closed. No consideration even when they are notified by the ticket agent that you are on the way. Ticket did not get credited or was I offered a rebooking. I lost 400 dollars on my flight.

While one of the worst airlines I've ever used, including a horrific experience 10 days ago that landed me on Alaska Air to San Diego, this particular flight was relatively worry free. The service at bag check, boarding, and inflight were good. The seats however are the least comfortable of any domestic carrier. I'm willing to sacrifice some comfort for price, but I'll never choose to be that uncomfortable again.",-1

Once again, Spirit has found a way to destroy any hope of us and our kids enjoying a trip. Today, Philadelphia Airport was a mess in general, but the Spirit counter took the cake. By the time we finally got to the counter, we checked our bag, and we could see behind the attendants that the bags were just piled up haphazardly with no progress. We even joked that there was no way those bags were getting on our plane. And we were correct. The Spirit flight took off and apparently left 40 or 50 passengers' bags behind. Unforgivable. How could an airline that has the audacity to charge $50-$100 + per bag not make certain it has at least a majority of the bags on board? Stupid. They would rather have the 50 or so angry passengers causing chaos at the destination, Orlando airport. Only after waiting in baggage claim for over an hour with NO information or announcement provided to let the passengers know what was going on. We finally called Spirit (By the way, you apparently can only get a real live person on the phone if you pretend to be making a new reservation), and were told to talk to the baggage office at the airport. Time will only tell if we or the other masses will ever get their bags. Till then, we need to buy new clothes, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and toiletries. And may have lost our specially-made Disney shirts. They offered us a $25 voucher on our account if we ever fly with them again.",-1

Staff is rude, unfriendly and very slow.  Long queues especially for kids because they cannot be checked in online. Didn’t know how many people were on board which delayed the flight even more; and this in these times where everybody should stay on top of security. It was an unbelievably bad experience - so annoying and frustrating. I’d recommend to pay staff by checked passenger per time unit and customer sat. Then they will get their back up and run.",-1

This airline is just as bad as the bad reviews allege. Most of their staff are rude and unfriendly, and act like they are doing you a favor to accommodate your requests. Flights get delayed, no expressed efforts to make sure connections happened, no seeming interest in service, and what’s worse, they aren’t really much cheaper than other airlines, when you account for all their other hidden fees. Moreover, many of their positive reviews are not wholly different and sound suspiciously like their advertisements. Going elsewhere for sure!",-1

We flew Spirit Airlines a couple of times during our trip in the States. Flying/dealing with Spirit was the worst experience I’ve ever had with any airline. On our first flight, we were required to pay all these little hidden fees, luggage over by just a few grams - required to pay more $$$. The customer service was terrible. The plane was uncomfortable. I’ve flown budget airlines before but this was just shocking! We had to cancel our second flight with Spirit as we did not want to risk flying into Florida with the Hurricane. I have emailed Spirit several times requesting we receive the refund back monetary rather than credit note. They did not respond to me initially, I sent several emails and rated their response as poor before I got one email reply where the customer service rep didn’t even attend to my issue/query! I’ve emailed them several times again, and NOTHING. We are from Australia so we don’t anticipate coming back to the States anytime soon to use those credit notes. They also have an expiry on them (they may already even be expired). The customer service is terrible. The planes are terrible. The airline overall is terrible. Will never book with them again and I highly stress to others don’t book with Spirit. In the end, you don’t save much at all after paying all their fees, and it’s not worth the headache! If I could give this airline 0/10 I would.",-1

I flew to MSY from CLE in October on a major airline for $600 and that was with one layover at a total flight time of 5 hours. Today (12/21) I flew Spirit non-stop from Cleveland to New Orleans at a roundtrip ticket of $280 and that’s including a $93 surcharge for my desire to have the first seat from the cockpit. I read all the horrid reviews before flying so I was expecting a sardine can with wings filled with degenerates. Well let me just say that was one of the most pleasant and most comfortable (and by far the shortest) flights I’ve ever experienced in my 38 years of flying.

Nickel and dime you to death. Ok you are probably thinking is it really that bad? The price is so cheap. I'm here to tell you don't do it. Cheap flights are nothing if you never get to your destination. Summary: total round trip $96 from ATL to BOS -I got to the airport and they couldn't seat me on the plane and told me they can give me another flight the next day or if I need to get the the destination the same day, then fly with another airline. Cost for same day one way ticket from another airline $212 (actual cost). Ok at this point assuming I have a flight back with them I went to check in for the return flight. Guess what? They canceled the whole trip and told me my ticket was forfeited. Offer to re_book me for the same seat I already paid for for an additional $180. I'm not giving then more money. cost for another same day ticket back to ATL with another airline $220. So if you followed me this far here a summary of my total actual cost because I made a mistake of flying with Spirit Airlines. Initial cost: $96 additional outgoing one way cost with another airline-$212 additional return one way cost with another airline-$220, Total $528. So my cheap flight initially went from $96 to $528. If I booked with another airline in ATL round trip would have been around $180. So fly with them if you don't care about schedules, don't care about getting to your destination, don't care about being stranded, don't care about losing money, and don't care about pretty much anything then please book with them.",-1

But after my last trip, I will never fly Spirit again. And here is why. Upon our original check in from Detroit to Cancun on December 7th 2017, as always before, my boyfriend and I had our Spirit (new size bags) and purse. We were told that we have to pay $65 at the gate for both of these bags, because we were allowed only one personal item with us. It was never a case before. We paid, and while we were eating we were listening for our flight's updates. First it was on time, shortly after it was a slight mechanical issue delay, next our flight was cancelled due to new regulations. Pilots have to have uninterrupted 8 hours sleep. Our flight was rescheduled for the next day, December 8 at 7.20 am. As a result we lost 1 day of our vacation here. On the way back Spirit did it again to us. Only this time it changed our flight to 5 hours earlier. Thank goodness we printed our boarding passes the day before and the not same day. We would of missed our flight all together. I think many people did. When you are on vacation in Mexico you dont check your emails. So, instead of leaving our hotel at 2 pm we had to leave at 9 am. Because of Spirit's cancelling and changing of our flights we lost one and a half days out of our 5 vacation days. With all the extra fees for bags and emergency seats (which they did not honor on our connecting flight), lost vacation time, in total our personal damages Spirit cost us over $1000. All what they offered to us for our ""inconvinience"" was 4 vouchers for $50 each in order to book more flights with them (lol) before 02/2018. After our last experience we will never fly Spirit again because they are unreliable, unconcidered, rude, their business practices are built on scaming and deceiving their customers. They dont have enough staff to fly their scheduled flights because they dont keep enaugh staff on call to acomodate cancelled flights due to new regulation of mandatory 8 hours sleep policy (they are cheap!) like Delta does. So, goodbye Spirit and hello Delta.",-1

Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,We were left stranded in Chicago,True," My wife and I joined my college-age son on a trip from Chicago to Peru this past summer. Spirit Airlines not the airport, not the weather, not a mechanical issue cancelled our first leg with less than 4 hours notice from departure with no explanation and would not help us in any way get to Miami to catch our connecting flight to Lima. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes to speak to a rep who told me he was based in the Philippines offered to re-book us to Miami 2 weeks later! Spirit had another flight to Miami that night and could have bumped one of those passengers with no connecting flight to catch. We were left stranded in Chicago and left on our own to get to Miami by 6 am to catch our connecting flight to Lima at 6 am. We had to drive 90 miles north to the Milwaukee airport to get the only flight on a different airline that could get us to Miami in time. This was a huge additional cost. It took Spirit 4 weeks to refund the Chicago to Miami leg. Then they tried to charge us an upcharge for checking a bag at the Lima airport instead of online when there was no option to check a bag on their stupid website in Peru. And boy I tried a bunch of times. Finally, my wife needed water to take her medications on board and they wanted to charge her for water to take her medications! But ""A cup of ice is always free."" Do not expect any sort of courtesy or caring service from this unscrupulous carrier. Never again will we fly Spirit. By the way, their frequent flyer program deletes all you earned miles every 3 months unless you get their credit card in which case you must make a purchase every month to keep your miles alive. This in my experience is the worst miles program in the industry - the odds stacked against the passenger. Good luck finding the fine print and information you need on their website, in waiting on hold an average of 30 minutes to speak to someone who will be of no help anyway and good luck in using those earned miles. Seats are hard plastic with vinyl cover. Its no value for your money when your flights are cancelled and you have to pay double at the last minute to another carrier.",-1

We flew from Costa Rica to Dallas TX with a connection in Fort Lauderdale FL. It was the worst experience ever, when we arrived in FL for our connecting flight to Dallas we had to go thru customs, immigration, baggage pick up and re-check. Our connecting flight was only 1hr after our arrival and of course we were not able to make it on time and the airplane left us behind, it took them about 3hrs to get all the people with the same problem on another flight, they were very rude and unprofessional, gave us some meal vouchers that could only be used in Fort Lauderdale but we were transferred to Miami airport where we had to wait 16hrs. I requested to talk to the manager since the employees were very rude, all I was asking was for the voucher to be valid in Miami Airport and all I was told was buy your food here, there was nothing they could do about it. They were very rude and unprofessional. On top of that they didn't mention anything to us about the baggage fee that had to be reimbursed and when I asked about it the rep was mad about it and gave us the $ back but acted as though it was our fault. We finally were transferred to Miami airport leaving with the worst experience ever. We were not the only ones with the same problem there were tons of people having lots of issues and every rep was very rude.",-1
2017-12-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this scam to stay in business,True," My Spirit Airlines flight from Tampa to Cleveland, Ohio (Flight 178) on Saturday (12/09/2017) was canceled due to weather but there was no snow, storm or any bad conditions that would cause a flight cancellation. As a matter of fact I checked and no other flight to Cleveland for that day was canceled. They offered to send me on Tuesday or refund me. My refund was only $28 out of $250 that I paid for round trip. They claimed my ticked price for return was $28 and they didn't refund what I paid for my seat, my baggage or any fees. Spirit uses this scam to stay in business and that is how they can offer lower prices. A plane full of people, about 300 or more, were stranded just so Spirit can make money. I had to pay $180 for a car rental and drive 20 hours to get home.",-1

With the outrageous seat prices and additional fees as well as very poor customer service, this is anything but a budget airline.

The gal at the counter didn’t see the words “thrills combo” on my receipt and didn’t know what it was and wouldn’t bother finding out.

I was 45 min before departure time (on top of that the flight was delayed) and there was an interesting group of people, complaining that they could not get the boarding passes. Few minutes later, we found out that out reservations were canceled and seats were sold to other passengers. That day, Spirit Airlines decided to make a 2 hour preflight boarding. We based on their rule, were late and could not get on the plane. That is just a half of the story, as we were marked as a no-show, our tickets back were also canceled with no refunds or other alternative options. The worst customer service I ever experienced!",-1

2017-11-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Miami to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,we were forced to rebook our flight,True," I write this review in chronological style to make it easier to comprehend what a terrible customer experience I have with this rock-bottom tiered airline company. Our flight was scheduled on thanksgiving day to Houston, departing at 7.07am. We attempted to check-in our bags after checking in at the Kiosk before the nonsensical 45-minute cutoff time. After reaching the counter to check-in our bags, the lady tells us that we are a minute late, meaning, 44 minutes early before departure; thenceforth a series of events occurred that compelled me to write this review. I tried to reason with the lady at the counter that we checked-in before the cut-off time at the kiosk, and that we have every right to board that plane, especially if it’s still on the ground. After five exhausting minutes of arguing with the unqualified (in every aspect of the word) lady at the counter, she mentions that our seats were given to other people that had checked-in prior to us, because of their overbooking policies. Infuriated, and trying to remain even-tempered, we were forced to rebook our flight to the following day, and advised to stay on stand-by for a same-day flight to Houston later that day at 6.55pm. Given the situation, I was skeptical and impervious to persuasion of being able to board that flight later on that day because of thanksgiving. The lady at the counter insisted that we should definitely be able to board that plane as standby’s because ""the plane is big, and you’re #1 in queue"". What she didn’t say was that the flight was oversold, meaning that the people who didn’t have any seats would be priority. I made a regretful decision to believe her, since I didn’t want to miss out on spending thanksgiving with my family. I thus waited 12 hours in the airport just to be told, in a condescending, and self-absorbed tone, that the flight was oversold, and there was no way I could board this flight, despite being first in queue as standbys. So thank you Spirit, for not letting us board that plane to Houston because I was a minute late to check-in my bags. I spent a very ironic “thanksgiving” day in the airport waiting 12 hours hopelessly trying to make on the next flight to Houston, all at the direction of your employees. The next day I boarded on the rebooked flight, and was forced to wait on the plane, along with 100 other people, 30 minutes for one of your tardy employees to board the plane. But you couldn’t wait one minute for a passanger to check-in his bags, on thanksgiving. I ended up paying $400 dollars more than anticipated because of ridiculous carry-on fees and rebooking fees, and wasting a whole holiday at the airport in vain. I wish not this service on anyone, since it’s better to suffer injustice than to do it.",-1

He was blocking the Isle during boarding then getting upset when people did not move out of his way. He was then in people's faces doing the ""be quiet gesture"". While waiting with my 3 year old daughter to use the restroom he yelled at us to wait in our seat (the seat belt light was off and my daughter could no longer hold it and ever ytime we would get up, someone would beat us to the restroom) after 2 times of missing the restroom we waited by the door. After using the restroom, my daughter and I are trying to return to our seats and he is blocking the way (he has a beverage cart, that we could get around but he would not move himself over to let us by) he then yells at me again because there was a flight attendant behind us, I told him "" I am not sure where you would like us to go because you are blocking the way trying to fold papers into birds ignoring the fact that we need to pass you by"" he still would not move over so I helped my daughter pass as far as I could with my arms to be sure she didn't fall and then I had to force my way past him (still would not move over) to return to my seat.

And at that point the only that I was continuously told was ""I am sorry"" by the ticket counter agent, supervisor at the ticket counter, and the Spirit customer service. Totally unacceptable!

My husband I gave up our seats  because they over booked their flight, and they told us that we could get two free tickets each to anywhere Spirit Airlines flies and any time - as long as it’s booked in the next year! So the vouchers they gave us had to be booked within 60 days of our last trip and so we attempted to book tickets, but what they don’t tell you you is that they have specific times the voucher passenger can use them, the second thing was they don’t have flight time available in July or August. So the wonderful vouchers they say they are giving you is a bunch of nonsense - unless you can accommodate to their specific time of the month. So thank you for nothing Spirit Airlines ... glad we could help you out when you overbooked flights. We now get nothing! We will never use this awful airline again.",-1

After staff asking for volunteers to give up their seat for a credit, room credit, etc. I went up to the front to offer my daughters seat because she was not traveling with me today. Instead of being offered a credit I was told if I was cancelling her seat I would need to pay a cancellation fee! Supervisor on duty was opposite of helpful.",-1
2017-11-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,it is the hidden rip-off,False,"  I  fly on regular basis and today I am flying Spirit Airlines from Boston to Fort Lauderdale and to my surprise I was charged $55 for carry on bag. Because this is Spirit Airlines standards my option was $55 for carry-on or $50 for check in so I chose carry on $55.00. I have never heard of such a thing and today will be my last flight with Spirit because this is not industry standards. Every other airline you are allowed one carry one. I bought my ticket online and this was never listed up front on the website (expedia) telling the buyers of this $55 rip off. I'm not upset about the $55 dollars, small change for me, it is the hidden rip-off.",-1
2017-11-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LaGuardia to Chicago O’Hare,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I am highly disappointed,True," Spirit has the worst service ever. After arriving to the gate (by the way, for some reason Spirit’s gate is always the last one in any given terminal), we had to wait for over 2 hours watching the desk attendant delay the flight departing time over and over again before they finally cancelled the flight. When we asked they gave us no specific reason other than ""we don’t know"" and asked passengers to exit the terminal and to go back to the check-in counter for more information. Once there, they didn’t know either and they said the only options available were to either return our money (which takes several days to ""clear"") or to put us on the next day flight (same time) with no guarantees at all (we asked) the flight will depart. They did not offer and when we asked they said Spirit will not pay for any kind of accommodations. I am highly disappointed and will urge anyone not to flight with this airline. Even if you have to pay more is not worth the risk of having to stay overnight (Sunday to Monday) at LaGuardia, NYC!",-1
2017-11-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Santo Domingo,3.0,,3.0,,,5.0,5.0,airline I would consider taking again,False,  Chicago to Santo Domingo. I expected the worst. But I did my research before going to know exactly what to expect. It was an airline I would consider taking again! We went during hurricane season which also freaked me out but we ended up missing the hurricanes and none of flights were delayed. We were actually ahead of schedule. I brought my own snacks and bought a drink from the airport before boarding flight. I brought my tablet with movies. It wasn’t bad. I had one flight attendant who was rude and didn’t want to share a pen when filling out paperwork to get in customs I recommend bringing a sweater to use as a blanket. Use a backpack for your carry on so you don’t have to pay for it. Check your bags when you do early check in online then you don’t have to pay extra.,1
2017-11-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Fort Myers,,,,,,1.0,1.0,a waste of my time and money,False,"  Chicago to Fort Myers. The  worst service I have ever encountered while flying. Boarding services would not let us board the airplane even though the door was still open & a family was boarding right in front of us. The person calling those to be boarded did not call our section twice and could not enunciate his words when announcing it the first time, so it was completely incomprehensible. When asked he refused to let us on the plane even though we had been in the terminal for over an hour and approached the desk before the 15 minute time limit. I have never had someone be more rude and dismissive towards me. Even thought I’m an adult the employee assumed I was a child and treated me as such, demeaning me. He said he could not let us on because of “policy” but maybe the employee should have remembered his training when calling the different zones and giving a 15 min warning until boarding closes. If you follow your policy you should follow your training or maybe the employee needs to review his manual. I will never be flying spirit airlines again and encourage no one to ever fly with them. I have never been so disappointed and offended in my life. This was a waste of my time and money.",-1
2017-11-17,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Minneapolis,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,5.0,everything was great,False,"  Atlanta to Minneapolis. I was very nervous and slightly skeptical to fly Spirit after some of the reviews that I had read. For me, the price of the flight was just too good to pass up. To my very pleasant surprise everything was great! The planes are pretty small and everything carries an extra charge, but It's a budget airline so this is to be expected. If you're a light packer and bring your own water or soda, this is perfect for you. I could get my extended weekend's worth of close in my personal item bag and I found the staff to be very friendly. On our flight home there was a tray table issue that delayed our flight from taking off on time, but the pilot was very informative and provided great updates throughout the process. I don't have a bad thing to say and will definitely fly them again in the future.",1
2017-11-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Dallas Fort-Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience I've had,False,  The worst experience I've had with an airline. First we go over to the counter where at least 15 employees were standing around talking and I had to interrupt them to get their attention (after standing there for a few mins). After the lady copped an attitude toward us because we interrupted her story she kept telling us we had to use the kiosk (it wasn’t working) and then we had already paid for a carry-on with our tickets but we had to pay again. And then our bag was 41 lbs so we had to pay an addition $30! I will never be flying Spirit again.,-1
2017-11-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,baggage fees are outrageous,False," Worst airline I have ever dealt with - I will never fly with Spirit or recommend business travel with this company. Flight was delayed from 6:45am until 1:00pm, causing a missed connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale, FL to Jamaica. No one at the ticket counter could help, no one on the customer service phone line could help. In the end after waiting on the phone for over an hour, they wanted to offer a $50 voucher to be used on their airline. However this would be useless since I will never use Spirit. Not to mention how everything is a money grab with this company, bare-fare is a joke, because if you want to guarantee you sit with your children or family they make you pay for chosen seats, and the baggage fees are outrageous. They even make you pay if you print your boarding pass at the ticket counter. After all this, you dont even get a complimentary sip of soda on the plane.",-1
2017-11-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Minneapolis,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,Customer service was garbage,False,"  Los Angeles to Minneapolis. Spirit Airlines is probably one of the worst airlines I have ever flown on. Customer service was garbage, they never assisted in a way they made me feel like an appreciated customer. They provided vouchers that were completely useless, unless I wanted to pay even more money to this garbage airline. However, the flight service members were adequate. This is the only good thing about this airline.",-1
2017-11-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Myers,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Most unfriendly staff ever,False,"  Boston to Fort Myers. Most unfriendly staff ever. The TSA employees were friendlier than the women at the check in counter. However, I can deal with subpar employees, what's a tough pill to swallow is when you are told your outside of their 45 minute check in window by 10 minutes but you're waiting in line for over 15 because they have one woman working the counter. So 99 dollars later and an 8 hour wait in the airport for the next available flight was my option. Airline is a joke. Pay the few extra bucks for another airline that won't screw you over.",-1
2017-11-11,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,waited 3 hours to find flights,False,"  Los Angeles to Ft Lauderdale. The flight was canceled at 10:47 pm after showing on time. Other passengers and myself waited 3 hours to find flights to get us to our destinations. No hotel vouchers were given and instead of reaching my destination at 7 am, the flight is scheduled to land at 2:55 pm and as a single woman the airport is where I will sleep.",-1
2017-11-10,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Dallas Ft Worth,5.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,was a very good experience,False,  Oakland to Dallas Ft Worth. It was a very good experience to travel along with my wife on Spirit Airlines on 8 November 2017. Our seat numbers were 5A/5B. The seats were comfortably spacious with adequate reclining and neck supporters. The leg room was quite good enough to stretch legs comfortably.,1
2017-11-10,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,3.0,Both flights were on time,False,"  Flew from Philadelphia to Las Vegas with Spirit Airlines. I had read so many bad reviews but I had to fly cheap. So since it was almost half the price of the other airlines I took the chance! Both flights were on time and it was like a bus. If you are in a tight budget and don’t care about food and service or a space for your lap, take Spirit!",1
2017-11-10,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Tampa via Baltimore,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,10/10 would use them again,False,"  Boston to Tampa via Baltimore. I was extremely skeptical to go on this trip. I booked Spirit because of the price and only realized afterwards the reviews and such on it. I have to say that it was one of the most pleasurable flying experiences, especially for the price that I paid. I flew From Boston into Baltimore, had a 30 minute layover, and was leaving Baltimore to fly into Tampa. That 30 min layover made me extremely nervous too. Not only could we have been delayed, but I would have been stranded in Baltimore for who knows how long. Each flight departed right on time and arrived at least 10-20 minutes early. The staff were superb. On my first flight, they were giving away 5000 traveling miles and another 5000 if just filled out some paperwork. On my second flight, the pilot came on and introduced himself, told some funny jokes, explained that we were in good hands as he had been flying for 37 years, and did a great job. The cockpit crew did a great job of keeping us updated by coming on multiple times during the flight with ETAs, temperatures, and their expectancy for any turbulence. Honestly, if you do your research beforehand, you don’t get charged anything extra or run into any unexpected issues. The seats in economy are a little close, but they’re not horrendously close. They’re not the most comfortable things, but if it was all about comfort, i would have paid the extra for the extra room and comfort seats up front or flown first class somewhere. 10/10 would use them again.",1
2017-11-10,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Detroit,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I would recommend them,False,  Orlando to Detroit. I had to travel unexpectedly due to a terminal illness in the family and I was impressed by professionalism of the staff. The help that I received was excellent even though I flew economy and I am now a loyal customer thanks to an awesome team of managers and excellent customer service representatives. I would recommend them.,1
2017-11-09,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,have nothing to complain about,False,"  Flew Los Angeles to Chicago. It was our first Spirit experience. Got a bit nervous after I booked as I started reading reviews. I fly a lot for my work (domestic and international) and I must say, great experience. Maybe we got lucky, but have nothing to complain about. Flight was on time, love the new and clean planes (compared to many other US domestic flights/airlines), extremely friendly and funny cabin crew, great communication and updates before and during the flight. All the people complaining about additional costs for luggage, food etc.. start reading, it is all communicated clearly on their website and during the booking process. How else do you think they can manage to be low cost? Again, maybe we got lucky but had a better experience than on most domestic flights with traditional 'big' airlines.",1
2017-11-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,staff is extremely rude,False,"  Newark to Fort Lauderdale. At first this airline seems attractive because they are so cheap, but you will go through a nightmare flying with them. They are constantly late. They change departure time back and fourth several times a day. Their representatives are rude and unprofessional. If you show that you are unhappy the staff will treat you like dirt. On November 6, 2017 we had checked in for a flight that was an hour delayed and had our bag checked. The staff unchecked our bag and told us we had to take the next flight because it was already closed - despite having checked us in already it behind there well more than an hour before the flight. The staff is extremely rude. They don't care for the people at all and use their position to show who the boss is. They literally closed the doors to the plane on us because my husband had to urgently go to the bathroom. Being 4 months pregnant and having waited 5 hours in the airport for the next flight, I had to publicly beg the 2 young girls on duty to not close the gate and wait 2 minutes for my husband. They eventually let us in, but I still can't believe that a patron can be treated with such disrespect. If you want to be treated with dignity, stay away.",-1
2017-11-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,better off avoiding this airline,False,  Phoenix to Fort Lauderdale. Would have been cheaper to fly a better airline. Extra fees at every turn! Horrible seats that leave you needing a chiropractor! Never will we fly with Spirit Airlines.  Treat passengers like cattle headed for slaughter. Thought we saved money by flying Spirit Airlines but in the end it costs much more. Everyone is better off avoiding this airline if at all possible.,-1
2017-11-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Dallas,1.0,,5.0,,,5.0,1.0,"No more Spirit, no more Cheapoair",False,"  Phoenix to Dallas. I booked a ticket from Cheep O Air for 10/26/2017 to 10/30/2017. Both red eye flights. Within days I found I had been given the wrong dates by my son for the Formula 1 race in Austin, TX. I then had to change the flights dates to exactly the same times, same flight numbers a week earlier. I new there would be a cost to this, but not what I expected. I paid initially 118.38 for the flight, then when it was changed, cheapoair charged me 25.95, I guess for the change on their end, but Spirit charged me an additional 130.00 for the change. This totaled 248.38, almost double the original amount, for the same flight, same flight number and same times. For an airline that you can't even adjust your seat back. No more Spirit, no more Cheapoair. Unacceptable.",-1
2017-11-06,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Philadelphia,3.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,"for a low-cost carrier, 5 stars",False,"  I had heard that Spirit Airlines was as bare bones as they come, just a non-refundable place on an airplane to put your body. My adventurous side combined with the much cheaper price made me try it anyway. For our first scheduled flight, the TSA decided that my wife, a young mother traveling with a baby, was a security threat and needed extra checking. (While our baby screamed, of course.) After all that, we got to the gate after it was closed, and the plane took off with our luggage and carseat aboard. Spirit offered us the next day's-Friday's-flight, but we couldn't take it because it would land on Sabbath. (We ended up flying American). As a one-time courtesy Spirit gave us credit for the value of the missed flight. (Much less than what American charged us). On the way back I found the seating space just as roomy as any other airline, although perhaps less comfortable. I didn't use any entertainment. All-in-all, for a low-cost carrier, 5 stars.",1
2017-11-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no money saved in flying Spirit,False,"  Customer service check-in for Spirit Airlines at Fort Lauderdale airport was a horrible experience. We flew from the UK to the US with a different carrier, since Spirit does not do international flights and we had no issues, but we were to get a connecting flight through Spirit from Fort Lauderdale into Atlanta. Due to circumstances outside of our control (3 international flights arriving at once through customs) we were held back for hours at customs, despite being American citizens, and the ineffiency in how the airport handled that situation made us miss our connection through Spirit. This is not the check-in customer representatives fault. Planes get delayed all the time, people miss flights all the time. Things happen. We understand. However, under these bad situations we do not need personell making a bad situation worse by then exploiting their customers. The lady at check-in, finding that our flight had left already was going to charge us $99 for the privilege of connecting us onto the next flight which is remarkably absurd. Her attitude was rude and unhelpful. She had the incorrect assumption that we missed our flight due to self-imposed tardiness or mismanaging on our part, and her line of questioning gave this away - at one point she stated that if we had flown Spirit, our flight wouldn't have been delayed, not understanding that we were coming from international. In communication she rolled her eyes and at first refused to see her supervisor. We eventually did get it through a supervisor to board a next day flight, but with paying for carry on bags, for hotel fees for missing our flight, etc. There is no money saved in flying Spirit anymore. And with that kind of customer service, uncomfortable seating, and exploitative practices, will not recommend to anybody.",-1
2017-11-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,inhumane seating,False," Dallas to Fort Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines. The worst airline I have ever used. Inhumane seating. You can feeling strong back pain after a flying. You get what you pay for. I would not be surprised if the remove all seating so people can fly standing and they can earn more money. Also they charge you for a bottle of water, for a small bag, for carry on, etc, will not recommend this airline to anyone.",-1
2017-11-01,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Dallas Fort Worth,3.0,2.0,5.0,,,5.0,3.0,staff were all so lovely and helpful,False,  I flew from Boston to Dallas Fort Worth. I have flown with Spirit Airlines before and have to say I wasn't overly impressed. This time however it was a completely different experience. Every member of staff I came across was wonderful to myself and my ten week old son. I was nervous about flying with such a young baby but the staff on flight 857 were all so lovely and helpful and made me feel so much better about traveling. The plane was clean and spacious and the whole flight went without a hitch.,1
2017-10-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Latrobe,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,nickel and dime you for everything,False,"  This is the 2nd round trip I've flown with Spirit Airlines flying from Orlando, FL to Latrobe, PA. I signed up for the $9 fare club but they still nickel and dime you for everything. After several days of trying to book my flight with my fare club I gave up and called customer service and tried to explain what I was trying to do. It was obvious I was talking to someone overseas because I couldn't understand their accent and they couldn't comprehend what I was saying. After a half hour I gave up and just hung up. With having to fly out the next day I just booked the flight and paid full price. Save your money and don't sign up and pay for the fare club or fly spirit for that matter. 2 round trip flights was enough for me. I won't fly with them anymore.",-1
2017-10-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Baltimore Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,"Terrible, terrible experience",False,"  New Orleans to Baltimore Washington. Terrible, terrible experience. Delayed our flight, then cancelled our flight. Waited two hours in line to rebook a flight for tomorrow, missing work as a result of Spirits incompetence. The Wyndham hotel they put us in had no hot water, sink was clogged and backed up. Spirit did absolutely nothing for the major inconvenience they caused by cancelling a return flight home, again missing work. Paying for the hotel and new flight is a given since their plane required maintenance. Not that I would ever fly Spirit again, but flight voucher? Miles?",-1
2017-10-30,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Hartford,1.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,you get nickeled and dimed,False,"  Flew from Fort Lauderdale to Hartford. First I want to say there were no problems with the flight. We left on time, arrived early, and the staff were all very nice. This review is based more on the value for the money. We flew from CT to FL and had a great trip down with another airline at a comparable ticket price. On that flight there was wifi, small tv's for every seat, and the seats were quite comfortable. The trip back with Spirit was very different. There was no entertainment at all, the seats were one step above sitting on hard plastic, and you have basically no leg room. While these things are far from an actual issue what gets me is that you get nickeled and dimed to the point that Spirit is as expensive or in my case more expensive than flying with an airline with much better accommodations. After purchasing the tickets I then found out that luggage was twice the cost of the other airline ($45 for a carry on bag), and I also had to purchase a seat ($20 for the cheap seats). Wasn't that what the cost of the ticket was for? Again I didn't have a bad experience with Spirit but I think you'll find much more value with other airlines when you look at the all in cost.",-1
2017-10-29,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Dallas,5.0,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,customer service impeccable,False," After reading their reviews, I was a little scared to fly on Spirit, but after today, it will always be my first choice. The customer service was impeccable, the wait to sit in our seats was surprisingly quick and the flight attendants even offered entertainment near the end of the plane. The only complaint I had with the experience was when the people in the back rows were cutting the rest of us off to get off the flight, which I'm sure there is nothing Spirit can do about that. Otherwise an amazing experience with a flight for the first time in my life.",1

Spirit Airlines sent me an email saying I can carry on anything that’s the size of 18x14x8 for free, which is the size of my mini suitcase. I get there they said I need to pay $65 as it did not fit in their box which was definitely smaller. What a way to rip people off!",-1

After reading many bad reviews, I was nervous about what I had got my family and myself into. I ended up being pleased and overall, it was a great experience. First, I arrived two hours before my flight as all airlines do. Secondly, I followed all their rules as far as luggage/carry on/personal item size requirements and everything ran smoothly. Next, I made sure to check in online the day before and print out my own boarding passes. Lastly, I came prepared with bottled water and a bag of snacks. If you follow what they tell you, everything runs great. All of their staff from the beginning of our journey through to the end, were very friendly. I will be flying with them again.",1
2017-10-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Washington,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Bait and switch at its finest,False,"  Atlanta to Washington. Bait and switch at its finest. I used their services two times this month alone. Starts with their really low fares and rates, it looks super appealing because it's almost half of what other airlines would charge. Until they charge you for your bag (as much as your flight normally), seats , government cut and others you end up paying the same amount if not more as you would traveling other airlines. My complain however is the their customer service, their cancellation policy states 24 hours after reserving or 7 days prior your flight you'd entitled to a refund. My flight is Nov 3 and I called today Oct 26 to see if I could push my flight up and sure that option is available -  for more than my original flight price. After inquiring about a refund if they couldn't work with me or drop the rate to what would be reasonable they stated there is no refund policy period. Last time flying with airline. Sure you would save if you just fly with a bag that's the size of your backpack but if you have carry ons or checked bags, its worth you going with a more reputable airline with better customer service.",-1

I have checked my carry on luggage on ticketing. Your staff said it is ok. But boarding gate staff said I need to pay $65. I bought ticket from New York to San Diego. It said I can bring a carry on luggage 45*35*20. Your staff didn't check the size, just saying it is big and charge me $65. And the staff also told me I need to pay another $130 for my next 2 journey. I have to get rid of my suitcase at the gate and bring all my stuff in 2 plastic bags. I am 100% sure my luggage is standard size. How could be $195 for luggage and plus $135 for air ticket! I am not the only customer who has been charged at the gate! When scanned the ticket, they can see you are new to the flight, forced me to pay with horrible attitude.  I believe I am not the first and not the last customer having this problem with Spirit. We need to speak out and let all other customers know how horrible Spirit airline is, how greedy the airline is. =",-1

The flight landed at 1:25 pm and at the baggage claim, first bag arrived at 2:25 pm. On asking the Spirit baggage service staff, we were told you just have to wait. For a domestic flight, I fail to understand why there would be that kind of delay.",-1
2017-10-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,FLL to SJO,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,told me the flight was oversold,False,"  Spirit Airlines is the absolute worst airline. I arrived at the airport on time and went to the counter. The agent told me the flight was oversold so they wanted to book me on a flight the next day as standby. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She told me I was not allowed on the flight because it was oversold and there was nothing they can do about it. I had a medical procedure to be done and could not go. I called the next day to get a full refund and was informed that due to their policies, I could not get a refund. I lost $750.00. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again. this is not the first issue I have had with them  but I finally learned my lesson because my health is at stake. Spirit Airlines run their operation with the worst customer service from out of the US and really do not have customer service. They do not care! It's about taking your money with no regard for the customer. I do not recommend Spirit Airlines to anyone, regardless of some of the low cost fares.",-1

There's one stop in Fort Lauderdale, but the arrival time is the exact time as boarding to the connecting flight. Seems doable on paper, but they don't tell you have to get your luggage and recheck your bag again. We obviously missed our flight along with 20 other passengers with similar flights. Maybe you think that this was just a one time hiccup but friend of mine booked the exact same flights the week before and missed his flight. The redirected flight went through Orlando, same as mine. They obviously do this often, and I've come to the conclusion that they do this knowing very well that you will miss your flight! They offered me nothing.",-1

I made the mistake of reading the reviews after I booked my flight. I was so hesitant and even tried to cancel my flight after reading all the negative reviews. I was very surprised by this airline. I don't have one bad thing to say about them. Flight was on time. Flight attendants were amazing! They were on top of everything. We had a medical emergency and had to make an emergency landing in New Mexico. The flight attendants stayed calm and made everyone feel comfortable. Seats were not as bad as everyone made them seem. Overall my flight was great. I ended up with a 50$ credit with an apology letter due to the emergency stop. I would fly this airline again. The only negative thing I would have to say is no wifi on the plane.,1
2017-10-24,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,False,  Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale. I understand the concept of a “bare fare” but when I had the experience of having a $65 charge to put my backpack on board the plane below my feet I decided to write this review. I have a laptop bag and a backpack that both fit in their baggage check holder and she explained I can only have “1” item. I will never fly Spirit again because the fact they try to charge $65 for me to carry an extra bag on board the plane and carry it off is absurd. Do yourselves a favor and book Southwest or American or just walk to your destination.,-1
2017-10-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,should be avoided at all costs,False,"  Las Vegas to Minneapolis. Spirit Airlines should be avoided at all costs! By the time you pay all their extra fees it is more expensive than a more reputable airline. The leg room in the planes is non existent. Luckily they do not allow the seats to recline, because if they did there would be lots of passengers with broken knee caps. Their service is poor. We had booked a noon flight out of Las Vegas that connected in Dallas and arrived in Minnesota at 4:30pm. Spirit changed the schedule without notifying me to a 8 am flight out of Las Vegas connecting in Chicago with a 5 hour layover. We get in at 8:30pm. 12 hours worth of airports and flying!. When i called to get it changed to a more reasonable flight i was told it could not be changed unless i wanted to travel on a later date. While waiting for 5 hours in Chicago, we heard announcements for a Spirit flight that was canceled due to not being able to find flight attendants. Another flight had it's gate changed at the last minute catching several passengers off guard and having to sprint to the new gate. This is an airline that should go away. Do not use Spirit!!",-1
2017-10-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to New Orleans,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,experience is not worth the price,False,"  Houston to New Orleans. I have flown Spirit Airlines a total of 3 time now (all round trips). All three of the times that I flew with Spirit, I have always encountered delay, set back, or flight cancelation. This will be my last time to fly with this airline. The experience is not worth the price.",-1
2017-10-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,New Orleans to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly Spirit again,False,  New Orleans to Fort Lauderdale. I was traveling with a group to a PMA convention. We got to the airport at the same time. The rest of my group was traveling with Southwestern. They were in the plane at the original flight time and called me to let me know. Spirit had just informed us that we were going to have an hour delay. I thought well only an hour. Ok I’ll make arrangements. However as the night progressed we were informed again that there was a longer delay. At this point I realized that we were being lied to and I didn’t appreciate hat at all. The lack of consideration to those of us waiting was obvious. There was no inclement weather in our area nor in the Houston area where the plane was coming from. I will never fly Spirit again nor would I recommend it to anyone. Very poor professionalism when a company does not value the time and inconveniences that you place on your customers.,-1
2017-10-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,entire reservation was cancelled,False,"  New Orleans to Dallas. Horrible experience. My sister missed her flight due to lack of parking at the Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans. We quickly booked her another flight through American Airlines that was scheduled to depart later the same day since Spirit didn't have anymore. As we were checking in for her departure flight back to New Orleans, the representative informed me that the entire reservation was cancelled due to not showing up to the first flight. I asked what would happen to the original ticket I purchased and she informed me that it was available for repurchase for a higher cost. Ridiculous. She then informed me that the proper procedure would have been to inform an airport representative of the missed flight immediately so Spirit could reschedule the flight for the next day. I told her not only was my sister's arrival time sensitive, but speaking to a Spirit airport agent at the front desk would have caused her to miss her flight with American Airlines. She duly apologized and in essence said rules were rules. Ridiculous. I asked to speak to a manager (located overseas), after being transferred a million times and speaking to the supervisor, and the call was mysteriously disconnected. Terrible service.",-1
2017-10-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Los Angeles via Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,most expensive airline,False,  Houston to Los Angeles via Atlanta. Don't ever fly with Spirit they come out to be the most expensive airline with all the fees they charge. They charge for almost everything. I booked with them thinking it would be cheaper but I ended up paying almost triple the amount. There customer service sucks and the seats are so uncomfortable. They don't even offer complimentary snacks or entertainment.,-1
2017-10-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Baltimore,,,,,,1.0,4.0,She said that we can't help,False,"  Detroit to Baltimore. The flight was supposed to leave at 8:45 am and I was at the airport with mobile checkin at 7:45 am. In domestic flights, you can easily pass the security in 20-25 mins and board the flight. But this time it took me about 50 mins to clear the security.  I informed the gate attendant that its taking longer than usual and people have been stuck. She said that we can't help. Then who can help? She closed the gate right on time without waiting for a single minute. And the flight left at 8:40 am instead of 8:45 am.",-1
2017-10-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,4.0,ruined a long awaited weekend,False,  Spirit cancelled their only flight from Kansas City to Las Vegas on October 21 four hours before departure. Their only options for us were to fly out the next morning on October 22nd or another day in the future. Flying out another day doesn’t matter when your plans were specifically for the weekend. Spirit ruined a long awaited and anticipated weekend in Vegas all for crew unpreparedness. Thanks. Oh and thanks for the $50 voucher that expires in the next month that I won’t be using.,-1
2017-10-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Montego Bay via Ft Lauderdale,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,absolute worst airline around,False,"  Dallas to Montego Bay via Ft Lauderdale. I never complain about anything, but I must warn travelers about Spirit Airlines.  I became sick and took a few trips to the restroom. At one point, I could hear two of the flight attendants talking to each other and laughing at me for going to the restroom multiple times. If I could hear it while in the bathroom, I'm sure that other people could hear which was really embarrassing for me. The flight from Jamaica had one delay after another. In all the flight was delayed by 4 hours, which resulted in most of the passengers, including myself, missing our connecting flights back home. Spirit set up accommodations for us at very low quality motels (the window in room did not completely close and my shower didn't work, but that's beside the point), and we were given food vouchers that the motel did not honor. The shuttle didn't start running until 6am, but my flight back home required me to get to leave the motel at 5am, so I had to spend $30 on a taxi. Since I couldn't use my food vouchers, I had to spend my own money for food at the airport, $11. Since I arrived home a day late due to Spirit's delays, the person who was supposed to pick me up from the airport was no longer able to so I had to spend another $30 to pay for a ride home. I also missed a half day of work, so I missed a half day of wages. Spirit Airlines is the absolute worst airline around. I would not recommend for anyone to travel with Spirit.",-1
2017-10-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,just want to take advantage,False,"  Absolutely avoid Spirit at all costs. They scam customers by advertising inexpensive flights, then requiring additional fees for a seat, not for changing or upgrading a seat, just to sit on the plane. With a seat, one checked bag, and no carry-on, I paid over $100 more for the flight from Orlando to Newark. Upon arriving to the airline baggage drop area, there were hundreds of people stretching out into other sections of the airport, and three people managing checked bags. After disembarking, I waited over an hour for my checked bag. They don't care and just want to take advantage of you and squeeze you for money wherever they can.",-1
2017-10-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Diego to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Don't book this airline,False,"  I flew Spirit Airlines from San Diego to Las Vegas. If you do fly this dreadful airline, be sure to check in online the night before because it will cost an extra $10 per person if you do it at the airport. Also, don't even pack a carry-on larger than a backpack. For small rolling bags, they charge $45 if you check in online, and $55 at the airport. Yes. For a carry on. Also, when you buy a ticket, the seat isn't included in the price. Be prepared to drop another $5-$10 on your seat. If you thought that you'd at least get a complimentary water or juice on the plane, you would be incorrect. $3 for an orange juice. Flight staff was rude and made me uncomfortable. After the safety presentation, the flight attendant said, ""to all who paid attention - thank you! to those who did not - good luck"".  Don't book this airline. If I could have given 0 stars, I would have.",-1
2017-10-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Avoid Spirit at all costs,False,"  Flew Spirit from Houston to Denver. The absolute worst traveling experience I have ever had. First they may as well take an arm, leg, and your first born child if you have any bags. Secondly, on the flight out here their plane may as well been held together with duct tape and bubble gum. Thirdly, now I'm stuck in Houston because, despite getting to the airport well over an hour before my flight was set to depart, Spirit denied me at the check in because I was ""too late to check in"". Save yourself the time and hassle. Avoid Spirit at all costs.",-1
2017-10-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlantic City to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,told the flight was closed,False,"  Atlantic City to Ft Lauderdale. We arrived at the airport early to find a line filling the entire check in area. When we finally were in sight of the agents (about 40 min. later) we were pulled out of line with a few others and were told the flight was “closed” and we would have to rebook. We were put in another line and after an additional wait were told we could be put on the next flight 5 hours later for a rebooking fee of $100 per ticket. When we politely complained we were told they go through the line to calling the flight.  In our conversation with the agent we were told this happens every day, in other words they plan on this to increase revenue. Next trip I will drive a little farther and fly a real airline and never deal with Spirit’s bait and switch schemes again.",-1

2017-10-13,0.1,Business,Business Class,New Orleans to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,experience was terrible,False,"  New Orleans to Atlanta. This is the second time I have flown with Spirit. I had a horrible experience the first time so I should have learned my lesson. every part of the experience was terrible. Their website crashed while I was trying to check in. So I had to call them. They hide their customer service phone number. I finally found it. Then, they were going to charge me a premium for making arrangements by phone. I hung up and tried online again. It worked that time. I had to pay for my seat and $40 for 1 bag. The overall cost was now more than Southwest, which I should have booked in the first place. I got to the airport to check my bag and the representative was very rude. She wouldn't pull up my information with my driver's license and demanded I show her the boarding pass on my email instead. Very rude about it. I paid a little extra for a business class seat. It wasn't very comfortable and it wouldn't recline. During the flight, the lady behind me kept kicking my seat. I gave her a look to stop but she kept doing it. I then asked for a cup of coffee and they said it was $2.00. Nothing is complimentary with Spirit. If you pay their fare, reserve a seat, and pay for baggage, they are no cheaper than other airlines. If you like terrible service, random seating, and don't take any baggage, Spirit is the airline for you.",-1
2017-10-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The staff are very rude,False,"  Flew Fort Lauderdale to Newark. I am a frequent flyer and this is my first bad review about anything, this was by far the worst airline I've ever encountered. Spirit Airlines does not offer a glass of water, the seats are very uncomfortable, do not recline, dont have charging ports, no TV. I thought I was getting a good deal booking this flight but just to check my bags was $100 round trip at the airport. The staff are very rude. Thank goodness I was not flying for more than 2hrs, so disappointed in myself for this one.",-1
2017-10-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines customer review,False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Oakland to Baltimore. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices. They nickel and dime you to death, so that by the time you've checked (or even carried on) your bags and selected your seats, you're paying just as much as, if not more than as you would for a legitimate airline. They usually take off late, and once you board, you get the privilege of sitting on the comfort-equivalent of a park bench! The seats don't recline, and there's no inflight entertainment whatsoever, even for cross country flights! Oh, and whatever you do, don't be one second later than 45 minutes before the flight is scheduled to depart, or they'll make you reschedule your flight for an additional $99/person, even if there's plenty of time to get to the gate and board the plane. And one more thing, the customer service is rude and completely unsympathetic and unhelpful.",-1
2017-10-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Atlanta,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,terrible customer service,False," Tampa to Atlanta. This was a Terrible experience from start to finish. My flight was delayed 4hrs due to not having a pilot to bring our plane to Tampa.  They ended up canceling the flight at 1130pm. Since they cancelled the flight so late we ended up not being able to book another flight for that night and subsequently I missed an very important meeting. After arguing and pleading my case I was advised that I would be credited a voucher. Now that I need to use the voucher I am told that it expired and I am out of luck. This is an example of terrible customer service and I will never fly Spirit again. Sad to say I would rather fly Allegiant then deal with this companie's false promises, terrible customer service, and overall lack of professionalism!",-1
2017-10-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Dallas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst flying experience I've had,False,"  Philadelphia to Dallas. This was by far the worst flying experience I've ever had and I have flown American Airlines! There were 3 delays to my flight yesterday with multiple gate changes. Of course, no one was at the counter until later in the evening so it was hard to know what was going on. My flight was supposed to be at 1.00pm but was delayed until 7.05pm! Then on my flight to Philadelphia our aircraft had issues with the air conditioner! We were all sweating and then forced to buy your on board drinks. The $100 dollars I ""saved"" by flying with Spirit was certainly not worth the aggravation. Of course, the final insult to all of this is your $50 voucher, $50 dollars, really? You think $50 dollars will entice me to pay for another flight?",-1

This is by far the worst airline I have ever dealt with. My confirmed flight to Dallas was to leave at 1:00pm - well it is now 6:45pm and hopefully, we are suppose to leave at 7:05. We have had to change gates 3x, had 3 delays, and they gave me a whole 50.00 credit to fly with them again. Seriously? I'd rather walk! If you want to get where you need to be and not have your blood pressure go thru the roof avoid Spirit at all costs.",-1
2017-10-09,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Denver,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Spirit again,False,  Dallas to Denver. My husband and I had one bag. We had flown United with the same bag same weight three days before for $25.00. It was $50 with Spirit. We get to the bag drop and are informed that it is overweight. There limit is 40#. Our bag was 50#. So another $30 is added. $80 total. I will never fly Spirit again.,-1

Should that mean you have a spot on the plane?? Most would say yes but Spirit Airlines wouldn't. Not only do you pay astronomical prices in bags you don't even get a seat on the plane for which you bought the tickets. Spend more more to fly with a different airline. It's worth it. Thanks Spirit Airlines for ruining my week.,-1
2017-10-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Dallas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never use this airline again,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Dallas. I will never be traveling with Spirit Airlines again. I specifically bought my luggage and had it measured to meet the new specifications. I even flew into Dallas from Ft Lauderdale with no extra charge or problem. However, upon my return from Dallas to Ft Lauderdale an attendant proceeded to stop my daughter & me and charged us $130 for both our luggages because they did not meet specifications. This is unacceptable as the measurements were in compliance and attendant was adamant that the wheels disqualified my luggage. I do not understand the inconsistency in Spirit airlines attendants and why we were not charged on our first leg of our trip. Therefore, despite their economical offers, this unprofessional behavior will cause me to never use this airline again.",-1
2017-10-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no bus no update whatsoever,False,"  Do not buy into their cheap fare, because cheap equates to their customer service as well. My flight from Chicago to Las Vegas was diverted to Phoenix due to a shooting that shut down Las Vegas airport. We sat in the tarmac for 3 hours then decided to deplane us. Later on, we were told a bus was taking us to Vegas. That was 4am, we were given a $7 voucher for food, then the bus will be waiting for us. It's 7am now, and I'm still here, no bus no update whatsoever.",-1
2017-09-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,need to hire a better PR team,False," I booked a flight on Spirit Airlines in July 2017. I was able to cancel the flight and receive a voucher, which was required to be used within 60 days of cancelation. I attempted to use the voucher within the 60 day period, but I was unable to secure a flight as I was in the path of Hurricane Irma and all flights were canceled until further notice. I called Spirit Airlines to try and use the voucher once the Hurricane passed and unfortunately I was outside the 60 day period. The representative at Spirit Airlines informed me that I was outside the expiration date of the voucher and that there was no way to assist me at that time. I had hoped that since other companies, like my credit card company American Express, or car companies, like General Motors, were offering an exception due to the natural disaster, perhaps Spirit , headquartered in Fort Lauderdale where I live and where the hurricane directly hit, might have a heart. They don't. Instead they offered me a travel coupon which required I travel on flexible dates. What would be the purpose of buying a plane ticket without with having uncertainty as to the dates I'm traveling. Spirit Airlines, you need to hire a better PR team and understand that during extraordinary times, it is ok, and sometimes in your best interest as a company, to deviate from your business model to show the community you call home that you have a corporate conscience.",-1
2017-09-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst customer service,False,"  Spirit has to have the worst customer service! I booked a flight out of Newark to Ft Lauderdale and it was cancelled due to ""bad"" weather, even though every other airline flying to FLL wasn't canceled. The flight was 6:00 am but they canceled it 7:00 pm the night before? How can they say it was because of bad weather? Spirit booked me on the 3:25 pm flight the same day and that was also canceled due to ""bad"" weather. At this point I was already in Ft Lauderdale, we took a 6:30 am Southwest flight from Newark to Ft Lauderdale. So obviously bad weather wasn't the problem since Southwest flight went on time. OK I get it the Spirit flight didn't have enough seats sold so they canceled. I called them to get my refund, after 45 minutes on hold I got through and they said they would credit the entire $374. Just received my AMEX statement they gave me a $314 credit. I will never fly Spirit!",-1
2017-09-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,just come back tomorrow!,False,"  Myrtle Beach to Philadelphia. I recently booked a ticket for myself, my two adult sons and my grandson for a trip back home for a family event. We selected Spirit because of the reasonable cost even though the departure airport was 1½ hours from Charleston, SC. The airport location was Myrtle Beach, SC and we drove up there on Thursday, September 14th to spend the night so we would not miss the early morning flight out on Friday, September 15th to Philadelphia, PA. We arrived at the airport bright and early and waited in line to check our bags. After waiting for 30 minutes, one of your staff started yelling for all of those customers who booked the Myrtle Beach to Philadelphia flight, to move to another line because the flight had been cancelled. We were shocked to hear this. I had been notified by email at 4:45 am that morning but failed to read the email. When we got to the desk, my question was “what are our options?” The staff told me to come back the next day which was Saturday. I told her that wouldn’t work because my son would lose the cost of the hotel reservation because he was cancelling without 24 hour notice and we would incur an additional night’s cost for hotel accommodations in Myrtle Beach. We were also attending a family event that evening that was critical to our attendance. There were no other options provided by the Spirit staff member. Her explanation for the cancellation was it was due to the hurricane. I would expect that one, two, three or ever four days after that event, but almost a week was hard to swallow. Apparently, the hurricane did not impact the other two airlines adjacent to Spirit because they were ready and able to assist. Ultimately, I booked with Delta Airlines. Needless to say, this cost me a lot more money for my outgoing flight than what I paid for my Spirit flight and had to fly to Philadelphia via Detroit. Regardless of the harrowing day, we did arrive in time for our family event, with no credit going to any one at Spirit. While waiting for our flight, we checked other options Spirit may have provided had they had any semblance of trying to satisfy their customers. There was a flight to Atlantic City - could have rented a car there and driven to Delaware. A mere 1 hour from our destination. There was a flight to Baltimore - could have rented a car there and driven to Delaware. A mere 1½ hours from our destination. Could have flown into LaGuardia and probably hopped on a short commuter to Philadelphia, but none of these options were provided by the Spirit staff, just come back tomorrow! Because our car was parked at Myrtle Beach airport, we had to arrange for our return flight back to Myrtle Beach and unfortunately, Spirit was our only option. When booking the return flight, I contacted Spirit and asked the representative to waive our checked bag fee due to the additional expenses and inconvenience we encountered and I was told in no uncertain words, No! Didn’t make me happy. Didn't show me Spirit care about their customers. Didn’t make me want to ever book with Spirit again.",-1
2017-09-28,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,was satisfied with both flights,False,"  I was nervous to fly with Spirit Airlines after reading all the bad reviews. I had a round-trip from Newark - Fort Lauderdale - Newark and was satisfied with both flights, especially the first one. We left early, arrived 30 min early and it was the smoothest flight I have had. Very quiet flight, no flight attendants going back and forth and blocking the way to the bathroom. When you want to purchase something, prices are very reasonable. Seats are ok, not crazy small as it was described in many reviews. People complain a lot just because they dont read the rules catefully, such as that it is a low cost airline and you have to pay for carry on. But if you travel as a couple it is still worth it, you pack one nice big luggage, pay for it 30$, but now you can bring your shampoo, perfume or whatever ""liquid"" you want on your vacation. If you travel light you definitely win in ticket price. But sometimes even with paying for luggage, it is still cheaper to fly. The day before the flight I saw tickets cost only $55 one way. Where else do you see price as low as this? Spirit's planes are all new. Conclusion: if you fly short distance, want to save money, take Spirit if the price difference between other airlines significantly lower (just dont forget to add $30 for baggage to ticket price when compare). There is nothing bad about Spirit Airlines except no allowance of carry on.",1
2017-09-28,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Plattsburgh to Ft Lauderdale.,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,"So helpful, so considerate ",False,"  On September 5th I was booked on a returning flight 451 at 2:40am from Plattsburgh to Ft Lauderdale. I was visiting my mom and dad for Labor Day weekend in Drummondville Quebec and by September 4th I realized that my dad needed to come back home with me. He was very ill. I decided to book a ticket for him to fly back with me. We managed to get my dad in a wheelchair at Plattsburgh airport and at the check in counter the agent change his seat from row 11 to the front of the plane without any questions. No extra charge, second row aisle. Normally $70 charge! Once on the plane the flight attendant motioned that my son and I also sit upfront and let me sit just behind my dad. Row 3. There were 2 flight attendants on this flight that I could remember. So helpful, so considerate and I just wanted to say Thank You!  Thirty minutes before landing my dad needed to use the restroom so I helped him to the front lavatory and it turns out that it wasn't his first time during the flight. The flight attendant helped him get to the bathroom without my knowledge cause I had fallen asleep. Normally he could of done it by himself with his walker but we had to gate check it. To the guy in the first row for offering your arm as a railing to help my dad get back to his seat, your kind gesture was a priceless image in my mind! I will never forget. I now find the time to write this email because my dad passed away September 22, 2017.",1

I was supposed to take a vacation during in early September. Then hurricane Irma was supposed to hit right when I was going to fly in.  When I found out the Orlando airport was getting shut down, I called both companies to move my flights up another week thinking If the hurricane did not hit my destination that it would be back up and running by then. Frontier Airlines gave me no problems, but Spirit was ready to charge me their everyday fee to change my flight. I spoke to a supervisor with Spirit and they allowed me to change it for 1 week later. The following week, my resort was still going to be shut down until almost half way through my stay. I sent an email requesting a refund or credit with frontier and they refunded me with no problem. It looked as though I would need to call Spirit and did so explaining that I would not be in Orlando to take part in their flight from Orlando to Chicago because of the after effects of hurricane Irma. They said they could not do anything for me. The gentleman I sopke with informed me they would need to charge me a cancellation fee and that would cost the whole amount of the 2 one way tickets I had purchased. The gentleman I spoke with obviously had no intentions of actually helping me in any way.",-1

2017-09-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Hartford,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,seats are ridiculously small,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Hartford. Each bag costs between 35-50, both carry-on and checked each way, domestic or international. My flight from Newark to Bogota was cancelled a few hours before it was supposed to take off. Not even a day's or 12 hours notice. I stayed on the phone with customer service for nearly 3 hours to find another flight. They put me on another airline. On the way back aboard Spirit I found out that you must pay for everything. We were delayed getting off the plane because of customs. I did not make my connecting flight, which was scheduled an hour and a half after my first flight. Many others were in the same situation as me with connecting flights to other destinations. I don't know why Spirit would schedule flights close together, why they wouldn't hold flights filled with passengers from their other planes, and why they wouldn't make an effort to ensure their passengers reach their destinations on time. I spent $120 on a hotel room. I should've used that to travel on another airline that isn't as frustrating. While waiting for my new flight, they changed the gate ten minutes prior to boarding. The airplane wasn't at the new gate. At the scheduled time of departure, they made an announcement that the plane would be delayed. Delays are fine, but the fact that it took the airline so long to notify their passengers of the changes is not fine. The seats are ridiculously small with no screens or option to recline. The on board crew was nice and paid careful attention to the safety of the passengers. That was the only good thing about Spirit.",-1
2017-09-19,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Pittsburgh,3.0,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,staff were very entertaining,False,  Flew Orlando to Pittsburgh. I have never done a review before but thought I had to. The staff were very entertaining and polite. The gentleman over the loud speaker had a very entertaining personality while being professional. I thought they also took it an extra step further by showing everyone how to put on a life vest and how to inflate it. Not all airlines or flights that I have been on have done this. I will definitely be flying with Spirit Airlines. again!,1
2017-09-18,1.0,Couple Leisure,First Class,Pittsburgh to Orlando,4.0,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,Nothing about this trip was bad,False,"  Flew Pittsburgh to Orlando. I've been terrified to fly with Spirit Airlines for 6 months now. However, Spirit was nothing like the reviews. The flight was on time and we arrived early to Orlando. The staff were all nice and tried to make the flight fun. Nothing about this trip was bad. Just remember there are so many more people that fly than these reviews but the only ones to leave them are the negative ones. Imagine how many people have had no problems at all but don't think to comment.",1
2017-09-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is unreliable,False,"  Newark to Ft Lauderdale. Spirit is unreliable and not necessarily the least expensive option. There are plenty of hidden costs. Since there is a high risk in losing a flight, this translates to hours of wasted time talking with customer service, which is really a useless outsourced buffer.  Our flight was cancelled after 5 hr delay in April. We had expenses such as hotel, airport travel, car rental, so Spirit gave us a refund of the flights, along with 2 x $50 vouchers per person (We can't combine the vouchers on a single booking). Although this didn't cover all the expenses, I decided to let it pass. There were a few issues. Vouchers had to be used within 2 months to book two other trips per person (4 tickets in total). I couldn't find any destination for which Spirit was a better option than other airlines. And I was determined to fly to many destinations in order to use the vouchers. I inadvertently allowed vouchers to expire. I've been on hold with their customer service for 1.5 hours, to try and get them extended. They have me bouncing around like a ping pong ball. Everyone says I could've extend them if I called before expiration, which is a ridiculous rule.",-1
2017-09-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Worst flying experience ever,False,"  Las Vegas to Detroit cancelled 10 minutes before boarding because the plane wasn't even there. If they were that delayed we should have had a lot more notice. Second flight Las Vegas to Cleveland cancelled because a flight attendant was late for her shift. Now I'm stuck in the airport from 5am till 7:45pm in hopes of getting a flight with 3 layovers, overnight through a different company and I've received $24 food credit for my trouble? Absolutely ridiculous. Third flight through American airlines was great minus the fact that Spirit didn't put our checked bag ($45) on the ticket or our $20 reserved seats. Worst flying experience ever. I would never recommend Spirit to anyone. If I could pick 0/10 for all questions I absolutely would.",-1
2017-09-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never ever again,False," Worst experience ever! Flight from Detroit to Las Vegas on September 11 was cancelled and rebooked for 12 hours later, then the departing flight from Vegas to Detroit was cancelled. They rebooked us on a flight for the next day. Customer service was horrible. Staff were rude, we were made to stand in a long line just to talk to a ticket agent who didn't seem interested in helping us at all. The only thing they gave us for our trouble was a $7.00 food voucher for having to wait at the airport for 19 hours for our first flight out of Vegas to Minneapolis and then for a 5 hour layover there. We will be getting home 24 hours later than we were supposed to. I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. Never ever again!",-1
2017-09-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,won't take the responsibility,False,"  My flight from Minneapolis to Dallas has been canceled and they finally booked us a flight for next day. Their rude staff made us stand in front of check in gate for 4 hours to book a hotel room for non-local passengers, seriously 4 hours. We asked them to call a manager a million times and at the end at 10 pm someone (a supervisor) came and told us there is not any hotel available in the area. It is 4am and we got stuck in this freezing airport. We could not even eat something last night because all security gates were closed at 10 pm.  This airline won't take the responsibility of their cancellations and rude staff will not even respect you as customer.",-1
2017-09-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,always delay their flights,False,"  Seattle to Los Angeles. I'm writing this review as I wait for my Spirit flight. Second time (3rd leg) flying with this airline, by mistake! We made the mistake of quickly purchasing the cheapest tickets without identifying the airline prior to purchase - you know how easy it is to purchase via your phone with just one or two clicks. These guys always delay their flights. The original flight time for the flight that we are currently waiting for was 9:30am, then 12:15pm, then 11:50am, and now the flight time has once again changed until after 1:00pm. Terrible experience with these guys and always have a lame excuse for their tardiness. If you are a business traveler with scheduled meetings to attend, or if you are traveling due to a family emergency, do not use this airline because you will definitely miss your meetings and/or your emergency. Alaska Airlines all the way - they are a little more expensive but worth every dollar!",-1
2017-09-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,hard to reach for customer service,False," I went to Chicago from New York on 9/7/2017 by Spirit. It seems the ticket price is cheap ($90.40 for round trip), but actually, it is more expensive because of a lot of hidden charges. The carry-on baggage is free for the most airlines except this airline, which charges $67 for one trip. If you select the seat by your self, it may be charged $14 to $50. On the plane, all drinks including water, it is chargeable, etc. It is very hard to reach the phone for customer service.",-1
2017-09-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Detroit,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,stranded in Las Vegas,False,  Las Vegas to Detroit. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! My wife and I got stranded in Las Vegas when Spirit suddenly cancelled all of their flights. They gave us two options: rebook for a flight two days later or take a refund. There was no help with any other options. Beware if you even consider Spirit Airlines.,-1
2017-09-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,lack of professionalism,False," They are cheap, at first, but it will cost you. You have to pay for bags. (If you fly Southwest you don't have to pay for bags). Our flight got canceled. Like many others did. We were stuck at the airport for 12 hours. Their lack of professionalism, customer service and empathy made the experience worse. They're policy is that they do not accommodate - ever. Intel from the airport says they are always having problems. Say they constantly cancel flights and that they come up with different excuses as to why. This time was the storm which had already passed and had not affected many of the destinations people were flying in or out of.",-1
2017-09-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,last time I will ever use Spirit,False,"  I called Spirit airlines Monday, September 11, 17 after a cancelled flight. The agent told me the next flight from Santo Domingo to Ft Lauderdale is in Saturday. I specifically asked ""Spirit will not have a flight out of the Dominican to Ft Lauderdale until Saturday?"". He said no. I called again today. I spoke to another agent. She tells me there is a flight tomorrow and  another Friday from Santo Domingo to Ft Lauderdale. Per the second agent, Spirit will not correct the first agent's lie without payment from me. This Saturday will be the last time I will ever use Spirit Airlines.",-1

The flight was delayed by three hours because the flight attendants never showed up. This is a direct quote I received - ""We do not know where the flight attendants are and we do not know when they will get here."" While I was waiting for my flight in those three hours I saw every single Spirit Airlines flight either get cancelled or delayed by over 2+ hours. It's a terrible airline. Pay the extra money for southwest, delta, etc and save yourself the headache. Seriously.",-1
2017-09-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to San Diego,,,,,,,1.0, I am very disappointed,False,"  I was to fly from Baltimore to San Diego on Sunday 9/10/17 at 7am. I stayed with a friend the night before, so I could get dropped off at the airport. I was informed during check-in that the flight was cancelled. I was starting a new job the next day so it was imperative that I left the day of my booking and not on a flight rescheduled for the next day. I eventually booked on South West Airlines at more 6.5 times the cost (almost $400 more) of what I had booked my flight with Spirit. I was forced to pay this exorbitant price so that I could reach my destination on time. I am very disappointed at being left stranded.",-1
2017-09-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3.0,Horrible customer service ,False,"  Orlando to Boston. They cancelled my flight out of Orlando on Sept 8th, before hurricane Irma - while other other major airlines were still departing. They offered me a refund of the second half of my ticket, since they couldn't get me out before the hurricane. It in no way covered the amount I had to pay to get out on a different airline, or the 12 hour car ride to Atlanta, or the stress of dealing with the whole situation. They didn't offer any other kind of credit. So sad, Southwest gave me 150 credit when they cancelled a flight. Horrible customer service is not worth a cheap flight.",-1
2017-09-12,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las vegas to Pittsburgh,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,I will fly with them again,False,"  Las Vegas to Pittsburgh. I thought everything was straight forward. I purchased a round trip ticket for me and my family. A total of 4 tickets. They point out on the site personal items are free within certain parameters. Carry on and check bags you have to purchase. I purchased 2 check in bags. Most airlines charge for check in bags for domestic flights. No complaints so far. As for seating assignments, I called customer service to see if we would be split up? I was told as long as all the tickets were purchased under the same reservation we would be sitting together.  On the website you also have the option to purchase an upgraded seat such as an exit row seat. The day before your flight you receive an email telling you to check in and print your boarding pass. I checked in online and printed my boarding pass for my flight the next day. On the printed boarding pass I notice we have our seat numbers. We are all sitting together. The night before I re measured my suitcase according to the dimensions on the website. I was worried something drastic would happen once I would arrive st the airport. Next day arrived at the airport, went straight to the counter checked my bags, showed them my boarding pass. Went straight to the gate. Boarded with no issues. We found our seats. We noticed the chairs do not go back. But I expected that from reading reviews and calling customer service. Legroom was average. I have flown united, American airlines, continental and us airways. The legroom was no smaller than those airlines. The negative is that the seats don't lean back and there is no courtesy water, juice or snack. My flight was from Las Vegas to Pittsburgh. The flight left on time and got there 15 minutes early. That's a plus in my book. Also what other airlines can you fly from the west coast to the east coast for $20 each way. We bought these tickets on a promotion. Overall, Not as bad as many are making it out to be. I will fly with them again. I give them an 8/10. -2 for the seats not reclining and no courtesy water and snacks.",1
2017-09-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,will never fly again with Spirit,False," I bought all my tickets 2-3 months in advance. From Boston I was flying to Europe using Lufthansa. For round ticket from Detroit to Boston with Spirit I paid ~ $180. There were no problems from Detroit to Boston but when I arrived from Europe, arround 9pm I found that Spirit cancelled flight to Detroit, that there will not be Spirit flights to Detroit, due to Irma for at least next 24 hours and maybe longer. Spirit was only offering partial refund of around $70, so not even half of the ticket. I was asking them to find me another flight but they refused to do that. I had to go around airport with my luggage to find a flight in the morning. Luckily I found another flight for the next morning for $250 but I had to be without sleep for the second night and lose half of my work day next day. Total losses are around $500. Therefore I will never fly again with Spirit.",-1
2017-09-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas/Ft Worth to Atlanta,,,,,,1.0,1.0,failure to communicate,False,"  Dallas/Ft Worth to Atlanta. I checked my bag, went thru security & headed to my gate. When I arrived at the gate I found a rather long line of very angry passengers. That was Saturday at 2pm and the flight was due to depart at 3:55. I started to call my husband & saw the flight cancellation email Spirit has sent just 5 minutes before. That means they notified me of the cancellation just 2 hours before departure. When I was finally able to speak with an airline representative they said they could possibly fly me out the next Tuesday which meant I was stuck there for 3 days or possibly even more. They offered no hotel accommodations which meant all expenses were on me! Only refunds or travel credits for future travel. They claimed the cancellation was due to weather but there was not even a cloud in the sky between Atlanta and Dallas. I asked for a refund ∧ purchased a $327 one way ticket on American Airlines leaving just 10 minutes after my original flight (see flight photo). I waited almost an hour just to retrieve my checked bag and was forced back thru security a second time. I nearly missed My American flight due to their failure to communicate the cancellation to the proper Spirit employees that needed to return the bags to the baggage area. In the end, the savings that I was supposed to have flying Spirit actually cost me more than booking with another airlines for the entire round trip flight.",-1

Receive 3 different emails about flight being delayed. First time was about 10 minutes, we're thinking on not bad. Second time was about an hour and third was by 2 hours. We arrived at the airport and waited 4 hours for the flight. Kept getting delayed and finally we got an update we will board at 8pm. And then,it got cancelled around 7:50pm. Got rebooked on the next flight out at 8am for a 9 hour flight from Vegas to Minneapolis. They wouldn't even find a place for us to sleep or try to accommodate us for the inconvenience. On top of that, one of the employees commented that ""this is Vegas, this will happen"". Decided to cancel and fly back home with another airline. What I don't understand is, it got cancelled due to weather but other airlines were still flying. Never flying Spirit again, I'd rather pay extra to get home on time that to waste a whole day getting delayed and cancelled.",-1
2017-09-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly Spirit again,False,  Flight was cancelled due to weather from Newark to Houston way before Hurricane Irma made landfall. The route does not even get close to the FL keys. Now it going to get worse and our cancelled flight will get cancelled again because it will get worse. im sure of it. Spirit is the only flight cancelled from Newark to Houston due to weather. I will never fly Spirit again.,-1
2017-09-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Baltimore,,,,,,1.0,1.0,how not to run an airline,False,  They cancelled my flight from Orlando to Baltimore and did not make an attempt to accommodate me on a later flight on the same day even though I gave the customer service rep different options. I ended up buying a new ticket with my own money. They offered a e-voucher for future travel and not even a full refund. Who wants to travel with them again after that experience? The customer service is very robotic and they do not try to understand or care to make arrangements on alternate flights. Haven't come across such horrible customer service in all these years of flying with different airlines. Spirit Airlines is the best example of how not to run an airline.,-1

I'm 47 years old. I fly about 4 times a year for the past 15 years. I've never experienced the type of delay I've had on this airline. The continuous flight delay is only one of the issues. There are other planes leaving and landing to the same destination from the same place. I don't know why we are the only plane not leaving. Unbelievable. 4.5 hours later and sitting on the plane for 2.5 hours they have just told us again we are about 30 minutes from receiving an update. Not leaving! Just to receive an update. I will never fly this airline again. I do. It recommend this to anyone. The $50 you're saving is not worth it!,-1
2017-09-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,pay a little extra money,False," First time and last time flying Spirit. This is the worst airline I have ever flown. The tickets may look cheap right off the bat, but I promise you in the end they will be the same, if not more, than other airlines. They charge you for absolutely everything. Everyone I've known who has flown airlines has experienced hours of delays, including myself. I was supposed to leave for Las Vegas at 3:42 and instead got grounded for over 2 hours. Asked the cabin employees if we can at least purchase drinks and they told us no. Only way to get food or beverage was to de-board the airplane, which we were told the plane could leave at any moment and they would not wait for us. The seats themselves were small and cramped which was okay based on the cheap tickets, however like before-mentioned you pay for carry on bags, checked bags, food, all beverages, any changes, cancelled flights (even cancelled by the airline), and schedule changes. They give little updates on why you are delayed and how long you will be delayed. Take my advice and pay a little extra money for United or Alaska for way better service, more space, better employees and accurate updates.",-1
2017-09-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Horrible experience. Never again,False,"  Flew Spirit from Seattle to Los Angeles. Worst airline experience ever.

Everything, and I mean everything, is a la carte, so it's really not that ""low cost"". Our huge complaint in that we paid in advance to check three bags, but only needed to check two. They refused to credit us for one bag either way even though we did not actually check three bags. To make it worse, we were told by check-in agents to ""call customer service"" and they would adjust it. But when we called the next day, they would not credit us because we ""had already flown"". If we had known they would refuse to credit, we would have called the night before each flight to confirm baggage. But why should we have to do that when both check in clerks could see that we only had two bags? We will never fly Spirit again. What a racket.",-1
2017-09-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,first and likely last time,False,"  Boston to Minneapolis. Well at least we flew. Tried Spirit airlines for the first and likely last time. I fly over 125k a year for work and pleasure, usually try to book with my preferred however cost and direct flights over point. Booked via my credit card travel using points thinking it was a lower cost, addons for baggage I found out later made it not the case. After boarding we were told we'd have less than an hour delay for maintainence to a backup AC. 20 min later we were deplaned. No updates on status the first couple hours. Then people were harrassing the attendents for vague updates after. Happy we actually flew a little over 4 hours later. Used to delays, etc., however flying the bigger airlines they can usually get you out or find a plane quicker unless its a very small limited flight airport. Understand its a small airline trying to compete, but offers no value in cost, comfort, amenities or efficiency. My overall cost for what I got was higher for less than what I could have/should have for Sun Country or Delta.",-1
2017-09-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to New York,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,"Cheap tricks, same prices",False,"  Flew Fort Lauderdale to New York. Worst flight ever, after a great vacation, returning home on Spirit Airlines. Depart my vacation on a separate airline, great seats, baggage, customer service, even TV, snacks and refreshments. Spirit Airlines baggage charge 3 times the amount of previous airline ($241.00) for 4 pieces of luggage, girl at counter was rude, not very helpful. Company policy was the only response when asked about fees. Plane packed like sardines, seats small, uncomfortable and does not adjust (5' 9"", 180 pounds). Everything is a charge, including water. Avoid this airline if possible, spend your money wisely, you get what you pay for. Cheap tricks, same prices, only good thing was that we made it home safe.",-1
2017-09-04,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,Not my first or last flight on Spirit,False,"  Arrived at Logan about 90 minutes prior to my flight time. Had not checked in online at all. I also only had a small carry on, and knew that all the extras cost on this airline in return for a cheap flight. I checked in, printed my boarding pass, security line was a bit long, but got to my gate in short order. But, let me tell you about my flight! I got a window seat, but when I found a mom and son sitting in the window and middle seat, I sat on the aisle seat (my favorite). The flight crew could not have been more pleasant. Calmly explains to every single person who asked that yes, we do sell bottled water, drinks, snacks, it's how we keep the costs down. When we were about to hit turbulence during our descent into Orlando, the crew told us to buckle up. Flight was full and left about 10 minutes early! I may just join the Spirit club! Not my first or last flight on Spirit.",1

It seemed very unlikely to be on time for boarding. When waiting for emigration, I and the people in the same situation, ask for help to the Spirit agents without getting any useful answer, help or even comprehension. As I expected, I and a dozen of other people, missed our connection with no other flight going that night. I found myself stuck in Fort Lauderdale with no place to sleep and no assurance to get a flight the following day. I went to the main desk and got told that the next available flight was 4 days later… After 2 hours of discussion I was finally put on stand by for the flights departing on the following day but at this moment I am still in Fort Landerdale and still waiting. I also asked Spirit to pay for the hotel room I had to book in fort Landerdale that night but the supervisor didn’t seem the least concerned about my situation, barely listened to me when exposing my problem and didn’t suggest anything to help in anyway. It seemed to me that Spirit didn’t care at all about its customers and that getting passengers to their final destination is not a priority. About 20 people got stuck at the airport that night some with kids and the airlines wouldn't do anything to help saying that we should have seen that the connection time was too short when we booked the ticket eventhough the first plane was late. I would advise anyone to book another airline to avoid these frequent annoyances.",-1
2017-09-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to La Guardia,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly with this airline again,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to La Guardia. This was the worst experience ever. I arrived at the airport with an hour and half. I had already checked in on line as recommended by the website, however I never received my boarding passes even though I paid extra money for seats and carry on baggage. I was waiting on line for over an hour for an agent because the computers were down and could not do it by myself. There was a lot of chaos people yelling trying to get their tickets, and agents were very rude, every-time I tried to ask a question was told that they were busy or they had no knowledge and could not answer me. So ended up with 2 minutes left by the time I reach the gate only to find that the plane was leaving without us. It took another 2 hours before I could get anyone to help. I will never fly with this airline again.",-1

They appear to be cheap but nickel and dime you for every little convenience possible (i.e. legroom, luggage, a comfortable seat, etc..). We had the unfortunate luck of flying back to Houston the day Hurricane Harvey hit. I do understand that this was an unforeseen natural disaster however every single airline had the common sense to cancel the flight the night before. I called Houston airport and verified that all flights were cancelled except Spirit, so when I called Spirit they swore to me the flight was still on time. I called twice the night before and again early in the morning the day of. I checked out of my hotel room and drove 3 hours to the airport and returned my rental car. When I got to baggage check they then informed me the flight was delayed by only 1 hour. I explained again for the 4th time that a hurricane was happening in the area and all other flights were cancelled yet they said it was still going to happen. The time it took me to walk from security checkpoint to the gate is when they finally decided to cancel the flight. At this point I could not turn back without paying an arm and a leg. Had they cancelled the night before, I could have made appropriate arrangements with the hotel and the rental car and not driven 3 hours to get to the airport. When calling Spirit non-customer service they refused to compensate me for my inconvenience and added costs I had to pay to find my way back home.",-1

I was quite skeptical about flying Spirit airlines after reading many negative reviews. Let me say, this was one of my most pleasant flights. I did not seek out to fly Spirit airlines as I booked a vacation to Mexico through an online booking site. The flight crew on Spirit are hilarious. What you see is what you get. The flight attendant made an announcement to remind the guests that you're flying Spirit not delta. If you could afford delta you'd be popping bottles in first class. Too funny. Their drink prices are great, service was good and as a traveler who likes to go very nice places, I knew after I googled Spirit, that this would be a no frills flight. Don't expect peanuts or water for free. You get from point A to point B just like any other airlines however the comical value added by the staff offsets the small metal tray & a little less leg room. I may not necessarily ""seek out"" a flight on Spirit Airlines but it definitely was not as horrible as others have commented. My only suggestion would be to offer inflight wi-fi for purchase. Again, it's a what you see is what you get.",1
2017-09-02,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,flight attendants were nice,False," I was kind of nervous booking with Spirit due to so many negative reviews. My flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles was awesome. It was not delayed. We took off on time and arrived a tad earlier. The flight attendants were nice. I had enough room, I'm 5'9. The little snack deals were decent. Hope to have another great flight back in 3 days.",1
2017-08-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,I regret giving this company my money,False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Fort Lauderdale to Newark. This was the worst experience I've had. First of all, we had to deplane for 'they said 2 hours' but when we all got off, after 15 minutes they said we could board again. They rushed us all to board to then again sit on a plane for almost 40 minutes or more in the scorching heat. If they didn't have any power on the plane what was the rush to make us all board again everyone was sweating and uncomfortable. The staff while boarding were rude and were yelling at the passengers that it wasn't her problem. Honestly this flight might be a money saver but if you value your time and overal experience do not chose this airline. I regret giving this company my money.",-1
2017-08-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Cleveland,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,this airline is a joke,False,"  Flew Las Vegas to Cleveland. I had never heard anything good about Spirit Airlines but I wanted to give them a chance since there are limited choices to fly direct from Cleveland to Las Vegas. Since I am above average height, I paid for the option to select my seat (7C) which was near the front of the plane and on the aisle. I printed my boarding pass and waited at the gate. They began boarding the plane and when the agent scanned my boarding pass it was rejected. They re-assigned my seat (31B) to the last row, center without my knowledge. I questioned the agent and she literally screamed at me ""You printed your boarding pass before."" Whatever that means since my boarding pass was printed when I checked in. I chose not to escalate the situation but I want other travelers to know that this airline is a joke. I would choose Frontier all day over Spirit and I wish United Airlines would continue non-stop service.",-1
2017-08-30,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Boston,,,,,,,3.0,willing to give Spirit another try,False,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Boston. Printed boarding pass and reached DFW two hours before flight to find the 7am flight is cancelled due to crew no show (some strike). Good news is they put us on the AA flight two hours later. AA charged luggage fees again. Spirit re-imbursed all the luggage fees. Except for the hassle of change of flights and following up on re-imbursement (holding time of 30 minutes on the phone), it all worked fine. Though never got to fly Spirit, the baggage fees were returned and so I am ok with it and willing to give Spirit another try for the next destination. They also gave $50 voucher per passenger for the next trip.",1
2017-08-29,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,a very pleasant surprise,False," This was my first time flying Spirit Airlines. Keeping in mind that it is a low cost carrier and that I am reviewing it in this context, it was a very pleasant surprise. It's very similar to easyJet although probably not quite up to their level yet. The boarding process was very fast, the aircraft was a brand new A320 (it had Sharklets as opposed to fences). The interior is one big cabin with no dividers as it's all one class. The seats while spartan, are quite comfortable. The is no reclining feature but the angle is good enough for a comfortable ride for even a longer flight. The table is tucked away in your armrest which means that you cannot lie down even if you have all three seats to yourself, conversely, it also means that the person sitting next to you cannot infringe upon your space. Foods and drinks are for sale and almost everything other than the flight is an additional charge. Both the cabin crew and the cockpit crew were professional and friendly. Just before landing the cabin crew randomly selected a passenger to receive bonus points for future travel - not sure if they do this on all flights but it does add a nice touch to the whole trip. I was lucky in that I had the exit row to myself and that the aircraft had 64 empty seats. I suppose that most people book Spirit because it is cheap and they probably get upset if they have to sit on a full aircraft and have to pay for everything from seats to drinks. If you take it for what it is a method to get you from A to B fast and cheap Spirit Airlines is an excellent choice.",1

",False,"  I have never felt the need to write a bad review, but this is a situation I think people should know at they are getting. Spirit Airlines presents itself like a good deal, but it comes with fees for everything and is completely unreliable. They cancelled my flight from Dallas to Boston within 12 hours of boarding time and offered no further flights home for 2 days. At that point when I had to book with another company all the flights were x3 more expensive. Basically, Spirit said that's not their problem and better luck next time, and to add insult to injury ""here's $50 towards your next flight with us"". What? No, Spirit, never again.",-1
2017-08-27,0.9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Baltimore,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,,4.0,5.0,"professional crew, clean aircraft",False," I had many doubts about Spirit in the past. What I heard versus what I received were two completely different things. My experience was completely positive. Professional crew, clean aircraft and on-time boarding and early arrival at BWI. Although I didn't fly regular class, I flew on the Big Front Seat because I'm very tall (it's an awesome upgrade, by the way), I would definitely fly them again. The only thing I'd advise against is bringing your boarding pass on your phone. It is difficult to scan at TSA and at the gate. You can probably just ask the ticket desk to print one if you showed them you tried with the phone. That way you don't get stuck with the printing fee.",1
2017-08-25,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale return via Chicago,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,all of it was beyond great,False,"  Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale return via Chicago and all of it was beyond great.  I enjoyed the flight attendant on the last flight she was so entertaining and I just wanted to share that. I don't fly often but I sure hope if and when I do again I get someone equally as fun as her it just makes the whole process so much more enjoyable and my daughter is still laughing about how she told us to be careful when getting the luggage out of the overhead compartment because ""shift happens"". Thanks again we are looking forward to our next adventure and we will be using spirit I just know",1

I understood the seat is not comfortable but you pay is a less expensive fares unless if you want comfortable so just pay more fares then. I would recommend this airline.",1
2017-08-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,they really want you to have a bad experience,False,  Flew Detroit to Las Vegas. Spirit - where they really want you to have a bad experience. They are beyond rude at this locaton for no apparent reason. Their goal is only to find ways to charge you extra fees for whatever they can. I would rate this airline as the worst compared to all others that I have flown on. It is funny how everybody was talking about how they dislike Spirit and they really try to live up to everyone's poor expectations. Memo to self - fly with anybody other than Spirit Airlines.,-1
2017-08-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,there are lots of hidden fees,False,"  Las Vegas to Chicago. I spent nearly two hours trying to get my boarding pass to come up properly on my phone. I would get the email but no barcode, so panicking because I don't want to come here and pay 10-15 dollars for them to print it I have to constantly try and find a way to display it properly, too much work. They need to fix their boarding passes sent to emails. I am traveling with my family and all of our boarding passes are on my phone, I was told I wasn't allowed so and that everyone needed their own boarding passes which is outrageous. The seats don't incline at all, rude people who scan your tickets, and overall just not worth it. Base price of the ticket usually brings you in but what you'll soon find out is that there are lots of hidden fees after that you don't know about. Also waited an hour for my luggage at Las Vegas",-1
2017-08-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit Airlines again,False,"  I purchased 4 seats on a flight from Newark to Orlando. I contacted customer services to ensure that my 9 year old son would not be sitting alone and they wanted me to pay for 2 seats to ensure that he did not have to sit alone. 90% of the flight was vacant! Secondly, I received an email stating that my flight would be delayed by almost 2 hours which means that I will miss the event that I am traveling to. The representatives refused to take accountability and stated that they could not compensate me. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! I'd rather pay a few more dollars and fly Delta.",-1
2017-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Portland,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,cabin and seats are ridiculously uncomfortable,False,"  I only review companies if I had a really bad or really good experience. Our experience was horrible. Spirit nickel and dimes you for every little thing. Want to talk to a customer service agent? $10. Have a carry-on? $47. Want a soda during your flight? $3. You want to sit in a seat on the airline? $10-$40. I was afraid to use the bathroom in case they were charging for toilet paper. This is all in addition to the ticket you've already purchased. Stupid fees aside, the cabin and seats are ridiculously uncomfortable. They literally have you packed in like sardines. If you're over 5'7"" plan on having your knees in the back of the person in front of you. The seats are so close that they don't even recline, at all. If you have a mobile device of any kind, plan on charging it before you board, as there are no charging ports whatsoever. While the flight attendants were fine, the customer service people at the terminal were completely rude. Bad experience all around. Don't be fooled by a ""cheap"" ticket - they get you on all their other fees and it comes out the same as if you would fly a normal airline, you know, one with complimentary sodas and reclining seats.",-1
2017-08-21,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Dallas Fort Worth,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,I had a good experience,False,"  Los Angeles to Dallas Fort Worth. This was my first time flying Spirit Airlines. I was a bit hesitant flying with them since I had read the reviews online, but I still took the risk.  I had a good experience, the restrooms were clean. I was in LA for 5 days and I was able to fit all of my belongings in the personal bag were allowed which is pretty big. (I took a duffle bag). There is enough space in your seats to stretch your legs out , there is no tv or wifi. But that doesn't bother me. This airline is great to get you from point A to point B. I will be flying spirit again saved me about $160. I flew with 3 other people and we did not purchase seats so we automatically thought we were not going to sit together, but we all ended up sitting together. So I did not pay for seats nor my personal bag.",1

They were several hours late on both our flights, wrecking our plans and causing additional hotel stays. I literally got told by them ""We don't care. Do you want a refund or not?"" What seemed like a cheap deal just ended up an overpriced cattle hauler when you add all the basics to it and really expensive when you add their consistent delays. This is the second time I have made the mistake of attempting to travel with them and never ever again. Consistently late, consistently rude and consistently disgusting. Please do yourself a favor and spend the little extra and book on a proper airline.",-1
2017-08-20,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Terrible customer service,False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Detroit to Las Vegas. Flight there was ok, at least the stewardesses were pretty nice. Seats are so crowed and planes are dirty. On flight home from Vegas to Detroit, the stewardesses were so rude. No friendliness, no checking on guests, they congregated in the back of the plane and laughed and joked the whole trip. Came through and offered ""for purchase"" items right at beginning of flight and never again and it was 4 hr flight. Pilot never got on and shared any info with us, nothing! The toilet was dirty and they locked one of the back restrooms for their use only (the stewardesses). When they were back ""visiting"" they never even moved out of way for people to get through to use the restroom. A total awful experience. Terrible customer service.",-1
2017-08-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst flying experience,False,"  Seattle to Los Angeles. This was my first time flying with Spirit Airlines and was by far the worst flying experience I've ever had. My flight was scheduled to depart at 9:49am but was then delayed 3 times without any sort of explanation. The last delay was for 11:30am and then the flight was canceled. They sent us to the customer service check in desk with zero explanation as to why our flight was just canceled. With an entire planes worth of passengers sprinting through the Seattle airport towards the Spirit desk, there were only 2 customer service employees to ""help"". They were rude, provided no apology, and only offered a refund or to put us on a later flight. An understandably upset customer asked when the next flight with a different airline was and the customer service employee yelled back ""I dont know, google it."" The next Spirit airlines flight to Los Angeles was for the following week; I ended up getting a different flight through two separate airlines, but it included a layover in San Francisco. There was no compensation whatsoever for the hassle and inconvience. I will never be flying with Spirit airlines again no matter how cheap the ticket is.",-1
2017-08-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to New Orleans,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,can Spirit explain this to me?,False," Checking in online for the outbound flight, I am paying for 1 checked bag RT (2x$42.00=$84.00) and seat each way (6C outbound flight, 5C return flight, 2x$20.00=$40.00): total $124.00. Instead of a boarding pass I get a printable page with the message “Minor detected”. The same message page I get when trying to check in online for the return flight. Trying to check in at the airport I am offered to pay again for a seat and I chose random seat. Instead of a boarding pass I get a printout saying to see an agent. I tell the agent about the prepaid seat and she told me that my card was not charged for that so I get a random seat (10E). Two days later, I see the charges of $124.00 on my credit card. Can anyone at Spirit Airlines explain this to me?",-1
2017-08-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Ft. Lauderdale,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,staff was picking and choosing,False,"  La Guardia to Ft. Lauderdale. My fault in missing my original flight. As that's it frustrating enough, service from Spirit Airlines staff, (ground and phone service) was terrible. I paid an extra $300 for standby and was not prioritized for the available seating for several flights after my missing flight. Other standbyers that missed their flight as well were placed in front of us after we checked in before them. I feel ground staff agents was picking and choosing on who should be on the next flights. also picked and choose who should pay or not pay. Spoke to ground supervisor and called Spirit Airlines supervisor to verbalize my concern and frustration and they were dismissive to my complaints. Was told ""there's nothing we can do"". We were at the airport over 24 hrs by the time we were considered and placed for the final flight of the day. We were a family of 4 traveling, agent rescheduled 3 of us separate from my 11 year old son, he was rescheduled on a flight without my acknowledgement. How can they book an 11 year old on their own with out an adult companion? Too many discrepancies on this trip. Along with constant delayed flights that caused inconvenience to passengers.",-1
2017-08-15,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Baltimore,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,5.0,3.0,Inflight Service: Prompt and efficient,False,"  Route: Baltimore to Chicago / Return From Chicago to Baltimore (no connections). Aircraft: Airbus A320. The airplane was very clean and well maintained. Seats: I am 6' 1"" tall. The seats had 28"" pitch but were very comfortable. The seats do not recline, which is fine by me. In seating with larger pitches that recline, when the passenger in front of you reclines the seat invades your space and makes for a cramped feeling, forcing you to also recline to gain back the space. With Spirit, since the seats do not recline, the closer pitch (space between the seats) is actually more comfortable. Leg room is still adequate, and I can cross my legs, etc. 2 extra inches of leg room simply does not compensate for the person in front of you reclining his seat back into your face. In addition, a great many of higher priced airlines have equal seating pitch to Spirit. I have to rate overall seat comfort on Spirit as superior to most other higher priced airlines for economy classes. Inflight Entertainment: None - but I have flown more expensive airlines with the same amenities, that is, none. Today, fliers are becoming more reliant on their smart phones and notebook computers, and do not use inflight entertainment. I did not notice onboard electrical outlets on my flight (but did not look for them), so make sure your personal devices are charged when you get onboard. Ground Service: Efficient. The personnel behind the baggage drop at Baltimore were professional and efficient. They were not chipper and friendly, but it was 4.35am, so I will cut them some slack. The personnel at Chicago were efficient, professional, and had a positive demeanor at 6.35am. Flight Crew: Outstanding. They were efficient, courteous, and had a great sense of humor while maintaining great professionalism. They actually got me to pay attention to the inflight safety demonstration which I have not done in decades. We arrived in Chicago 30 minutes early, and communications from the flight deck was outstanding. Inflight Service: Prompt and efficient. Yes, water, sodas, and coffee costs $2.00, and they do not give you a small bag of peanuts or pretzels. But you can bring your own, if you like. However, beer, wine, liquor, and onboard snacks are less expensive than most higher priced airlines I have flown on recently by a dollar or two. Boarding and Deplaning: This I really liked. Many people complain they have to pay for carry-on baggage. This is because all airlines have, for quite a while now, forced passengers to pay for checked baggage. Spirit does, too, and more than most airlines, plus the weight limit is only 40lbs, so be careful. Spirit also makes passengers pay for carry-on bags. The difference in costs, however, is small, so most passengers just go ahead and pay to check baggage. The great thing is, with no carry-ons to stick in the overhead compartments, people just walk on to take their seats, and walk off, with no waiting for people to fiddle with their luggage. It's how flying used to be. Overall: This airline is not for everyone. It is not for people with lots of luggage. It does not have alliances with other carriers, so if there are problems, they cannot transfer your booking and you are stuck. It is not for people who do not expect, understand or accept the concept of low priced carriers and the a la carte paying structure. Most of the problems I see in reviews I have experienced with other airlines that put an extra zero on my airfare.",1
2017-08-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Seattle,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Terrible value for money,False,"  Terrible value for money. Your ticket is barely cheaper than other airlines, and you have to pay extra for carry ons, personal items, no complementary snacks, etc etc. And on top of that, you will sit in a small, cramped seat because it is a ""budget airline."" On my flight from Los Angeles to Seattle, I was asked to move to a new seat so that they could reseat someone else and I complied. They later announce on the flight that one random seat will win a free one-way ticket. It turned out to be my original seat that I was assigned. So if I had not cooperated, then I would have been rewarded with a free ticket. But since they re-seated me, someone else got the ticket. This airline always leaves late. Never on time from my experience. Never flying Spirit again!",-1
2017-08-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Punta Cana via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly with them again,False,"  Denver to Punta Cana via Ft Lauderdale. Horrible - will never fly with them again, and I warn everyone against doing so. I booked 2.5 months in advance, paid $170 extra for carry-on and seat assignment (I'm tall and require leg room, 6'5"" 170lbs). Of all 4 flights during this trip, 3/4 were delayed (paperwork coming from corporate was a frequent excuse). The other flight was cancelled. This was my return from a resort in the Dominican Republic. Spirit cited weather in Florida, however the radar was only ""green"" severity storms, absolutely typical for an afternoon in August for Florida. The airport did not close, other airlines remained flying, other Spirit flights remained flying into Ft Lauderdale. I believe this excuse is purely a lie and have found nothing online to verify it. Once my flight was cancelled, I was rebooked on multiple other flights including one 36 hours after my original departure (getting me home to Denver 48 hrs late). Customer service stated they do not rebook passengers on other airlines, they do not provide overnight accommodations, meals or added transportation. I was told escalation was pointless and that no one would be able to help get me out of a foreign country. I've emailed executives (CEO email format is invalid), but found senior customer service emails online.",-1

When I tried to check in online with one piece of luggage, I was prompted to pay $114. I thought it was a mistake so I went to the airport to get it done. With them chosing my seat, I ended up paying $97 (this is them honoring the online discounted price as a courtesy). Not affordable! As though they didn't get to squeeze enough out of me, they tried to charge me for my laptop bag at the gate. I ended up not paying because several people in line got upset about it. The rep who mentioned paying wasn't even the one who quelled the situation. He was too busy showing authority. I have never had such an experience in my life. The customer service reps were rude and condescending. The ones in Montego Bay are the worst I've ever seen. They behave as though it is a trend to be nasty toward customers. It is not possible for one to even pay me to fly with these people ever again. I will make sure to warn everyone that I hear mentioning flying that they should avoid Spirit Airlines at all cost. By the way, don't even think about getting thirsty. You have to pay for the water.",-1

Lost one day of vacation. A flight which was supposed to be 1.5 hours took me 8 hours after having a layover in Myrtle Beach. As consumption they apparently gave me a $100 voucher which I could use for my next flight. As I tried to use the voucher it came out that this voucher cannot be used on every flight and is just reducing the base fair or whatever. At the end this voucher was nothing worth. I will definitely never fly Spirit Airlines again.,-1
2017-08-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to La Guardia via Dallas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worth paying a little extra,False," I should have done my homework on this airline, but I had to book last minute business travel myself from Los Angeles to La Guardia via Dallas. I will never fly Spirit again. When I checked my bag they made no mention of the fact that I would have to exit to baggage claim to pickup my bag during my connection. Due to the late arrival of my flight, I now have to sit outside for 4 hours until security reopens at 4 AM, check my bag again, and go through security once again. Flying is bad enough these days, but the way they do business is ridiculously inconvenient, and it's definitely worth paying a little extra to never deal with this again.",-1

We were told we would be boarding at 3:15. By 3:30 we were told plane was in SC and we are in PA, but it is broken down, so we are delayed over 4 hrs and the airline has done nothing. I called their customer care, nothing. I asked to talk to a supervisor and nothing. They want to give us a $50 voucher to fly with them again. I urge you to not go cheap, because that's what you get. Thanks Spirit for shortening our vacation! And to the booking agent that told me you are fortunate to even be able to take a vacation, I can't take one. Just now someone came up to tell us that there's nothing else she could do, nothing. Just sad that we have to put up with this and nothing anyone can do about it.",-1

My flight from Oakland to Detroit got delayed for almost 29 hours.

2017-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,Spirit was a huge mistake,False,"  Seattle to Baltimore. Both in-flight crews (going to and from Seattle) were excellent, but absolutely everything else about Spirit stunk. They advertise cheap flights, and while the original base price was low, by the time everything else was added it was just as expensive as any other airline. This would not have been so bad if the customer service and the aircraft quality would have made up for it. On the planes themselves, all they have as a 'seatback pocket' is a rubber band to hold everything in place. When making my reservation, I didn't care what seat I had as long as it wasn't an emergency exit seat, and yet it would not let me through to finish processing my reservation unless I chose a seat--for which I had to pay hundreds of additional dollars. Granted, most airlines charge for sending luggage through and even for carry-on luggage nowadays, but it was way overpriced. Don't become thirsty while you're onboard, because if you even want so much as water you have to pay extra for that too. I am visually impaired and needed assistance navigating the terminals and retrieving my luggage. The first skycap I encountered (I can't even say who helped me because she didn't) at SeaTac Airport had no clue where anything was, or how to use the phone system to call for an airport shuttle to my hotel. Besides this, she 'tried' to guide me by yanking on and pulling me by the white cane I use in order to navigate my environment. The ticketing people at Spirit shut their counter down in the middle of the day on a weekend at the height of tourist season in a town (Seattle) where many people choose to travel, leaving customers who want to even ask simple questions stuck for hours. Two out of three ticket counter agents employed by Spirit don't even know where their own staff area is. Flying on Spirit was a huge mistake I will never make again.",-1
2017-08-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Managua to San Diego via Ft Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a cheap airline and you pay for it,False,"  Managua to San Diego via Ft Lauderdale. Our flight was delayed due to air traffic and ""weather"". We arrived at Florida 30 minutes late, and our connecting flight was already closed and ready for departure. We have global entry passes so we went through customs faster than everyone else and when we arrived at the recheck luggage counter the Spirit representative told us it was not their fault since it was out of their control. We argued that they booked the connecting flight too close to our arrival, but she said it was not their problem and there was nothing we could do except re book our flight for the next day at 6pm, with no accommodations since ""it was not their fault."" Or we could get a refund of a portion of our flight and then we could try to get another airline to take us since they did not have any seats available to our destination for that day. She was very inconsiderate to our dilemma. We had a red eye flight and we were exhausted, we told her we wanted to speak to the manager and she sent us to the check-in counter. When we arrived there, and asked to speak to the manager, they made us go through the check-in line. It was so frustrating that no one showed the least empathy for our plight. Finally after waiting for people to check in, we got to speak to a representative that was able to find available seats to our destination for that day. We are currently waiting for that flight. We need to wait for about 11 hours until the next flight. After we had changed our tickets and were ready to get something to eat, I noticed there was an email rescheduling all of the connecting flights we were supposed to get, I guess they decided to change the connecting flight time after all, since this was clearly their fault. Of course, it was too late for my wife and myself to go back and try to catch this flight. Again, very frustrating! This is a cheap airline and you pay for it in ways that you do not expect. We will not use this airline again, their customer service is terrible! There was no compensation of any kind for what we consider to be something they are clearly responsible for: booking a flight too close to the connecting flight time. With United and American, we have never experienced this problem. I guess we will stick to paying a little bit extra for a lot better service.",-1
2017-08-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Seattle,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,extremely disappointed on all aspects,False,"  Flew Las Vegas to Seattle. This is by far the worst experience I have had with an airline. I fly roughly once a month for work and decided to try this airline out on a package deal I got off of travelocity. When I left Seattle they let my bag (roughly 53 lbs) on with no problem other than the ridiculous $44 baggage fee. Once boarded the seats were extremely uncomfortable, they do not recline and were dirty and the staff were rude. They charge for absolutely everything including water. They ask you to pick up any garbage. They claim you can only bring on a laptop bag or purse for no charge but customers were carrying backpacks. On our way home the airline told me my bag was 17 lbs over weight. And only 40 lbs was allowed. Granted I left Seattle at 53 with no charge. They more or less said I was a liar and could not help me. They said it was going to cost me $55 additional dollars to check my bag. I took a few things out to get it to the 51 lbs and they still charged me $35. They blamed Seattle Airport for not charging me properly. They claim to want to keep the flights cheap but they are nickel and diming you. I was extremely disappointed on all aspects.",-1
2017-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,flight had been canceled without any reason,False,"  Normally I fly Delta Airlines, since Delta does not fly direct flight from Los Angeles to Chicago O'Hare, I bought a ticket from Spirit Airlines. The day before my flight, I got an email that the flight had been canceled without any reason. So I called their 800 number and got put on hold multiple times to get to the supervisor. Unable to help and understand the situation. They only give refunds on one way only. I had to buy a ticket on United Airlines at a much higher price, Spirit will not reimburse the difference at all. Very courteous supervisor but Spirit management is the one to blame for bad service.",-1
2017-08-04,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Seattle,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,"the seats were tight, broken and dirty",False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Atlanta to Seattle. This is the most unorganized business I had seen in a long time. The schedule was undetermined throughout my travel. They double booked seats. Charges for everything (bags, water, seats) and the seats were tight, broken and dirty. Not a good flying experience. It certainly is a bait and switch marketing technique. The website is also terrible. Just be aware that cheap rates end up being higher than a reputable airline.",-1
2017-08-03,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Baltimore,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I didn't have any issues whatsoever,False,  This was my first time flying with Spirit Airlines from Las Vegas to Baltimore and I was nervous to say the least because of all the bad reviews and horror stories about this airline. My experience was excellent. I already knew I had to pay for my bags so I did that online to save money. I printed my own boarding pass. So once I got to the airport I didn't have any issues whatsoever. The flight was on time to and from my destination. I even purchased the big seats so I was comfy. To me they're cheaper even with having to pay for bags and seats. I would fly with them again.,1
2017-08-02,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,2.0,too cheap on the seating,False,"  Phoenix to Dallas Ft Worth. Gave Spirit Airlines a trial run since I was booking last minute. The seats are so incredibly uncomfortable; hard, too short (the seat barely went to the 1/2 way point on my legs!), unforgiving. I paid for an ""upgraded"" seat but it was only a seat closer to the front, not an actual upgrade - do not fall into this trap. Also, I thought the seat I upgraded to was surrounded by open seats (thus the selection); it was not. Kudos for trying to be innovative by paying for only what you need - but when you get too cheap on the seating, well, that's a bigger problem. You can literally see the seat frames on the backside - do not let the pictures they post entice you as they are very deceiving. The poor gate agent; rather than helping us board, he also had to be the bag monitor; ""did you pay for that bag, sir?"" The flight was on time and everyone was kind. The 8 seats in front that are about $45 more might be worth it - might. They were at least longer!",-1
2017-08-01,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Dallas,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,4.0,We had no problems flying,False,"  Chicago to Dallas. I am writing this review to counteract the bad ones. We had no problems flying from O'hare to DFW and back. In fact, the aisles are wider and I had more leg room than on other airlines because I sat in the emergency row. No one likes fees and free pretzels would have been nice but I survived. The service was comparable to United or Delta. Pleasant and nice. In fact, our flight arrived early at the destination and the terminal was still full from another plane. There was around a 10 minute delay because they let 4 people on the plane late! Wow! I am applying for a credit card which gives you a free flight from the beginning. I'm not sure if we got really lucky but would fly again. Maybe the new CEO is turning everything around.",1
2017-08-01,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,4.0,I would choose them again!,False,"  Newark to Orlando. I read the reviews and personally was wondering what I got myself into. I guess that I was one of the lucky ones. My flight left on time, arrived early and my bag which I thought may need to be paid for was accepted no problem. The seats weren't luxurious but I wasn't expecting that anyway. The staff was friendly and professional. My only surprises were that I had to pay extra for my seat after my original purchase and had an issue with pre check in (in my 50s so that may have played a part). I would choose them again!",1
2017-07-31,0.1,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1.0,feel swindled out of my money,False,"  I flew on Flight 949 from Los Angeles to Oakland at 6:00 AM on July 24th, 2017. I don't expect too much from flying Spirit. I did feel swindled out of my money for Carry-on and Seat Upgrade charges. The website showed only a small purse as a Personal Item and I felt obligated to pay additional fees for my small backpack, as backpacks were pictured on your website as carry-on items. I feel this was a scam because several people had bigger bags than me and didn't pay for them. Secondly, the Seat Upgrade to seat 3D was a joke. The seat was dilapidated and dirty. I also flew from Oakland to Los Angeles at 9:10 PM. This flight was worse! First we waited and waited for 16 late passengers to board. Other airlines would have left as a courtesy to the passengers that were on time. Secondly, some woman was allowed to sit in an upgraded seat 2C that she did not pay for. I clearly heard her ask the person in the row if anyone was sitting there and once he said no, she sat down. The Flight Attendant later asked her if she had paid for the seat and she said yes. Isn’t there a list that they could check and see the truth? Why am I paying $56 each way and this woman sits for free? As we took off, my 3D seat slowly reclined and would not stay in the upright position. I originally purchased my flights with Spirit and was pleased with the price I paid. After all the upgrade fees I paid coupled with my bad experiences on both flights, I don’t think I will ever return to Spirit. Way too many issues to have to deal with.",-1
2017-07-29,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,I had absolutely no problems,False,"  Before booking my flight from Atlanta to Chicago with Spirit I checked reviews and there was 98 percent bad and 2 percent good. I was very hesitant to book, but I did and have no regrets. Spirit is upfront at the beginning that your ticket includes you and 1 small personal item. I see so many people complaining about no inflight entertainment, and paying for food? What? It's a flight, not a all inclusive resort. It's intended to get you to and from your destination. Overall I had absolutely no problems flying with Spirit and will continue to keep flying with them.",1
2017-07-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,the most unprofessional airline,False,"  New Orleans to Fort Lauderdale. I booked with Spirit Airlines because of the incredibly cheap prices compared to other airlines. I was supposed to fly from New Orleans to Ft Lauderdale using spirit and then had a connecting flight from Ft Lauderdale to Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Island using another airline. Twelve hours before I was getting ready to leave, I received an email stating my flight had been cancelled by Spirit. I searched for another flight to get to Ft.Lauderdale every where but the flights available did not coincide with my connecting flight. A Caribbean vacation completely ruined. My whole vacation has to be rescheduled. I called Spirit Airlines and they are issuing a full refund but of course that takes 7-10 business days. This is the most unprofessional airline I have ever dealt with. Everything cheap is not good. I will never use this airline again. Oh, they did send a $50 voucher for my ""inconvenience"", which was pointless because I won't be booking with them again after this nightmare experience. Guys pay the extra to fly with a more reliable airline.",-1

Spirit has the worst customer service at the highest prices. This is the last time I will fly with them. At the counter where I checked my bag, Spirit reps were calling each other names, joking,, being rude and unprofessional. The flight was delayed by 1 hr with zero notice, but had the audacity to ask ypu to come 2 hrs prior to boarding. And they charged me $52 dollars for 1 checked bag.",-1
2017-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Seattle,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,1.0,Customers pay for everything,False,"  Flew IAH (Houston) to SEA (Seattle). Seven departure time changes = 3 hours delay! Two gate changes. An 11.45 pm arrival time became almost a 3 am arrival time! Customers pay for everything, including water. Spirit Airlines sent a ""complimentary"" receipt (really?). When I say everything, I mean everything. Additionally, they airlines changed the luggage requirements after I made my reservations. Horrible. Also, one of the gates they moved us to was too small - people had to sit on the floor.",-1
2017-07-27,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Florida to Newark,4.0,,3.0,,,2.0,2.0,This is my last time,False,"  I had a horrible experience during my departure from Orlando Florida, flight 140. My flight was scheduled to leave at 12.11 pm. The initial delay was scheduled for 3.45 pm. The plane started boarding and half way through the boarding process we were told that Spirit Airlines were having issues and everyone needed to get off. At approx. 3.40 pm we were notified that the flight was being delayed again for approx. 6.45 pm and that this time was an estimated time. The flight attendant could not assure me that the flight was leaving at that time and offered to put me on a confirmed flight leaving the next day at 10 am. She said that Spirit dose not give out hotel vouchers so this option was not good for me. I purchased insurance on my flight so I asked for a refund so I could schedule a flight out on another airline, she said the refund would take two days to show up on my card so this option was not good either. This is after waiting for hours. I asked them why was the flight delayed again and I was told that the air traffic in Newark was very busy and many of the flights leaving Orlando was delayed. They asked us to sand by and do not leave the area, It was taking a long time so I asked again ""what is the hold up?"" I was told that it was thunder and lightening and that we could not leave. Another time I overheard then telling someone else it was raining really hard in Newark. Please note that I had a 7 year old child with me and this was becoming very stressful. Needless to say we watched other airlines pull out of the airport during our waiting process. When we finally left at 6.45 pm everyone was happy because the uncertainty was becoming frustrating. When we arrived to Newark Airport there were a mob of people waiting for our flight to arrive, I guess because our delay affect them. While walking through Newark Airport I noticed that Spirit Airlines had the only flights that were delayed. I have flown Spirit Airlines many times and never had this problem. However, some of the customers were saying that this happens every time they fly Spirit and there never flying Spirit again. This is my last time as well. I was very nervous that my granddaughter and I would be spending the night in the airport because it was too expensive for us to leave at that point.",-1
2017-07-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Costa Rica via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,ruined an entire day of our 5 day vacation,False,"  Flew Baltimore to Costa Rica via Fort Lauderdale. The worst airline experience I have ever had. Our flight was for around 7.30am. They first delayed it until 8.30, then delayed it until 9.30, and then at 9.30 cancelled it for no reason. There was an entire line of people at the gate waiting to board confused as to why it was cancelled. I heard Spirit employees showing attitude to people who were rightfully annoyed about their cancelled flight. After waiting in line at the gate from 9.30am-11.30am, we finally got to the podium and they put us on an American Airlines flight with a 12 hour layover in a city we didn't want to go to! Spirit ruined an entire day of our 5 day vacation, didn't reimburse our hotel room for the night, and I even had to call to get them to refund our bag fees for the flight we didn't even take! On our return flight home, we stood in the check-in line for 2 hours. I watched as the Southwest line next to us just breezed through the check in process and cleared everyone out quickly. We finally checked in and boarded the plane on time (a miracle!). But, we knew it was too good to be true and Spirit was going to mess something up. We ended up sitting on the runway for over an hour because ""the computers were slow and they were manually inputting data"". These people can't get anything right! Also note that the seats on the plane do not recline, water is not free on board, and after bag fees and seat fees Spirit is not even cheaper than Southwest. Do yourself a favor and pay extra money to avoid this airline. The funny thing is Spirit did give me a $50 voucher as an apology, but is worth absolutely nothing to me. I will never fly Spirit again.",-1

Absolutely the worst airline I have ever flown from all the fees to every flight being delayed. I usually fly Southwest and thought I would give Spirit Airlines a try, I will never fly this airline again. They charge you for everything, even coffee, snacks, drinks and your seat. Their bag fees are ridiculous, staff are rude and have no idea what they are doing I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

I got all emails about checking in online, pay for your baggage online it's cheaper, print your boarding passes it's faster. Did all of that and at 6am this morning I get an email that the flight was cancelled. I called and found out they didn't have enough crew. How they don't have enough crew to work their planes that they knew was leaving? I'll never book with them again.",-1
2017-07-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,she disregarded my position,False,"  Baltimore to Las Vegas. I needed a quick get away and found a return trip ticket on Spirit Airlines online. The advertised price was for $299, but with all the add-ons which included ""paper boarding card"" charge, I paid $398.19. Got to the airport and the attendant guaranteed that I could get my return boarding card in Vegas on my return. I was charged for my little carry-on, seat on the plane (even though I didn't request special seating), checking in at the airport. Got on the plane, seats were crammed like sardines. Fast forward to my return, on the day I was meant to return, I realised I didn't get an airline notification like I would from my preferred airline, so I called Spirit to figure out what was going on. To my surprise, i was told that my ticket was a one way ticket, and if i wanted to make it back to MD, i had to buy a one way ticket for almost $400. I contested this over the phone and was advised to speak with a manager at the airport, as I couldn't speak with a manager over the phone. Got to the airport 7 hours before the take off time (because I was desperate to catch the redeye flight out as I had to be at work in the morning), the manager told me that if I was to be in MD, I had to buy a one way ticket. I pulled up a similar advertised return flight for $259, and showed the manager that this was not fair to advertise a price and swap terms after purchase, she disregarded my position. With no choice, I grudgingly paid for a one way leg home, but I will never forget this experience.",-1
2017-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Detroit,,,,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly Spirit again,False,"  Tampa to Detroit. Kept delaying flight with several excuses : Odor on plane, maintenance issue, ac issue - they boarded passengers just to make them get off the plane 5 minutes later. Then they announced the crew had now ""timed out"" and was going home! Then they announced they may have another crew from incoming flight to take over. Then the announcement that one of the flight attendants from that crew was sick and they cannot fly with incomplete crew. Finally at midnight (when it was too late to get re-booked with another airline) the flight gets cancelled, But we can fly out the next day, from another airport that is only 1 hrs and 45 min away! Unprofessional, dishonest and will never fly Spirit again. I flew with them many times before and was used to rude treatment and being squeezed together like sardines but this broke the camels back.",-1

Worst airline ever, asked for water and was told I would have to pay and instead offered me some free ice. Seats are extremely uncomfortable, staff are horrible.

I am getting the run around about a refund. $60 for a carry on duffle bag? Give me a break. Pay for seats again after I bought seats? Ridiculous. Pay extra to board a little earlier? First and last time I will book with Spirit if I don't get some type of customer service! I understand issues happen, but a little information and some help would have been appreciated. Then being told someone will contact me in 72 hours about a refund!? They sure took my money right away!",-1

When we finally landed they held us in the plane for an extra 30 minutes as apparently there was no open gate. Not only was I going to miss my connecting flight but the gate we were waiting on was my flight so I ended up watching my next flight take off. I'm now spending the night at the airport as that was the last flight to Detroit and construction is preventing me from sleeping. I'm surprised there's no complementary water or snacks for passengers. Carry on along with printing boarding passes costs a pretty penny. Never flying Spirit again.",-1

I was able to contact customer service via phone and book on flight connecting in Ft Lauderdale. Phone agent assured me my bag was redirected to new flight, gate agent reassured me my bag was redirected to new flight. I landed in Atlanta at 1am and no bag. I was told it was confirmed my bag will land in Atlanta today. I arrived to the airport, I have waited for an hour and baggage claim agent still don't know where my bag is: Puerto Rico, Orlando or Ft Lauderdale. The baggage claim agent has little customer service skills and won't answer with a direct answer any direct questions I have made. Would never fly Spirit again.",-1

Got an email on my way to the airport saying my flight from Orlando to New Orleans was canceled. After calling the airline, their solution to my problem was flying me the next day to Houston, with no connections to New Orleans or a voucher which didn't include the money I had spent on a checked bag.

2017-07-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Los Angeles,,,,,,,1.0,customer services inexistent,False,"  Chicago to Los Angeles. I had to cancel my flights and emailed Spirit and explained our situation - again and again. The only response I ever received - twice - was an automatic link to provide feedback on how well their Customer Services Department had performed when responding to my query! To think that I bought a ticket with an airline whose customer services are so inexistent. Having failed by email, I tried to call, but the given numbers won’t work from France. The final frustration came when cancelling the flight. I already knew they were planning to rip me off out of all but $70 from my initial $350 bill. Imagine how I felt when I discovered that the $70 refund has 'so generously' been given as a credit note. The USA is famous for providing good customer services but Spirit Airlines seems to be the exception that proves the rule. In the end, via the Internet, I found a US +801 number that worked and spoke to someone, and I asked him for someone's personal Spirit email address as no other email worked. I politely insisted, explaining that calling from France was too expensive to explain all I needed to by phone. After a short pause, I was placed on hold and left there. So, after 2 minutes, I hung up.",-1

Booked a last minute flight because the price seemed right. After all the shenanigans I was better off paying the extra $100 to fly American, United or even Southwest! $38 each way for a carry on bag or $47 for a checked bag, $10 to print a boarding pass at the airport, $12-$25 to choose a seat, $6 for priority boarding. I received emails at least 12 hours prior to my flights stating they were already delayed! 1.5 hours on my outbound trip and I'm up to 2.5 hours so far on the return. The flight itself was uneventful and the staff was fairly pleasant. Oh, not even so much as complimentary water in flight. You will pay for any and all refreshments. Luckily I only had a 2 hour non stop flight but I will probably not be choosing this airline again. I will gladly play a little extra for piece of mind!",-1

My fiancé and I were on the way to the airport for our New York to Ft Lauderdale flight and received an email stating the flight will be delayed. Last minute updates have horrible domino effects on destination reservations. Needless to say their luggage limit is only 40lbs for check in luggage. Spirit is like Five Guys, you pay for everything separate, even after paying your air fare, an option comes up to pay for seating, if you desire a specific seat on the flight. There are so many additional fees, its ridiculous. Then on our way back home, of course we get that infamous update email from Spirit telling us our flight will 45mins delayed. Once again all arrangements made for pickup have to be revised. So inconvenient. I've heard stories about Spirit Airlines never leaving on time and I am here to confirm. So if you don't mind getting to your destination when they feel like getting you there, then all means book your flight.",-1

I was stuck in the middle of the night and they didn't even offer to help in any way. While I was delayed, two other Spirit flights were also delayed for a very long time.

They cancelled our flight from Orlando FL to Atlantic City NJ, claiming it was ""weather related."" Meanwhile every other airline was deporting and arriving, including Spirit who was arriving. An hour later Spirit sent out a flight to Atlanta, and claimed they couldn't send our flight out still because it was still ""weather related."" After requesting to speak with the manager, the airline called the cops instead. One hour later, we finally talked to the manager where they refused to give us a hotel to stay in, a rental car, or a refund. Not to mention the next available flight for Spirit is Thursday (two days later)! So they expect us to pay for a hotel for the next 2 nights, and a rental car. In order to get home tomorrow we had to get a flight with United at 6am to Newark, where I'll have to catch a ride and get dropped off at Atlantic City to pick up my car.

Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,cancellation added $1000 to the real cost,False," Nothing to see here folks, just another vacation damaged - and nearly doubled in cost - by Spirit. Bought tickets as part of a vacation package in the Dominican Republic. The airline cancelled the flight on the morning of our departure. When we called them to try to get another flight, they offered one leaving two days later. No, you didn't misread that last sentence: two days later. The resort days had already been purchased of course, and days off work had already been scheduled--half the vacation was effectively cancelled. The usual offer of a $50 voucher to apologize. They have promised to refund the flight, but even if it goes through, it will not even begin to offset the cost of the last-minute one-way flights we had to buy from another airline. All in all, the cancellation added $1000 to the real cost of the trip - nearly the same as what we paid for the vacation package in the first place. In future, we will not use this airline. You shouldn't either - not if you want to enjoy your vacation without discovering, on day one of the trip, that it's almost twice as expensive as you thought.",-1
2017-07-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Atlanta,,,,,,,1.0,the flight was cancelled,False,"  Houston to Atlanta. Received an email 9 hours before the flight was scheduled to take off that the flight was cancelled. No crew available! Next available flight was the next day. What irritates me was the wording ""if this interrupts your traveling plans please call this number."" How does this not interrupt travel plans for anyone?",-1
2017-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to La Guardia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,First and last time!,False,"  First and last time! I had booked two tickets from La Guardia to Chicago O’Hare this past weekend with Spirit Airlines. I have heard some of the horror stories with Spirit, but I thought “Hey it’s only a two-hour flight, how bad could it be?”. Our flight out of LGA, was delayed for at least two hours, with no explanations from staff, nothing. The level of incompetence with these people is totally unacceptable. We finally get on the flight and I could not believe how small the seats were. Fast forward, our return flight, first flight out in the morning at 5:55am was cancelled at least 10 minutes prior to boarding. The level of miscommunication with Spirit staff is unreal! No one knew anything about why it was cancelled. We got rebooked onto another flight, this time with a connection. The flight was delayed for 2 hours. Cancellations and Delays should be the motto.",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never use Spirit Airlines again,False,"  Detroit to Las Vegas. I will never use Spirit Airlines again. Two friends and I were confirmed on a flight from Detroit to Las Vegas, departing Saturday 8:15pm. We planned two full days in Vegas, returning Tuesday morning. At 5:00pm Spirit sent an e-mail stating the flight to Vegas was on time. We arrived at the terminal early and at 6:45pm received another e-mail saying our flight was being delayed for 1-1/2 hours. We waited 1-1/2 more hours only to receive another e-mail saying our flight had been cancelled. Spirit automatically booked us on flights leaving the next day. They put my two friends on a different flight leaving in the morning. They put me on another flight scheduled 9 hours later, totally unacceptable! I tried to change to the flight my friends were on but Spirit said that flight was completely sold out. I asked why our flight was cancelled and she said something about “crew”. They could say anything really but it wouldn’t matter - lack of crew, maintenance, mechanical failure, etc. In my opinion, I don’t think they had enough passengers to make it profitable. That’s when I asked for a full refund. The Spirit representative on the phone offered no apologies, alternatives or compensation. She sounded impatient and cancelled my itinerary within minutes. She also told me it will take another 10 days to process my refund. No more Spirit for me !!",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to New Orleans,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,3 hours delayed and counting,False," Spirit Airlines is the worst. They canceled my flight from Ft Lauderdale to New Orleans. We had to wait for the next scheduled flight. It seems like they canceled because it wasn't fully sold because there was only about 20 people that had to join the next flight of the day there. Now, on my way home to New Orleans, we are over 3 hours delayed and counting. Just hoping I can ever get home. I will never fly this airline again.",-1
2017-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,very displeased with the service,False," I'm am very dissatisfied with Spirit Airlines. First off I experienced delays on my first flight from Newark to Orlando, then on my return flight to Newark I not only experienced delays, but the flight was subsequently cancelled with no justifiable explanation. I am very displeased with the service provided.",-1
2017-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,profits over basic customer needs,False," I'll not fly Spirit airlines again. The airline routinely cancels flights due to maintenance issues and offers little to nothing to accommodate passengers. This is a reflection of poor management and lack of ability to run a professional business. My recent experience: Houston to San Francisco flight cancelled last minute (at boarding time). The excuse was plane maintenance. This seems to be a common occurance at Spirit according to their customer service. Spirit had very limited options to accommodate us. After two hours in line for customer service. They offered to fly me to cities hundreds of miles away from my destination (not sure how that'd help). Also, they had no options to me to my destination on the same day (remind you it was only 10AM). I had to settle for a refund, and I booked another flight through a major carrier. I understand this is a discount airline, but management has discounted customer value and placed profits over basic customer needs. Overall, this is a poorly run airline in need of a major overhaul.",-1
2017-07-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Detroit,,,,,,1.0,1.0,I am so very disappointed,False,"  Philadelphia to Detroit. I am so very disappointed in Spirit Airlines. Today I woke up to find out my flight was cancelled. If the answer is weather then I would understand, they cancelled my flight due to not having enough staff and that the next flight won't leave until Monday - two days from now! Because of their inability to provide a service, Me and my wife are stuck in Philadelphia having to pay 2 extra days in a hotel we and both will miss two days of work. I can't believe this is happening to us. We called Spirit asking for a full refund and they told us that they couldn't. Now this trip is costing us both more money than we intended to spend.",-1
2017-07-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,horrendous customer service,False,"  Orlando to Newark. My trip was delayed all day due to ""weather concerns"" although all the other airlines were flying in and out of Newark Liberty all day, including one of their own flights to New Jersey. Their agents at the ticket booth and gate were rude and condescending, and had no customer service training. After waiting 13 hours we were boarded only to wait on the plane for 45min before being told the flight was cancelled. Then, there wasn't another flight back to Newark Liberty for two days! I incurred a cost of $300.00 for an overnight stay and $1200.00 for a ticket from Jet Blue flying late afternoon the next day, not to mention away from my own company. Absolutely horrendous customer service and an appalling lack of empathy for their clients.",-1
2017-07-14,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Niagara Falls, NY to Orlando, FL",3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,we had a very normal experience,False,"  Our family flew Spirit round trip from Niagara Falls, NY to Orlando FL. Given the numerous concerns about this airline I had to make some comments. Being our first time using this airline, we had a very normal experience. As with any budget airlines you clearly know going in the cost and just need to be care and plan ahead. Even paying for our baggage both ways, as well as reserving seats so our family could sit together we saved hundreds of dollars. While our flight to Orlando was slightly delayed (we've been delay or had flights cancelled at the last minute with other more popular airlines - which seems to be the norm these days), our return flight home was on time. We received several emails regarding our flight status both ways. While you have to pay for baggage, including typical carry-ons that can be stored overhead, Spirit does allows one small carry on at no cost. Regular size backpacks were no problem. We found the flight attendants pleasant and attentive. They understand the seats are a bit narrow, especially for taller, long legged passengers. When they could, they encouraged people to move into areas of the plane that had more leg room. Given the high cost of air travel this summer, we would have no reservation taking Spirit again. It was well worth the cost.",1
2017-07-14,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Cabo,3.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,attendants were friendly and funny,False," Our Spirit flight from San Diego to Cabo was delayed by over 2 hours. We were told the pilot was held up at another airport. We were not happy and had to wait in the airport for several hours since we had arrived early. However, after finally getting in our flight I was super pleased with how fast they got everyone seated. The flight attendants were friendly and funny. Even better the next day we got an email with a $50 voucher per family member. I would definitely fly Spirit Airlines in the future",1
2017-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled at the last minute,False,"  Houston to Newark. Prior to this experience, I had probably flown with the airline for about 2 or three times in years past. Never had a problem, until last week. My flight was cancelled at the last minute. I couldn't believe it, they said it was the weather. I spent the next 36 hours inside the airport, because I had no money on me to rent a hotel, motel. Spirit Airlines offered no accommodation to those affected by this incompetence. Additionally, the next available flight back home with the airline was to be four days later (5th of July)? I had to pay extra money for the next available and affordable flight with a different and more competent airline. People, pay a little more for convenience, reliability and customer care.",-1
2017-07-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Orlando via Houston,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Avoid this airline,False,  Oakland to Orlando via Houston. Our connecting flight was cancelled. We left at the airport for two days till the next flight. There was nothing offered for this problem other than sorry. We are 1000 miles from our destination! They don't free yo only refund that second part but we still have to find alternatives as they offered nothing. We paid the what others were offering and choose this airline for it depart time. Never again we will fly this airline. Caused a lot of stress and money. Avoid this airline.,-1
2017-07-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Goodbye Spirit,False,"  San Diego to Houston. I cringed when I saw Spirit come up as part of a three flight package deal with Priceline. Spirit, American, and Delta. I have heard of the nightmares. The night before my flight, I read the reviews of so many cancellations so I check my email and boom, my flight was cancelled. I recheduled and went to confirm the flight then hang up. They send me a new email for the flight that was cancelled. They never rebooked the flight. I had to call in again to rebook finally getting it straight. Luckily I got where I needed to be but it wasn't easy. This flight ended up being more expensive than my flight back with another airline after all the added fees. They sent a we are sorry $50 voucher toward another flight which is pointless because I will never fly with them again. I asked why the flight was cancelled. He said it was an issue with the people. Clearly the whole airline. I had two other airlines on this trip going to different destinations. No problems there. Goodbye Spirit. Guess there's always once to know never again.",-1
2017-07-09,0.2,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,missing connection flights,False,"  New Orleans to Orlando. Flight delayed missing connection flights due to a missing flight attendant thats on another flight crazy! Staffing and communication awful! Vacation plans change due to flight. A paid guarantee tickets doesn't mean anything with this airline. Agents are rude and seem confused. Second time riding Spirit Airlines, both times flight delayed. This is a common issue, rating 0.",-1
2017-07-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Detroit, MI to Denver, CO",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,ended up having to drive 18 hours,False,"  Spirit Airlines canceled our flight from Detroit, MI to Denver, CO the night before we were supposed to leave. The only way they notified us was via email which we didn't get until 3am which was an hour before we were meant to leave. It was hard to get ahold of anyone because a phone number was hard to find and the first couple numbers we tried weren't open yet. Once we did get ahold of someone she couldn't understand anything I was saying. Very irritating when you are trying to find a resolution quickly. The only resolution she did find for us was as a flight two days after our original flight was. And they didn't offer to help us find a sooner flight with a different airline. We ended up having to drive 18 hours across the country because our returning flight wasn't with spirit therefore we couldn't get a refund. Every single part of this situation was awful and I will never fly with Spirit again.",-1
2017-07-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Los Angeles,,,,,,1.0,1.0,lady said I am too late,False,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Los Angeles. It's definitely my last time flying with Spirit Airline. I was going at 6:00 am and I came to an airport at 5:10 am so, I was going to check in through a machine but, it just keep saying that it's too late, please see the agents and there was really long lines because others couldn't get their boarding pass on that machine. So, I waited in the line and it was 5:34 am, and the lady said I am too late to go to LAX.I asked for refund my money back but, she said it's not refundable.  And now they said I have to pay more? no more spirit",-1
2017-07-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,customer service horrible,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore. Flight delayed 3 times then they cancel the flight with no announcements. Customer service terrible. Put us on the next flight standby and that flight was oversold so there was no way we would get on flight. Waited 3 hours and people on the next flight offered to give up Their seats and they still put them on the flight even though they made an announcement that they were looking for passengers to give up seats. Again customer service horrible, no communication. Would never fly this airline again.",-1
2017-07-06,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Dallas,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,my experience was excellent,False,"  Minneapolis to Dallas. Despite many terrible reviews, my experience was excellent. We booked one-way tickets more than a week in advance. We brought a small backpack each as our personal bag. It cost 2 adults less than $120 in total to fly from Minneapolis, non-stop, to Dallas. 2 hours and 28 minutes. We left late but arrived on time. Yes, they charge you for water, a ""reserved"" seat, carry-ons (rather pricey if you don't pay in advance), and other things people apparently think they are entitled to. How does one truly think these ""entitlements"" are paid for? These guys are in a for-profit business, just like Delta. Except Delta and the others just bury your entitlements in your (far more costly) ticket price. We got home in under 2.5 hours for less than the price of enough gasoline to drive that same thousand miles. I'm with Spirit every chance I get!",1
2017-07-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Dallas Fort Worth,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I feel I was cheated,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Dallas Fort Worth. My wife bought our tickets online and there were no problems with the flight we had from Dallas Ft Worth to Ft Lauderdale. When we printed the boarding passes for our return flight we noticed that it had no checked bags on the boarding pass, so we called Spirit Airlines to find out what was going on. After waiting on hold for 1/2 hour we talked to someone who had difficulty speaking the English language and they checked on our ticket, and even got a supervisor involved. They assured us that our checked bags were paid for and that there would be no problem at the airport. I asked how the airport would know and I was told that my account would be annotated to explain it and the airport personnel would see that the bags were paid for. I asked if the boarding pass could be updated and was told no - but the staff at the airport would be no problem. I asked if there was anything else that I needed to do and was told there wasn't. Our flight was at 7am so we arrived at the airport at 5am and got in line to check our bags. 45 min later, when it was our turn in front of the Spirit bags counter we were told that no, you have no checked bags paid for so you will have to pay full premium price of $200 for 4 bags. We were given the option of trying to get on the internet and check bags that way (but oh, there is only 20 minutes left and you haven't gone through security yet). So, I paid the $200 ransom just to get us back home. I was told by the Spirit bags person there I could call Spirit and dispute the charges after my return home. I just got off the phone with them. They said they could not offer any compensation but would listen to the phone recording of my call the day before and if I were interested in what they found I could call them back ""in a day or two"" to see what they thought. I feel I was cheated and that this is the way this airline bilks money from their customers and I will never use this airline again, and heartily recommend that others do not either.",-1
2017-07-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,left my 18 year son stranded in Boston,False,"  I can't even begin about the apathy displayed by Spirit Airlines staff. They left my 18 year son stranded in Boston even though he was standing in line to check his bag and refused to take into consideration the length of time it took him to navigate through customs. They checked the bag of the person in front of him in line, announced baggage check was closed, and walked away from the counter. They refused to talk with either him or the other people in line behind my son to offer assistance or explanation. We live in Michigan and to have my son stranded without any help from either the Boston-Logan airport or Spirit Airlines themselves is completely unacceptable. They marked my son as a no-show to the flight and told me I would have to book and pay for another reservation. I encourage everyone to not ever use this airline, next time I fly, I will pay the extra money to ensure a more positive customer service experience.",-1
2017-07-06,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Dallas,3.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,I have no complaints at all,False,"  I'm really surprised with all the bad reviews, I had a really good experience with Spirit Airlines flying from Chicago to Dallas, flights were on time and checking my bags was fast and easy. All personnel were friendly and they definitely make your flight smoother. Airplane was almost new, nice and clean, a lot of people complain about seats being small and not able to recline but hey you're not going to get first class if you're paying the cheapest price. I have no complaints at all.",1
2017-07-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Portland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,they are short sighted and selfish,False,"  Spirit Airlines canceled the flight from Los Angeles to Portland because not enough passengers bought the tickets. They couldn't reroute me because they don't have enough flights. So, I had to buy new round trip tickets for the next day from another airline at the last minute. The cost was much more expensive. They don't compensate the difference. I wasted my money for the round trip taxi fare from home to LAX and had to rebook the hotel at the destination. They refuse to compensate all the extra costs and the fare difference. A few years ago, one of major airlines cancelled my flight, rerouted me for next day flight but they provided one night hotel and food voucher. Avoid this tiny airline, they are short sighted and selfish. I wasted a few hundred $ and several hours of my time at the airport.",-1
2017-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Portland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,The actual flight was terrible,False,  This was the first and last time I will use Spirit Airlines flying from Los Angeles to Portland. Here were the problems with my flight experience: 1) Pre-payment for luggage was not an option for me at the lower price because I purchased my ticket through Expedia. A fact that was not shared with me until it was too late. 2) Simple luggage pricing on the website requires signing up for a 'membership' and sharing personal information. Ridiculous. 3) Pulling up an e-boarding pass on an Android doesn't work. It was a major hassle getting an actual ticket to use at the airport since we didn't want to pay the $10 printing fee the airline states they charge. 4) The actual flight was terrible. 5) The plane had no air conditioning the last part of the flight. 6) The last 20 minutes of the flight was a solid sales pitch for the airline's credit card: One flight attendant on the P.A. system talking while others roamed the aisle pushing applications in our faces. 7) There was no savings compared to Alaska or Delta by the time all the fees were applied.,-1
2017-07-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to New Orleans,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,would never recommend this airline,False, It's definitely last time I am flying with Spirit Airline. Delays again for my flight from Detroit to New Orleans. My last 2 flights with them few years ago were the same. I said I'll give them another chance. It's my birthday and I'm trapped in the airport for a connection flight to my destination. Need better management and learn how to manage time. I would never recommend this airline.,-1
2017-07-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Detroit to Oakland via Houston,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,blatantly refused to do anything,False,"  Where to begin? After checking in to a hotel for the night close to the airport because our Spirit Airlines flight from Detroit to Oakland via Houston was scheduled to leave at 7am. I got an email from Spirit letting me know that the flight was cancelled, 15 minutes later I got another email telling me that I had been booked on a flight leaving more than 12 hours later. When I called customer service, I was told that nothing could be done. They told me that the flight was cancelled because of weather, when they saw themselves caught, they admitted that the flight was cancelled because they did not have a crew. However, the worst part of the situation is that they blatantly refused to do anything for the customer knowing this was their mistake and not mine, trying to just lie openly, accepting it was their fault on record and still not doing anything. The ""Best"" deal that they could do for me was a 100$ credit, not even the hotel I used to stay the night to get to the hotel was worth that. So in conclusion, the airline accepts it is their problem, on record, they recognized I'm the affected one and still the one that ends up in the wrong side of this deal is me. I do agree that they are a ""cheap"" airline, but I did pay 530$ from DTW to OAK with them compared with Delta with the same itinerary for 548$. Should be ashamed on how you treat the customers.",-1
2017-07-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,they offered no compensation,False,"  Flew from New Orleans to Los Angeles. Terrible. I flew alone with my 16 month old, two backpacks and a suitcase. Not one flight attenandant offered help (with getting the luggage through the cramped aisle or storing it overhead). Very unfriendly staff (at the ticket counter and the flight crew). Our return flight was cancelled and they offered no compensation. They told us (at this point it was my husband, son and myself) they could put us on the next flight out which was in two days! We were supposed to fly out on Thursday and the next flight they could get us on was Saturday. All they offered was to refund our money and it would post to our account within 5 to 7 business days. Therefore, we had to pay for a hotel room for the night and new tickets with another airline (which we should have done in the first place). I will never use Spirit Airlines again. I will spend the extra money to fly on a reputable airline.",-1
2017-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,never fly with Spirit Airlines,False,"  Orlando to Boston. I was going for my first domestic trip and since Spirit had cheaper fare, I was lured to buy the tickets. On the day of flight, suddenly before 3hrs, I got mail from Spirit Airlines that flight has been delayed by 3 hrs. Since I was staying far from Orlando Airport, I had already left for the airport. I had no option to reach airport. After half an hour, I got another mail that your flight has been cancelled. They just gave me option to re-book the flight in 7 days. I had to reach Boston that day any how. So I agreed to take flight to Cleveland even tough I had long layover of 4 hours. But the next connecting flight was also delayed. Scheduled departure was 6pm but it came at 10pm. The Spirit Airlines people didn't have courtesy to even talk and the customer care executives told that they cannot do anything. This was not at all professional. There were many people from Orlando who had direct flight but were diverted to Cleveland. There were children, old people waiting for flight and were very hungry. All the restaurants were closed and Spirit Airlines didn't even provide any compensation, this was pathetic service from Spirit Airlines. I would never fly with Spirit Airlines and not even recommend anyone.",-1
2017-06-28,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Oakland,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,"for the price, I'm not going to complain",False,"  We were so pleased with this Spirit flight from Dallas to Oakland. I was hesitant to book with them, because of all of the nasty reviews, however when you're on a budget, you really just have to hope for the best. I will just list the pro's and con's so this review is easier for people to breeze through. Pro's: Super friendly service, even at 05.00 in the morning. Waiting to check-in our luggage was the fastest I've experienced. As long as you have your boarding passes printed out and you are organized, 10 minutes tops for checking in the luggage. The plane was clean. The flight attendants were nice and pretty much just left you alone unless you needed something. 2 free checked bags, 1 free carry on for DOD and Service members! Con's: The seats on the airplane do not recline. The seats were not overly comfortable and you do have minimum space, but for the price, I'm not going to complain. You have to pay if you want to sit together. But 8-10 bucks per person still didn't have the total come even close to other airlines tickets. They only fly out of certain airports. For us, that adds on a 2.5 hour drive, but again 1/4 tank of gas one way and visiting a friend is not really a con. Would we rather drive 1 hour to the Austin Airport, sure, but them I'm paying at least 150.00 more per ticket. We will continue to use Spirit as long as there is a airport they travel too!",1
2017-06-28,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlantic City to Tampa,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,smoothest flight ever,False,  Atlantic City to Tampa. Myself and my children just had the smoothest flight ever. Flight 341 from Atlantic City to Tampa was amazing. The leg room on our plane wasn't an issue this time and the flight crew give a free flight away to a passenger in row 21. Thank you for the wonderful flight.,1
2017-06-27,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Ft Lauderdale via Punta Cana,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I would use them again,False,  We were very nervous to have had to fly Spirit Airlines with the reviews being what they were but to our delight we had a great trip flying from Orlando to Ft Lauderdale via Punta Cana! The planes we had were clean and on time and their attendants were super friendly. I did see some people give the gate lady a hard time because the flight was sold out and they had been on standby but to my knowledge no one was booted off. We did have to pay for snacks and drinks but whatever flying is expensive and I can accept paying 20$ for some popcorn and drinks. You ever go to a movie theater? Same thing. Needless to say we had a great time and Spirit got us to and from safely and happily. I would use them again. Their on board attendants were hilarious. The only thing I would change is maybe having more snacks to choose from.,1
2017-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1.0,we're done with Spirit,False,"  Las Vegas to Chicago O'Hare. They will probably be the cheapest for a bare bones ticket. Just don't add things like a carry on, choosing your seat, or possibly oxygen to breathe (ok, a little facetious on that last one). Our problem was in chicago, wanting to come back to Vegas. No issues until a couple of hours before we are scheduled to fly, and then the email the flight is cancelled. So the entire group of customers walks back to the service desks to see what can be done. My wife calls the service number where a barely English speaking rep tells her the flight was cancelled due to weather. You know, since every other plane is both leaving chicago and vegas. She wouldn't accept any other information, even when the staff at the desk tells us the Captain just didn't show up to work. And apparently they've had this problem several times recently. So what was their customer service, or lack of in this case, trying to pass off. Thankfully, the desk staff were very helpful, got us scheduled on an United flight the next afternoon, set us up on a local hotel, and gave us several food vouchers. That was the good out of all of this. The desk staff were awesome! Everything else was horrible. If this was just an isolated incident, so be it, things happen. But when we were told multiple stories of this happening from first person points of view, well, we're done with Spirit.",-1
2017-06-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas city to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,ever fly on Spirit Airline again,False,"  Kansas city to Ft Lauderdale. This airline does not even deserve 1 star, unfortunately that is the lowest rating available. I will never fly on Spirit Airline again! When we first booked the tickets we thought we were getting a good deal on the price. Spirit Airlines nickel and dimed us for everything from the seats to the luggage. We had 2 of the smallest checked bags (which were the same price as the carry on) and the cheapest seats. We had one lay over there, and one on the way back. We had to pay for seats each time. By the time we paid for the bare minimums the trip cost us as much as it would if we had gone through a good airline such as American or Southwest. We needed to change flights more than 4 days in advance. Spirit tried to charge us almost $600 more! Yet the flight time, duration, and miles are the exact same for the day before and the scheduled day! The airplanes were dirty, outdated and uncomfortable. Customer service is rude. They would not stop interrupting me and made it very clear they did not care.",-1
2017-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Minneapolis via Los Angeles,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,be very careful if you take Spirit,False," My daughter qualified to compete in the 2017 NCAA track & field championship in Eugene, Oregon. As such, I purchased 8 round-trip tickets for family and friends on Spirit Airlines from Minneapolis to Portland. The outbound flight, with connection in Chicago, was fine. The return flight from Portland to Minneapolis (through LAX) on June 11 was a disaster for the 15 Minneapolis-bound passengers. The flight from Portland to LA was scheduled to leave at 3:15 p.m. but was finally pushed back to 4:08 p.m., scheduled to arrive in LAX at 6:27 p.m. The avowed reason for the plane’s delay arriving in Portland was “air traffic control” reasons. Our connection to Minneapolis was scheduled to depart from LAX at 6:29 p.m. so, not surprisingly, the 15 Twin Cities’ bound passengers were a bit nervous about meeting their connection in LA, and actively seeking alternative flights from Portland to Minneapolis. Prior to getting on the plane, the lead Spirit agent on the desk in Portland guaranteed the Twin Cities’ passengers that they would be able to meet their connection in LA to travel to the Twin Cities. Moreover, he assured the Twin Cities’ passengers that even if we did not make our connection in LA, that Spirit would get us back to the Twin Cities that night on another airline. He also said (correctly) that the connection in LA would be easy because the arrival gate was literally right next to the departure gate for the Twin Cities. With those assurances, all 15 Twin passengers boarded the Spirit Airlines flight from Portland to LA confident they would get back to the Twin Cities that night. We touched down at LAX around 6:15-6:20 p.m. and the plane scurried to the gate. When we exited the plane and took the 15-20 steps to the adjacent departure gate for the Twin Cities’ bound flight, we were shocked to see that the plane had just left the gate. We could literally see the plane 100 feet from the window. The Spirit supervisor in LA said that Spirit would not authorize putting us on a flight on another airline to the Twin Cities. The remedies suggested by the Spirit staff to remedy were laughable, for example, they could put us on a red-eye to Baltimore or Philadelphia, and then fly to the Twin Cities, getting us back the next afternoon at 2:00 p.m. The default seemed to be that everybody would simply remain in LA until the next day and board Monday’s 6:29 p.m. non-stop flight from LA to Twin Cities. The LA supervisor further said that the airline would not be responsible for hotels and other costs, as the flight delay was not due to a mechanical failure, but rather to air traffic control issues. As to the reason for the Spirit plane leaving us behind, the answers provided by the Spirit staff on-duty were pretty vague, but finally one of the staff said that one of the most important reasons was to allow Spirit customers on the flight to the Twin Cities the opportunity to meet their connections in the Twin Cities. The plane arrived in the Twin Cities at around 11:30 p.m. – connections at that time of night, really? Frankly, I doubt that any passenger on that plane had a close connection in the Twin Cities at that time of night, and for sure not on a Spirit plane. Spirit planes, flight crew, and cabin crew seem okay for a budget airline. However, I would say that the Spirit operations folks and gate supervisors are really at the bottom of the barrel. Be very careful if you take Spirit Airlines, and particularly if you have a connection.",-1
2017-06-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Dallas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,hope you guys go out of business.,False,"  Boston to Dallas. We are the grandparents of a 15 yr old who was going to a wedding in New Hampshire, and this was his first time flying. Flying to Boston was fine, but then coming back was horrible for him because his flight was canceled - this is a 15 yr old flying by himself than having to stay by himself at a hotel. Spirit Airlines, I really don't know how you stay in business doing this. I really hope that you guys go out of business. We will not fly with you.",-1
2017-06-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Phoenix,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,won't go to any effort to get me home,False," I made reservations a month in advance on this ""cheap"" airline. The reservation booked was from Philadelphia to Phoenix, with 1 layover in Ft. Lauderdale. Couldn't check in online without paying for a premium seat for each flight. Went to the Spirit counter and was handed 3 tickets, and told I was actually going Philadelphia to Ft. Lauderdale to Dallas/Ft. Worth and then to Phoenix. When I argued that's not what I booked, I was told ""well, all the flights don't always show."" I was also shocked to be told I had to pay $59 for a carry-on. Where was that fine print? So I proceed to wait at gate A14, when suddenly people start to leave that gate. I asked a departing gentleman why, and he said an employee had just quietly told him and his friends that the flight was changed to gate A4. No announcement, nothing on the departures monitors indicated a change, but I went to A4 to ask if this was the flight. It was. We then proceeded to stand in line for an hour waiting to board. We boarded, taxied a minute, but the captain said we had to return for a mechanical issue. Next announcement was that the gate we left from was occupied and we had to wait for another gate. Got to another gate and were told 20 minutes, which was actually more than an hour. Not allowed to get off plane, no drinks served, etc. Flight to Lauderdale ultimately 3 hours late, and I missed my connecting flight. This was on a Thursday evening. Spirit told me they couldn't get me out until Saturday afternoon. No, they won't put me up for 2 nights; no they won't get me on another airline; no they won't go to any effort to get me home (they already had my money). I'm a lawyer and had to be back for court on Friday, so waiting until Saturday not an option. I had to pay $670 to another airline to get home. Cheap flight? I think not. I could've flown 1st class for what I ended up spending. Now I'm still arguing with them about a refund. I was told I'd get a call within 48 hours. After 7 days I called them, and was put on hold repeatedly. I will never ever fly Spirit again.",-1
2017-06-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Not once did we receive any information,False,"  We booked tickets months in advance for a large international conference that our business was exhibiting at. The flight from Baltimore to New Orleans was initially delayed 4 hours, then was back on schedule, was delayed, delayed even more, and delayed again. Not once did we receive any information and Spirit staff never announced anything at the airport. Spirit staff gave us multiple reasons why the flight was delayed and said that a plane was on the way for us. They said weather, then air traffic control, then weather again, and then no reason for the cancellation. There were no supervisors present for anyone to talk with, even after asking for a supervisor multiple times. No options to fly out the next day, no options to fly with another airline, and no reimbursement for the hotel. They offered a $50 future flight voucher. We were told that we weren't able to get a refund until the flight was cancelled. What a collassal waste of time. Would never recommend this airline to anyone.",-1
2017-06-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montego Bay to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,first and last time flying with Spirit,False,  Don't fly Spirit Airlines. This will be my first and last time flying with Spirit. They canceled our flight from Jamaica to Ft Lauderdale and left everyone on that flight from Jamaica without any early notice or options on getting another flight back into the US. People was left scattering with no hotel nor other flights remaining. Spirit told us that last flight (which was canceled) was the only one until possibly two days later.,-1
2017-06-21,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to New York City,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Do not fall victim to Spirit,False,"  I just recently flew on Spirit for the first time from FLL to LGA for a weekend trip to New York City. Prior to my flight, I had read some pretty nightmare-ish reviews on this airline and was not going in with any expectations whatsoever. Unsurprisingly, my entire experience with Spirit was not a very pleasant one and was in line with other people's negative reviews of their Spirit trips. Firstly, the low ticket prices, while alluring on the surface, are a complete hoax as Spirit nickels and dimes you for every little part of your trip beyond the cheap ticket price. To start, in the year 2017 there is no option for a mobile ticket. You either have to print the ticket at home or once you get to the airport at check in for an extra $10 or so. Believe me, you will want to choose your seat previous to arriving at the airport or else you have to stand by the check in desk at the gate and wait for a miserable/unhelpful attendant to shout out your name for your seating assignment, basically an almost inevitable middle seat towards the back of the plane. So with that factoring in, you are already adding another $30 or so to your ticket price. You get charged ridiculous fees for checked or carry on bags at the airport so make sure to pay for those in advance through the website (try at all costs to avoid having to call the customer service line unless you want to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to speak to yet another miserable Spirit employee whose anything but eager to help you solve your issue). Yes, you have to pay for any carry on greater than the size of a small backpack. Also keep in mind the maximum weight for checked bags is a mere 40 pounds, compared to the industry standard 50 with every other airline, ridiculous I know. The flight, after being delayed 3 hours for ""weather"" despite the forecasts for both Florida and New York being beautiful and clear, was not terrible. The seat was not the most comfortable but it was not the most uncomfortable either. There were no outlets or entertainment screens, again expecting the worse I was not surprised with this. The flight attendant crew was friendly and accommodating but again you have to pay for everything on board, including $3 for a glass of water. Much better off bringing your own snacks on board. Needless to say, I booked my return flight home with another airline for the same price as it ended up costing me for my flight with Spirit but with outlets, entertainment screens, on board snacks included and no ridiculous seat, bag, or ticket fees. Do not fall victim to Spirit's falsely ""bargain"" flights unless you want to arrive late with a mountain of frustration and a dead phone.",-1
2017-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Tampa via Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,will never fly Spirit again,False," Will never fly Spirit again. My returning flight from Minneapolis to Tampa via Atlanta was cancelled and rescheduled twice resulting in two days of lost wages at work. There was no reason given for the first cancellation. The second cancellation happened due to weather. We were all boarded on the plane and then returned to the gate. Minutes after we returned to the gate, the flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. Other flights around us from other airlines waited until the storm passed and got their customers out that same night. Spirit offered a ""discount rate"" to stay in a hotel and made it clear that the cost was our responsibility. Most of us slept at the airport as the discount was not really a discount especially considering the extra cost of a taxi or uber. Spirit has so many hidden fees that they don't disclose upfront until you buy the ticket. Then you find out that a carry-on plus a small personal item will cost $45 each way if you pay prior to arriving at the airport. If you wait until you get to the airport, the price increases to $65 each way. I witnessed so many angry customers. Thankfully I paid my fee online but the customers who didn't complained and I heard the agent tell them that they should have read the fine print and that was their responsibility. One man asked to speak to a supervisor and was told ""the supervisor is busy"". The staff were rude and appeared to be uncaring about their frustrated customers. In addition, there were several delays. I lost count of how many emails I received saying that our flight was delayed another hour. This is not truly a discounted airline in my opinion. What they discount in ticket sales, they gain by charging customers ridiculously high fees for everything. I believe I would have been better off flying with any other airline. I will be sure to tell my story to everyone I know and every chance I get when someone is thinking of booking a flight. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through with Spirit Airlines.",-1

Their baggage size limits for personal items have changed, forcing you to pay for a bag. Nothing is easy on their website. I spent 2 hours trying to check in and pay for bags only to have the boarding passes print saying 0 bags. Now I have to call their customer service. This is not worth it.",-1

Due to fly from Minneapolis to Dallas Fort Worth. I was notified about the flight cancellation at my gate and I had to cancel my hotel booking, car rental and everything else. I walked to the ticket center but they were not ready to provide any compensation for my loss. My one month planning was all ruined because of 1 flight cancellation. I had to pay extra for a taxi while rebooking my flight and the customer service was very poor, infact they were rude.",-1
2017-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to San Diego via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Absolute worst airline,False,"  Atlanta to San Diego via Chicago. Absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I have flown Spirit Airlines before and had seen others flights get cancelled (on my trip from aan diego to Atlanta) but this time it happened to me (from Atlanta to San Diego). It was not before bad weather, aircraft problems, or other safety concerns; it was for a shortage of personnel.  Letting some one know just hours before their flight is an unacceptable way to do business. Not to mention hat Spirit has no relation with other carriers and does not attempt to rebook you . I don't care if the flight was inexpensive if it gets cancelled and now I have to purchase a last minute flight at triple the original prices since it is the day of. Oh, and not to mention that the online help service ""professionals"" that i spoke with could barely speak English and told me that they could refund my flight but I would still have a connecting flight to my destination. Come to find out, the lady cancelled the whole thing so I was left without out a flight in Chicago after I had purchased a flight through another airline to Chicago for my supposed connection. Needless to say, after the horrible customer service, cancelled flights, pathetic travel voucher, I will never again be traveling spirit. As a college student it is nice to have an inexpensive trip once in a while but with a $250 trip turns into a $500 trip overnight, it's hard to justify the trip. Do not travel with Spirit Airlines. It is not worth saving $50 or $100 to end up stranded last minute with no help to find a connection.",-1

I called Spirit, there was no explanation as to the cause. When I contacted customer service they were rude with poor service and no solutions or ways to fix the problem. The flight was canceled due to traffic conditions and they could not put me on another flight. Every other airline that I checked with was able to fly their flights to Orlando with no delay. I got the flight rescheduled for the next day. Very disappointed. Throughout my trip I learnt from several other people how unhappy they were with Spirit! This was my last time with this airline.",-1
2017-06-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Costa Rica to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,don't do anything for their customers,False,"  We were set to fly out at 12.30 but when we arrived at the airport they said the flight was delayed 3hrs, originally we were supposed to get to Baltimore at 10.30 pm, but when they issued our tickets they put our connecting flight leaving at 8.00 am the next day. When we arrived in Fort Lauderdale at 9.00pm we went to the ticketing counter and waited 2 hours in line just to find out they couldn't get us on a earlier flight. They don't do anything for their customers, no food vouchers, no hotel, no cup of coffee , nothing . Everyone one we talked to just had that attitude that they just don't give a damn, I will never fly Spirit Airlines again or recommend it.",-1
2017-06-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,waited 45 mins to just talk to an agent,False,"  Spirit Airlines decided to let me know 2 hours before my flight from Orlando to Atlanta that my flight was cancelled, then within thirty mins told me that it was just a delay. I arrive at the airport to find out the flight is still cancelled yet I never got another email letting me know this. I call customer service just to make sure, waited 45 mins to just talk to an agent and from there she tells me it's due to the weather. The lady basically tells me there is nothing she can do but refund me, at this point I'm extremely upset as ad plans and reservations. I call again thirty mins later to make sure my refund goes through and I ask again why they cancelled a flight with no bad weather and now their excuse was that they had no crew members to fly the plane. This is the worst company to fly with.",-1
2017-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Dallas Fort Worth,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,will never ever fly Spirit again,False,"  Will never fly with Spirit Airlines again. Flew from Las Vegas to Dallas Fort Worth. Bought our tickets and then found out we had to pay another fee to get seats. Got on the plane and the captain said it would be a little while before take off because we were waiting for a connecting flight with some passengers that needed on our plane. Finally they show up and its Spirit employees. So our day was delayed because of Spirit employees. Shouldn't customers come first? Now on the plane and they charge for water. Horrible. The weight on bags is 40 unlike the other airlines they are 50. So of course you have to pay $30 more on top of the $42 already paid for my bag. Landed went to baggage claim, took them 1 hour for the flights luggage to come on the carousel. I had to pay another $24 for parking at the airport because I should have been at my car by 5 to not pay a extra day. Had plenty of time to be there to get if it wasn't for waiting a hour to get our luggage. We fly quite often but will never ever fly Spirit again.",-1
2017-06-18,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,4.0,,1.0,,,4.0,4.0,pleasantly surprised as to how easy it was,False,"  I was expecting the worst possible case scenario when going from Seattle Los Angeles while flying with Spirit Airlines for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised as to how easy it was. Yes you don’t get a free drink or peanuts but who really needs that anyways when you can bring on your own snacks. You have to calculate how much the extras will charge you when booking a flight with Spirit vs what another airline. The cost of the flight itself, the cost of a checked in bag vs carry on, print off your own boarding pass so it does not cost you an additional charge, plan on grabbing a drink and a snack prior to boarding so you don’t pay the cost for a drink or snacks on the flight because they are not free and you will be fine. I will be flying with them again knowing how rude the customer service will be.",1
2017-06-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,very poorly run airline,False,"  A previous email was titled you get what you pay for, I agree. Our early morning flight from Dallas to Boston was cancelled which we found out about it at the gate. We were told to go back out to the check in desk. A real airline would have been able to book us on another flight. At check in total chaos. 1 person trying to handle all passengers! Given the option to get a refund or call a number on a preprinted card - red flag! Calling the number did nothing - they could get us on a flight the next day. No good since the ship was leaving 3 hours after we would land. Since Spirit doesn't have partnerships with other airlines we were out of luck. We spent the next 3 hours trying to get on another flight. No luck so now instead of being on a cruise ship, I'm home writing this review of a very poorly run airline.",-1

Sould have researched and found reviews before hand. Flew down from Newark NJ to Fort Lauderdale on my favorite airline, jetBlue. Fare was $64.00 all in. Booked my return through Spirit Airlines $74 booked late so understood! Get to airport with my small normal carry on I use for all my flights, was charged $59. Never in my life have I ever been charged for carry on. Charged for non alcoholic beverages and snack. Not a cup of tap water even or a small snack nuts, chips, etc. No TV, seats are like metal prison chairs, don't recline, tray size of a kindle. Had the nerve to announce to help clean up to keep fares cheap. Will never under any circumstances use Spirt airlines again. I rather pay $20 to $50 extra on any other airline.",-1

Flight was delayed in Montego Bay then the flight in Fort Lauderdale that we were supposed to catch going to Atlanta was cancelled which they had already moved us to another flight because of the delay from Montego Bay so we ended up in that nasty airport in FLL for 12hrs to catch a flight to Atlanta. I will never fly with Spirit again. I would rather pay the money and go straight to my destination like we always do.",-1
2017-06-16,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Fort Lauderdale via Orlando,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I'd highly recommend Spirit,False," I recently flew Spirit airlines and given all of the reviews I read prior to my experience, I felt compelled to share my feedback. Firstly, I chose Spirit because I was looking for an economy airline. I went into the experience with eyes wide-open. I knew that Spirit's business model was ""a la carte"" so to speak - baggage, seat selection, priority boarding, boarding pass printing, in-flight snack at an additional cost above the base price. Spirit did not disappoint. My family had a wonderful experience. I started my trip from CLE (Cleveland) to MCO (Orlando). Although my flight was late departing, Spirit kept us informed, unlike many airlines. From MCO, my husband and I flew to FLL (Ft. Lauderdale). The most impressive part of that trip was that Spirit was facing delays due to crew scheduling, however they mitigated the issue by using the same flight attendants from the inbound flight instead of waiting for the originally scheduled flight attendants to arrive. How many airlines do you know that would do that to keep a flight on time? Exemplary service! Then, on our flight back home the handle on my daughter's rolling backpack was broken. She took it into the office at baggage claim and immediately, no questions asked, they offered her a bag replacement and mileage for the hassle. Again, how many airlines do you know who even cover bag damage when it's a handle, wheel or even a tear. For all those Spirit nay-sayers, stop complaining about the ""a la carte"" fees. The airline is founded on those principles. If you want everything included, use one of the high priced airlines. You won't get better service and you'll pay more. If that's your goal, then go for it. If you want an airline who's focused on providing stellar service for an economical price, I'd highly recommend Spirit.",1
2017-06-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,you get what you pay for but lesson learned,False,"  I have flown all over the country and have never had as many issues with one single flight as I did with Spirit. I got an email 3 hours before my flight that it had been cancelled. However, there was no explanation as to the cause. When two other guests tried to call and work out the issue they were confronted with poor service and no solutions or ways to fix the flight. After that, I called Spirit and would not take no for an answer and finally asked that if the flight was canceled due to weather conditions that they put me on another flight. Every other airline that I checked with was able to fly their flight to Orlando with no delay. I don't know why Spirits planes could not fly in the weather. I had a flight for Wednesday as a direct flight and they said the earliest they could book me was for Friday night. Finally, I got the flight rescheduled to Thursday at 8.30 am but at 3.30 am got an email getting saying the flight was going to be delayed anywhere from 7-50 minutes. So they suggested we be at the airport at regular time. When I got there to check in there was no one at the desk and I waited 20 minutes before I spoke to anyone for them to tell me there was a delay until 10.00 so now I have to wait another 3 hours. I know you get what you pay for but lesson learned. Very disappointed. On the way and throughout my trip I learned from several other people how unhappy they were with Spirit!",-1

This was the second flight I've booked and the second time the flight from LaGuardia to Tampa has been cancelled, this time when I arrived at the airport.

Had to spend over $200 for new tickets with a different airline so I don't sleep two nights in Detroit. Utterly disappointed, I'll never book with a them again. I rather pay more and have peace of mind than to be left almost stranded like this. Apparently they cancelled because of ""bad weather"" but it's bogus, just an excuse. Weather conditions for our plane were dandy. Even staff couldn't explain what kind of ""bad weather"" it was. They left women with children and babies hanging. No helpful accommodations like free hotel stay etc. Never again.",-1

They flew a whole plane from Florida to Costa Rica and forgot to load the luggage leaving 86 bags in Florida. Over 2 hours to get through the Spirit Baggage claim line. Luggage arrived 36 hours later. We paid $84 to check our bag and had to spend $100+ on stuff when we landed because our bag was still in Florida. The Spirit customer service was rude and unprofessional, the refused to accommodate us in any way or refund out checked bag fee (least they could do!). Stay away from this airline at all costs. Our lost luggage was only half of it we had issues checking in and after 3 phone calls, 5 different reasoning and a couple hours of wasted time someone finally realize they didn't have our passport numbers.",-1
2017-06-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Thomas to Los Angeles via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,do not include the basic services,False," Very disappointed. Airline search engines, such as kayak, should be clear that Spirits bogus cheap flights do not include the basic services included in other airlines. Bringing one bag and sitting at a window seat added $120 to my ticket from St Thomas to Los Angeles via Ft Lauderdale. Very uncomfortable. It felt like we were stacked in like sardines. I'm 5'5 and 125lbs and felt very smushed. Of course you can pay extra for extra leg room that they give you already on other airlines. And the seats do not recline! Very uncomfortable on my 5 hour red eye flight that ended with a painful knot in my back. I had to take time out on my visit with my family to get a masseuse to work out. After 5 hour red eye return flight landing at 5am my connecting flight that was supposed to be a 7 hour layover is now delayed to a 10 hour layover.",-1
2017-06-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Seattle,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,don't bother with Spirit Airlines,False,"  If you have time sensitive travel plans then don't bother with Spirit Airlines. We were 2 and half hours late arriving and are currently 30 minutes behind with no plane in sight flying from Los Angeles to Seattle. If you want cheap flights where you are always late, pay for bags, pay for beverages, even water, then Spirit is for you.",-1
2017-06-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Seattle,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the most incompetent airline,False,"  My family flew with Spirit for the first (and last) time today. Here is our experience. I tried to pay to check in bags 2 days before my trip, but the website kept failing to process my payment. I tried again the next day and it seemed to work. When I showed up to the airport the next day, they told me that I had not paid and charged me a higher rate than the website rate. I told them their website was broken and that they knew it. They did not respond to my claim. All 4 of our boarding passes were marked pre-TSA. According to the TSA officer, 2 of our passes were not actually pre-TSA despite what the boarding pass said. My wife and daughter had to leave and go to another security line. Flight was delayed. Flight was oversold. My family has flown all over America and to many countries around the world. When it comes to air travel, we've seen it all. But this airline is the most incompetent airline we've ever flown. Sorry, I don't have a PDF copy of the boarding pass, but I was able to get a PDF copy of the receipt and have attached it. Perhaps when I return home from vacation I can find a scanner and scan the copy of the boarding pass I have.",-1
2017-06-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SJU to LAX via FLL,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,should have checked the reviews,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. You end up paying more or less what you would for a ticket from an airline that offers better service, comfort and options. I should have checked the reviews beforehand. I chose this airline on my flight back to LA because of the departure time and to avoid MIA airport, where I experience at least a 2 hour delay consistently. Purchased $18 seats that do not even recline. The airline doesn't even offer water for free ($3) in flights. They advertised one free luggage, and I ended up paying for both ($110) + $30 for weight exceeding 40 lbs. the standard is 50 lbs. Total unexpected cost = $90. I guess it is hard to quantify the cost of the following, but worth mentioning: no wifi, no movies, no reclining seat, very uncomfortable and hard seats, all food sold is junk food. I should have paid those extra $90-$110 for a better airline. A cheap discount airline that sell themselves as something else.",-1
2017-06-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Spirit is unreliable,False," Our Spirit Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston was cancelled after the front desk said it would be a 3 hour delay. Other, better airlines were continuing operation, as normal. The reason Spirit cancelled was construction at Logan, which they somehow construed as ""unanticipated"". Unbelievable! After waiting an hour in line to talk with a representative, I was told that our options were either to fly out on a Spirit flight 2 days later without compensation for hotel, food or transportation or refund as I needed to be in Boston the next day, so I had to pay $500 to get on another flight with a different airline. All because Spirit is unreliable, and ultimately a death sentence for people hoping to simply get from one place to another. Avoid at all costs. I will never fly with Spirit again. Ever.",-1
2017-06-12,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Atlantic City,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,4.0,attendant was outgoing and funny,False," We fly Spirit because of the low rates and also because it is a very convenient location for us. Overall I'd say we are pretty unhappy that the adage ""You get what you pay for"" at Spirit is true overall. However, this review is positive for flight NK227 (Boston to Atlantic City) - one of the flight attendants, was outgoing and funny during the flight, making the majority of the passengers laugh. There is a lot to work on at Spirit but having more staff like this would make the flights more enjoyable.",-1
2017-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I was up charged near $100,False,"  Flew from Orlando to Boston. Charged me and my wife $120 at the gate to put 2 duffel bags overhead that could have easily fit under the seat. This was even after a gentlemen working for the airline helped us print our tickets and mentioned nothing. Going back and carefully reviewing a long list of baggage rules it seems they do charge to carry on a bag, which shouldn't even really be a thing right? After paying the $120 I was told if I did it online when I bought my ticket then it would have only been $20 a bag. Because I was unaware and moved forward without paying to bring on a bag, I was up charged near $100. For what? Another hidden service fee? $100 because the guy at the ticket counter allowed me to pass without asking or suggesting. What if I didn't have a credit card on me to pay? Then what? I don't fly. Unreal. Never flying Spirit again.",-1
2017-06-10,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Cabos to San Diego,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,staff were very friendly and helpful,False,"  My family and I had a great experience with Spirit flying from Los Cabos to San Diego, we followed all instructions which were sent in emails prior to our flight. I pre purchased our checked bag fees, pre printed our boarding passes, arrived early to the airport. Everything was wonderful! The staff were very friendly and helpful, the plane were nice and comfortable. So we had to purchase our beverages, no big deal, it was a short flight. Thank you for the inexpensive and great experience!",1
2017-06-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,lack of reasonable customer service representatives,False,"  Everyone knows that Spirit Airlines flights are uncomfortable. However, my biggest problem with Spirit is the horrible lack of reasonable customer service representatives. 99% of the Customer Service staff I've had the misfortune of working with have all been horribly impatient and are never truly concerned with keeping their customer satisfied. First, one of my flights was cancelled on me. When this happened, the first customer service representative I spoke told me that Spirit wouldn't be providing me accommodation for the night, even though the next available flight wasn't until the following night. I spent hours in the airport, thinking I was doomed to spend the night there. The issue did eventually get resolved, resulting in me being issued a travel voucher for $100. A few weeks later, when I went to use this travel voucher, it failed to work. As it turns out, the voucher was issued incorrectly. By the time this issue got brought to light with customer service representatives, the price of the flight I was trying to book had increased by over $100. Not only that, the only way for me to use the voucher now was on the phone, where it could be fixed manually, meaning I'd incur a $25 fee for using the phone reservation booking system. The representative failed to see my frustration, simply saying that flight prices change all the time. Yes, this is true. However, at the time I wanted to book my flight, it was significantly cheaper, and the only reason I wasn't able to was because of a mistake made by Spirit staff.",-1
2017-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montego Bay to Chicago via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,or wait 7 days refund,False,  Montego Bay to Chicago via Fort Lauderdale. Plane was 3 hrs late in MBJ no reason given. We landed in Fort Lauderdale were forced to sit on tarmac for two hours in plane with screaming baby. Missed connection to Chicago. Spirit said sorry you can fly home tomorrow at 6:30 pm or wait 7 days refund!,-1
2017-06-06,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,2.0,food is very expensive,False," First I tried to check in online for my Spirit Airlines flight from Houston to Newark and it would not allow me to do so. If you do not sign up you cannot make your check in, they should have a guest check in. At the kiosk doing the check in, the charges for carry-on is outrageous $59.00 for a bag they don't touch at all. The price is of the ticket is good but they catch you when you have a carry-on. Food is also very expensive. I will not use Spirit Airline again.",-1
2017-06-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Dallas,1.0,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,so many hidden fees ,False,"  Denver to Dallas. I will never use Spirit again, it didn't end up being any cheaper than using American or any of the other and far less convenient! They charge for carry on bags which most airlines don't do and their weight limit for a check bag is 40lbs instead of 50 so you pay a lot extra unless you know in advance! Not to mention waiting an hour for my bags after getting off the plane. You also have to pay to chose your seat even if its economy - so many hidden fees it's ridiculous! Never again will I use a budget airline!",-1
2017-06-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,ticket price not worth it,False," Chicago to Las Vegas. The cost of the Spirit Airlines ticket was cheap but it's not worth it at all. I paid for my bag online and when I got to the check in desk it was 52 pounds so I had to pay $55 extra. $90 for a 52 pound bag. They are the only airline I've ever been on that makes you pay $3 for water or soda. They don't hand out any snacks (crackers, pretzels) plus its card only. I had to pay $5 to get a card so I could pay the $55 for my luggage. Plus they charge you for carry on. No WiFi, or TV. It just is uncomfortable and one of the attendants was kind of rude about me not putting my bag under the seat and waiting behind the line I guess I was supposed to wait behind for the bathroom. Plain and simple first and last time riding Spirit. The ticket is cheap but paying for everything else makes the ticket price not even worth it. Would definitely rather ride Southwest, any day. Never again",-1
2017-06-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,lack of organization and care,False,"  This was the most unprofessional airline I have ever flown. They cancelled my morning flight (flight 404 at 9am getting into ATL at 10.45) when I was mid transport to the airport. When I called Spirit, their automated system stated that the current wait time was over an hour and placed me on hold with no option to leave a callback number or further information as to why my flight was cancelled. Luckily, I had booked the flight through orbitz and called them on a separate phone. They stated that they had not even been notified of the flight cancellation by Spirit and promptly placed me on the next available flight (which wasn't until 6.45 pm). This flight landed at 8.28 pm at which point they let us know that there were no available gates and we would be waiting on the tarmac for 10-15 minutes. After 30 minutes without air conditioning, they finally turned the air on and came back on to say it would be another 15 minutes. We waited on the tarmac a total of 55 minutes because of their lack of organization and care for customers. I have to pay extra for parking since the cancellation and tarmac delay pushed me into another day worth of parking. No complementary drinks were offered as we all sat in the humid heat of the plane and the overall care for passengers and their time was not considered. I will never fly this airline again and urge you not to either. It is unpredictable, unprofessional, and not worth the cheaper price tag.",-1
2017-06-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit would not reimburse me,False,"  We had an 8:00 am flight that we learned was cancelled when we arrived at the airport at 6:00 am. We were put on another airline which ended up to be great but when we got there, we were charged again for our baggage! Spirit would not reimburse me after asking and explaining my situation. Also if my flight costs $190 and they charge for my bags and my seat and then cancel my flight shouldn't I get the cost of my seat and bags back being they weren't used? I get that the $190 went to the new flight but Spirit says you only pay for what you want which is seats together with my family, which I didn't get and my bags paid for which I had to pay twice!!  I've flown Spirit before even after reading horrible reviews but no more! They are not cheap. They just break down the price.",-1
2017-06-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to La Guardia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,do not fly this airline,False,"  Myrtle Beach to La Guardia. The worst airline ever. Charged me $65.00 for a carry on bag, even though the dimensions coincided with their regulations. They told the woman in front of me her bag was too big and she had to pay, but they would give her the downstairs fair at $30.00. I wondered why I couldn't get the downstairs fair, yet complaining to them did nothing. They didn't care and I was charged the full amount, my bag even smaller than hers. They did not offer any complimentary beverages, not even water. My family and I paid for extra leg room and it was an absolute joke, my dad's knees touching the seat in front of him. Beware and do not fly this airline.",-1
2017-06-03,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to New Orleans,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,2.0,Spirit has now lost a loyal customer,False,"  On Friday May 26th 2017, I traveled from New Orleans to Houston (IAH) with my two sons via Spirit Airlines. This flight (flight # 657) was excellent to say the least. The staff were exceptional at the New Orleans airport and mad the trip a smooth one. Also, the pilot was excellent on takeoff and landing. I have to give credit where credit is due. Unfortunately, upon departure from Houston IAH on May 28th, 2017 we encountered major problems with the airline and staff. First, my family and I checked in 24-hrs before the flight and received confirmation and were set to leave the following day at 6.19pm (5.34pm last call for boarding). Since we were travelling from Wharton, Texas to the airport we left early to avoid traffic and to get situated in the airport early. When we arrived at the airport, we checked in our rental car and proceeded to print our boarding passes and get through TSA. This is when we learned, via the Kiosk, that our flight had been cancelled. I checked my email for any email correspondence and I saw that Spirit sent out email correspondence at 12.52 pm, after hotel check out time and approximately 4hrs and 26min before final boarding call! This is unacceptable. Secondly, when waiting in line to be rebooked, there was one lane open to rebook the entire flight. The staff member responsible for rebooking was incredibly slow, spending at least 1hr and 30 min on the group in front of me and at least 2hrs and 30 minutes on me (may I add she was unable to rebook us due to her clerical errors). Once she got to me she was heavily distracted by other customers in other lanes and assisting the Spirit employees with their customers all while working with me. This resulted in her typing my name incorrectly while rebooking my group with a Delta flight because a customer who had been given an illegible boarding pass interrupted us and she fixed his problem so he could catch his soon leaving flight, causing her to have to re-key my groups booking. After having to re-key it once, is when she made the mistake in keying my name. When she tried to correct this, someone else had already taken my seat on the flight that I was being re-booked with and my son had already checked in our luggage with that airline because she was working so slowly that it was almost time to board that flight. Mind you, we were in line since about 1.45pm and she began working with us about 2.30pm and boarding with the other Airline was not until 4.59pm. So, since my seat was now gone she instructed me to fly in on another airline separate from my sons (one flying into Dallas then New Orleans and the other flying into Atlanta then New Orleans). This was unacceptable. While waiting for her to resolve everything, we missed boarding for ATL and my son had to have our luggage pulled due to us not making the flight. Lastly, due to her not being able to resolve our flight arrangements in a timely manner we had to cancel our return flight to New Orleans and rent a vehicle to drive from Houston to New Orleans. This was added expense and since the rental car agency requires all cars to returned to IAH airport, we had to spend extra to have it transported back to Houston which was a huge inconvenience. She attempted to smooth things out by offering us a $7 meal voucher each, but that was utterly offensive. Spirit has now lost a loyal customer.",-1
2017-06-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I ditched the tickets,False,"  I purchased a ticket for me and a friend and about a month before the flight from Oakland to Las Vegas my friend was unable to go. I logged into Spirit's website to try and cancel her reservation that I made using my miles but the website wouldn't allow me to change or cancel it. I called their customer service line and was told the ticket needed to be split into two different tickets, I was sent a confirmation code by email to allow me to change her reservation. I used that and looked to see what my options were and one of them was change the date of the flight and receive miles credited back to me. When I tried to log in later to do that I got an error message saying she had to create her own account. I called in to ask why she had to create an account when I booked it using my miles and I was told it's because it couldn't be modified without her creating an account. Ridiculous because I am the one who booked the tickets! They set it up like that just to try and force a new account to be opened. I ditched the tickets and I'm taking it as a loss but I will never fly Spirit again.",-1
2017-06-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Absolute nightmare!,False,"  Orlando to Baltimore. Absolute nightmare! The flight was delayed an hour and then we waited on the plane for an additional hour waiting for mechanical issues to be addressed when the power went off and on and then they told us to exit the plane. I assumed we would be getting on a different plane but no, an hour later they said they could take 36 passengers to fly to Michigan and spend the night to then fly to Baltimore in the morning or stay in Orlando til flight tomorrow which later they said they had no seats available. I called to get refund and to try to find an alternate flight but none were available so I had to get refund and pay out of pocket for different airline next day. However, my 160 I paid cash for baggage they said I would have to wait in line to get and to also get vouchers for food and hotel for my family. But after an hour in line they said since I already got my refund I don't qualify for vouchers and my cash would be sent by check.",-1
2017-05-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Dallas,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,I'd rather fly Delta next time,False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Philadelphia to Dallas. Disregard the fact that their carry-on charges are higher than regular baggage (and bags don't always arrive the same day!) and that they charge for snacks (including water), their schedules are really messed up. On my first flight, we waited for just over an hour on the runway because we were there early. Seriously? And on my way back, we spent well over an hour and a half before taking off. I'd rather fly Delta next time and take my chances.",-1
2017-05-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the absolute worst experience,False,"  Portland to Los Angeles. This was the absolute worst experience I've had with an airline. I booked this flight on Expedia and was initially charged $70. The day of the flight, I began receiving emails notifying me that I would have to pay and extra fee for carry on luggage and to pick a seat. This cost me another $80. Just before I left for the airport, Spirit sent a series of about 20 emails informing me that the flight had been delayed to various times. After I had made my way through security at the airport, I checked my email again and it said the flight had been canceled. A group of bewildered passengers were standing around the gate not knowing what to do because there was no one from Spirit there to help us. I went back the service counter to find a line of about 100 irate people and 2 spirit employees incompetently trying to tell us that they had no idea when they might be able to get us home. I went to Southwest and booked a flight home for another $240. While waiting for my flight, I called Spirit to get a refund, but was told there would be at least a 2 hour wait on hold. Two days later, I was finally able to get through to Spirit, and they were only willing to refund $80. So, in the end, I was provided no service what-so-ever and was out of pocket $310. Lesson learned: never fly with Spirit. EVER.",-1
2017-05-30,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Orlando,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I recommend this airline,False,  The flight crew were hilarious and welcoming. The in-flight food and beverages affordable. This airline encourages minimalism and I have no issue with that. I flew from NYC to Orlando for $102 round trip. A slight delay coming back due to weather and received vouchers via email with an apology. I recommend this airline.,1
2017-05-29,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to New Orleans,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,very happy with this airline,False,  Dallas to New Orleans. Very happy with this airline and prices! I made sure to carefully read all guide lines and had no issues. I was able to get a big comfortable chair for $30 more and it was awesome. Will book again and even debating on their $9 fare club. Wish they offered flights to Europe.,1
2017-05-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,3.0,a horrible experience,False,"  A horrible experience with this airline. Flew from Chicago to Vegas with Spirit Airlines, seats were double booked but they found me another. On the way back to Chicago, well I couldn't tell you because my flight got cancelled! Stood in a line with the rest of the passengers for over 1.5hrs. They had 2 agents working a line of over 200 people. Kept moving us around and people kept losing their spot in line. Obviously frustrated passengers all trying to take advantage of the moving of the lines, and jumping ahead. I got my cancellation notice on the way to the airport. They basically said they had no other flights available, and told people maybe tomorrow or the next day - and they don't cover hotel costs. The person I was flying with had a medical condition, I made very clear to the agent that we had a hospital appointment the next morning and we needed to be on a flight tonight. I told her she can decide on the urgency of this, and I was making it very clear that this was not a normal situation. She put us on a flight with AA that was leaving at midnight, and landing us at our destination at 6am, and for our troubles we each received a wonderful $7 voucher! Overall a horrible experience, they didn't know how to gain control of the situation and had appx. 200 very angry passengers. They were not even communicating with each other. A total circus act!",-1
2017-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is hard on your wallet,False,"  Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I purchased the tickets through Expedia and almost canceled the reservation shortly after. The fare is about $20 less per ticket than the next one. More importantly, its departure time and nonstop 6 hour flight was ideal. Little did I know, as soon as I booked and paid, a link directed me to a site for seat selection. Spirit charge $12 or more to select a seat and only allow a free carry on size 18x14x8. Add the luggage fee, there is no saving to fly low budget. I called Expedia asking to cancel this booking and was informed I had to contact Spirit directly. Of course, it is not possible to talk to anyone there. We arrived the gate 40 min before scheduled departure time and learned the flight was delayed 54 min. With no flight at the gate and the posted time unchanged, we decided to get food. More than a half hour before the posted departure time, we returned to the gate and found it closed, no agent there and flight was leaving in 10 min. The departure time was changed to 22 min earlier than last posting. When the agent reappeared, those of us missed the flight were told there will be no refund of any shape and form, no help from Spirit to find other airlines and the best they can do is to fly us 48 hours later. The answer to our question on why such short notice of changed time is “there is delay between the time we know and the time shows on the screens”. I did not know the existence of Spirit before this event and wish I had never seen its logo on Expedia site. Spirit is hard on your wallet and bad for your health.",-1
2017-05-25,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to Myrtle Beach,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,not experienced any problems,False,"  Niagara Falls to Myrtle Beach. I have flown with Spirit over the past 24 months and not experienced any problems. The booking process was easy, I paid for what I wanted and nothing more. I like the bare fare and add what you need style of booking.The pricing is exceptional compared to other airlines. The planes are new, clean and crew have been exceptionally friendly. Every flight I have been on has been booked full, left on time and arrived on time. I fly to Myrtle Beach SC and to Orlando FL from Niagara Falls, NY The only downside with Spirit Airlines is if there are delays they do not have a standby flight readily available for you to take. They do offer vouchers, hotel stays etc to make up for any delays or cancellations. I am sure that this is something the airline is working to improve on. If you understand the ""ala carte"" booking approach with Spirit Airlines you will appreciate their process of saving you money! I would not hesitate to recommend this airlines to anyone!",1
2017-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Atlantic City via FLL,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Now stuck in airport,False,"  Cancun to Atlantic City via Fort Lauderdale. Plane lands in Fort Lauderdale, then takes 25 minutes to get to the gate. Reason unknown. Have to go through customs with our luggage. Get through, running, and the say to put our luggage on the recheck belt. Miss our connecting flight, due to 25 minutes awaiting for the gate. Go up to see what they can do for us. And she says find another flight - it was 8:30 pm! This plane was going to Atlantic City and sitting there. Why did they not hold it for over 30 passengers who are late and will be stranded that they knew about? Now stuck in airport. No blankets, benches, food areas (stuck in baggage area), and about 12 chairs.  Now no flights available for 2 more days! Two employees working on the problem with about 50 people in line, no supervisors, no announcements, water or compassion!",-1
2017-05-24,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Denver,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,very clear about their charges,False,"  Phoenix to Denver. I have read a lot of bad reviews of this airline. What people have to remember is this is a budget airline. Spirit Airlines is very clear about their charges, so you know going in that any extras are going to cost. The fees are clearly stated. Spirit lists their prices as ""bare fare"" and you have the choice at time of booking to add extras you want. When I need to book a flight, I pack light so I am not charged a carry on fee, I check in online so I don't pay a check in fee and I make sure I am not going to have any changes to my tickets. The only extra I pay for is the extra roomy seat, which is very comfortable. I eat a good healthy meal before I board so I am not hungry. Preparation is the key to flying a budget airline.",1
2017-05-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Boston,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,4.0,1.0,no full refund for cancelled flight,False,"  Atlanta to Boston. The website sends you around in circles while it tries to upsell you. Oh, you want to bring a carry-on? it'll cost you. Oh, you want to sit in a seat? $32 please. Then when you finally get to your object, ""check me in,"" the screen turns white and you have to start over. This happens innumerable times, in fact until you accept one of the 'upgrades.' When you call them you go on hold for 15 minutes. When a representative finally answers, she drops your call. They delay your return flight twice and then cancel it. You are stranded in Boston. They do not have friendly relations with other airlines, so they can't put you on a flight with another carrier. They offer you a ride home the following day, Boston to Atlanta, with layovers at Denver and LAX. It departs at 9am and arrives at 6pm - if it arrives. Do you believe them at this point, even if you are such a fool as to accept these terms - 9hrs Boston to Atlanta? They will not give you a hotel voucher for your overnight in in Boston. There is no full refund for your cancelled flight. Your flight to Boston, according to their math - it's not on the receipt - was $120. Your return to ATL was $60. They offer you the $60.

I haven't even gotten into the plane yet and it's been terrible. I thought I would save a few dollars and wha a mistake! Between one checked bag, one carry on and a regular seat I have paid $127.00. It has cost me more to travel on this airline than the other carriers that don't nickel and dime you to death and are kind to you.",-1
2017-05-22,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the most horrific experience,False,"  Atlanta to Los Angeles. This has been the most horrific experience of all of my experiences during my travels. Spirit is not a very accommodating airline. First, my flight was delayed only for me to arrive and learn that my flight left on time. As it was so rudely explained to me by an employee, I should have read the fine print and I would have know to arrive at my original time despite the information provided in the alert. Explain, what's the purpose of sending alerts if I have no other choice but to be there at my original time. Second, the customer service is less than professional! In fact, with the exception of one employee, the entire staff employed punitive tactics to engineer a process which should have been a seamless smooth transition for customers. In other words, their jobs were to provide a courteous and friendly customer service in a professional manner. I lost ~$900 due to the inconvenience of this airline without so much as an apology for the inconvenience.",-1

Worst airline I've ever flown with. Advertising with cheap flights and then you have to pay 60$ just to bring your carry-on. The staff was rude, the lines were ridiculous and inefficient. On a 3 hour flight, you aren't even given water. You have to pay for any beverage or snack. It was an incredibly frustrating process, and I definitely will never be flying with Spirit Airline ever again.",-1
2017-05-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,their customer service is poor,False,"  Horrible experience. We were supposed to fly this morning from Chicago to Las Vegas and the flight was cancelled. Spend almost 3 hours in lines to find another flight. Next flight they offered was in 14 hours. We told them that we have a hotel booked and they said they had nothing to do with that. After we cancelled our flight tickets, they offer a voucher for next time. Never in my lifetime will I choose Spirit Airlines. Their customer service is poor. Not even one star can be given to a business like this. I hope people will read and write more reviews to help them to go out of business.",-1
2017-05-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,would walk before I fly Spirit,False,"  Dallas to Los Angeles. Let me start by saying that I did not book my own flight and was not aware of Sprit Airline.  I had round trip tickets which my friend had booked for me. My first part was with Virgin and my return was with Sprit. LAX to Dallas with Virgin America $59.53 flight $18.67 tax and fees $0.00. soda ($78.20) Total I chose to spend $3.00 to buy an earphone and watch TV above my food tray. Comfortable seats even though I was sitting in the middle. Chair reclined and, was able to watch TV all the way. Employees were very nice and professional. Dallas to LAX with Spirit $39.98. Flight $17.21 tax and fees $55.00 carryon bag charge $8.00 seat charge $3.00. Water ($113.19. Total) Chairs were hard, did not recline, no TV and employees at the gate were very rude. Not everyone can understand a person talking fast with heavy accent and do not dare to ask them to repeat what she said. The bottom line is, I would walk before I fly with Spirit Airlines.",-1
2017-05-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cleveland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,regret every second of this choice,False," I'll start off by saying that I'm not even 24 hours into this reservation with Spirit and I regret every second of this choice. I guess this airline is great if your a young adult with wonderlust and you travel with just a purse and a dream but if that's not you, then don't book it. They have what seems to be fair prices for flights (Los Angeles to Cleveland), but then come the charges and such. I traveled with my husband and upon going online to check everything out, we see that we can pick seats. Now, you can choose to have seats with more leg room and such but your going to pay. I thought we could just do the assigned seating thing - wrong! If you don't pay to choose your seats, they will just assign you wherever they want and whatever is left. So your spouse or child could be at the front of the plane, you in the middle, and somebody else in the back. We paid for the upgraded seats (they had more leg room anyway) and we were checking out to pay for that and they ask if we want to pay for our bags. We think, no that's OK, we just have a backpack each (2 day trip) so well just carry on - think again. If you have anything larger than a laptop bag you're paying. A carry on costs $42 each or you can join their $9 club to have your carry on only cost $31 each! Don't even ask how much a bigger bag is. So we did the natural thing; we called and complained. The person on the other end barely speaks English and begins reciting off what I'm reading off the website. So were angry, lets cancel our reservation. On the phone they will offer to do it for a 30% charge of your booking. So they suggest we do it online which is a 20% charge. We don't fly until the end of June.  It's not like some last minute cancellation, we tried to cancel a reservation we made less that 24 hours ago. So, lets just say if your reading this and you are thinking about booking a flight with the airline - please don't. Pay the extra $20 or $30 or even $70 to avoid this airline. I can't even begin to describe how awful this experience  and I haven't even got on a plane yet.",-1
2017-05-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Minneapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,rude customer service,False,  Terrible experience on my Spirit flight from Denver to Minneapolis. My only personal item fit in the baggage check box and they let me get on each flight with it 3 differnt times this trip. On my layover in Las Vegas I go to get on the plane and the lady told me that I had to pay for my bag. I told her I didn't have to the last 3 times and she said you have to pay or you can't come on. I explained to her I was just in this plane with no charge for the same bag and she still made me pay. I paid it obviously but I wasn't happy about her rude customer service.,-1
2017-05-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Los Angeles,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,I wouldn't have bought the ticket,False,"  
Flew Spirit from Denver to Los Angeles. I bought my ticket from a 3rd party site and wasn't informed that I would be paying $55 bucks for a carry on. If I had known this I wouldn't have bought the ticket. It was a good deal until my bags coat 50% of what it cost me to fly. I will never be using Spirit again. $55 bucks is a lot of money for some of us trying to take a vacation from our struggles in life. This is a bad business practice.",-1
2017-05-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Minneapolis,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,zero empathy for passengers,False,"  Portland to Minneapolis. This airline is seriously troubled. I booked round trip from Portland to Minneapolis. Each flight had a connection, the first in LA, and on the way back Chicago. Each time my first flight was delayed. The first flight to LA they assured me at the gate I would make my connection. Nope, we get to LA and they closed the door not 5 mins before we arrived they forced us to leave the terminal to go to the ticket counter to talk to a supervisor. We waited over an hour for him to show up, he said we would have to wait 24 hours for the next flight. Gave us no hotel voucher or anything just stranded us 3000 miles from our destination the guy even refused to show me his employee badge. So I bought a ticket on delta to get to Minneapolis. On the way back I decided to try again this time we boarded on time. Once we got on they claimed they needed to change a tire we sat on the tarmac for over an hour. Needless to say another connection missed and hundreds waisted on another ticket. Don't book with these clowns, they are rude unaccomidating and have zero empathy for passengers.",-1
2017-05-15,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Boston,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,I had no problems whatsoever,False,"  I flew from Chicago to Boston yesterday. When I booked the flight with Spirit, through a third party website, I didn't realize that you had to pay for carry on luggage. You're allowed one small personal item, and I was bound and determined to make it work. So I bought a small backpack and a space bag. I'm only here for a week and have access to a washer and dryer, so I didn't really need that many clothes. Once I vacuumed the air out of the bag it held four outfits and two sets of pajamas, as well as bras underwear and socks. I was also able to pack makeup, medicines and personal care items. I still can't believe how much I was able to fit into that bag. My round trip ticket was $160, so I decided to upgrade to a bigger seat in the front of the plane, and I was so glad I did. It only cost $30 extra each way, which still made the trip very affordable the staff was courteous and friendly, it left on time and even arrived a little early. From all the reviews I had read before this trip I was dreading the travel, but I had no problems whatsoever and would definitely use this airline again in the future.",1
2017-05-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Los Angeles​,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I expected there to be a flight,False,"  Flew Spirit from Oakland to Los Angeles​. I had flown budget airlines in Europe, and while I expected the flight to be sub par, I expected there to be a flight. Delay on top of delay and then a cancelation 3 hours behind schedule. Then they cancelled all afternoon flights so rerouting was a nightmare. No weather was involved btw, this is California. I will say the employees were great but were giving nothing to work with from their company. The earliest option was a flight 7 hours after our initial departure. Between the money I spent at the airport, and then having to rebook the ticket last minute, save yourself the hassel and go with an airline you can trust to get you there - anything but Spirit.",-1

I was very hesitant and nervous after reading so many bad reviews about Spirit Airlines, but I can't say our trip was anywhere near horrible. From check in to landing at our destination everything went smoothly and the staff was exceptional. Moral of the story don't believe everything you read!",1
2017-05-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Los Cabos,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,flight has been canceled,False,"  Bought 3 sets of tickets from San Diego to Los Cabos a week prior traveling.A day before the trip, Spirit sends me an email stating that the flight has been canceled. ""Sorry, your flight has been canceled."" That is it. The refund will come in 7 business day. What if I didn't have the money to pay for a new set of 3 round trips, I would lose the hotel and car reservations, too? This is absurd and outrageous. Spirit is good as the next airline. All of them benefit from this ridiculous (de)regulation our government has imposed on consumers.",-1
2017-05-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,do not fly with this airline,False,"  Boston to Fort Lauderdale. They send me 4 notifications for delayed flight on the morning of my flight. I had to take a bus for eight hours from Caribou, Maine. Then cancelled a few hours prior to my time I was supposed to leave from Logan at 6:15 pm. I spent the whole day arguing with bad customer service reps who were in capable of making any dedication I was on hold for three hours wasted my whole day plus I'm disabled with no money for hotels. They say I have a fifty dollar voucher for the airline expires in June so I have to spend more money and they do not even provide service to my next stop. They refused to help me at all. I did get there from another airline that I had to fight for that. Left hours later, no bad weather or any information was given. They constantly avoided helping me or answering and of my questions. I would ask them a question they would avoid it, repeat the same thing three or four times that was not the question I asked. Horrible, do not fly with this airline.",-1
2017-05-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,staff were underwhelming and unhelpful,False,"  This is the first and last time I will ever fly Spirit. I am a frequent flier and thought I'd use Spirit Airlines for a buisiness trip in Los Angeles. My initial flight was from KCI-LAX which was a 3 hour flight. That one got cancelled and I rebooked for the next day to a flight that had a layover in Detroit. I got to Detroit and that one got cancelled. The next flight out of Detroit with Spirit would be the next day so I decided to buy a ticket with a different airline to get to LAX that night (which was amazingly smooth sailing compared to Spirit). I was scheduled to depart the following Monday morning and guess what? That flight got cancelled too! I had to rent the hotel I was at for a whole other day and stayed until the next day in the afternoon (which was also a delayed flight). Seats were uncomfortable, staff were underwhelming and unhelpful with giving explanations for all the cancellations, and took way too long to help everyone get where they needed to be. I had to take matters into my own hands and ended up spending a lot more than I wanted to. Save yourself from this nightmare and get another airline!",-1
2017-05-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Managua to Dallas via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,So we missed our flight,False,"  Managua to Dallas via Fort Lauderdale.  The flight attendants have no customer service skills what so ever. They dont even smile when you board or get off the flight.  Seats are horrible and don't recline. Extremely expensive for everything. They even charge you $10 to talk to customer service when checking in. No one knows what they are talking about either, they all look lost in the airport. Then my husband and I are traveling back home from our honeymoon, of course have to go through customs. Our flight landed at 5.30am and our connecting flight was at 7am. Customs took longer than that. So we missed our flight. We bought insurance in case and turns out that if customs makes you miss your flight there is nothing they can do except get you on the next available flight. For us, that is over 24 hours away and we have to be at work. And then there are the lines - we stood in line to recheck our luggage for over an hour. Needless to say, we are trying to get our money back so we can book another airline so we can actually go home today.",-1
2017-05-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Baltimore,,,,,,1.0,1.0,either delayed or cancelled,False,"  The worst! An email last night reported that our upcoming flight would be ""either delayed or cancelled"". That's a big difference. I was on hold over an hour to no avail. The website gave no information. Today we were informed the tomorrow's flight was cancelled. No assistance on re-booking. Only one flight available this week, tonight. I will never use Spirit Airlines again. The cost savings is not worth it for travel disruptions, terrible service, and great discomfort.",-1
2017-05-10,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Minneapolis,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1.0,I got to live the whole Spirit experience,False,"  I have flown Spirit at least 10 times in the past 3 years from LAX to MSP. I have always used their services under the idea that you get what you pay for, so I am not expecting too much other than on time. I always pay for everything else that is not included on their bare fares, so pretty much everything, from water to snacks or seats. Not a problem. If it is not included, it is extra. Departure: Usually late, which it is usually no big deal if it is 15-20 or even 30 minutes. Customer Service on the ground: Pretty decent, but once again you are only paying a very small fare, so you cannot expect the airline to go above and beyond, as their employees do not get paid much either and that reflects in their service (at least here at LAX). But this last time 5/4/17, my flight departure was late over an hour after scheduled time. We were able to board and we waited another 35-45 minutes until we were told that there was an issue with the pilots running late. When the pilots finally arrived, the whole plane applauded as we thought we've thought we had a pilot. The pilot and the crew went in and out of the pit and walked up and down the plane (crew) for 30 minutes. All of a sudden a crew member that was not part of the LAX-MSP flight got on the intercom or pager and informed the passengers to: get their belongings and proceed to the Spirit counter as the flight had been cancelled. My first thought it was that it was a joke, but the crew member repeated himself in a tone, not apologetic, it was more as if he was the chosen one to announce the bad news. The entire flight headed to the counter and that's were I got to live the whole Spirit experience. We formed a long line that had no direction and the unhelpful reps at the counters were not trying to explain the process to re-book or to advise what were our options. Once again they sent their employee with the worst attitude to direct people to the correct lines as other passengers from other flights were arriving to check in as well. More than one hour and a half on hold for the solution with their 800 number ""we are putting you on the next day flight"" or cancellation with option to get a refund or coupon for a future purchase flight. When I asked if they can do anything for this huge inconvenience, food or drinks, the tone on the employee was almost as if I had asked for a kidney and she gave me a nasty look. When asked if they can put me in a hotel, she quickly replied that they were all booked. The place was loud as you can imagine with a whole flight at the counter line so the direction from Spirit was not clear, many passengers asked if they could repeat the options and the employee said ""it is not my fault that the girl giving the information was not loud enough, you can talk to my manager and tell him that she messed up and not me"". Once again, rude, no manners or education. Overall experience: awful, please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",-1
2017-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Naples,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Stay away from Spirit Airlines,False,"  Detroit to Naples. Booked and paid weeks ahead of flight lots of seats available at time of booking but didnt take the extra cash grab of booking seats. Arrived at Detroit over 2.5 hrs ahead of flight, went to kiosk only to find out the seats were not assigned. We find the flight is overbooked. I will never fly Spirit Airlines ever again nor recommend them. We had to constantly go to the counter. We are a family of 4 and it was a booked holiday. Afer being blown off by their non caring poor attitude staff we finally got on board. They were trying to bump us to get the 4 seats. Until the government forbids overbooking and deals with the airline industry this problem will not go away. Stay away from Spirit Airlines. They have a negative spirit.",-1
2017-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,all seemed very unorganized,False,"  Las Vegas to Chicago. It was our first time for my wife and I to fly on Spirit. A week before our flight, we received an email inviting us to check our bags for our upcoming flight. So, we did - each of us had one bag to check at a cost of $40 per bag per trip or $160 round trip bag charge. And in the same email, we we're invited to check our seats. We could elect to let Spirit randomly select our seats in which case, there would be no guarantee that my wife and I would sit together or, we could select our seats for a charge. So, we elected to ""buy"" our seat assignments. We did not select any ""premium"" seats but it still cost us a total of $84 round trip just for seats. In total, we spent $244 just for checked bags and for assigned seats so my wife and I were guaranteed to sit together. Regarding Spirit's staff at the baggage check counter, the gate, as well, as on the plane, they all seemed very unorganized with little to no leadership. Bottom line, the additional cost of checking our bags (which by the way cannot exceed 40 lbs without an additional charge) and having to buy our seats ended up costing us the same or more than if we had selected Southwest or Delta. Not to mention the uncomfortable 3 hour flight. Will we ever fly Spirit again? Absolutely not. Will we ever recommend Spirit? Absolutely not.",-1

The flight crew was really nice and professional. The plane was clean. The seats was Ok. Overall I had a comfortable and good experience. Coming back home was also smooth. Only thing I didnt really like was the $50 check bag fee, but I would definitely book with Spirit again.",1
2017-05-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly Spirit again,False,"  Detroit to Denver. At the end of my last review they had delayed the flight that they had already canceled once, and I wondering whether this flight would actually go out or if it too would be canceled. Guess what, it was canceled for the second day in a row. Apparently they once again had too few crew members. All they offer me was a refund and a $100 voucher for the airline I never want to use again, or to take a flight that had approximately 4 layovers and would turn a 3.5 hour trip into a 10 hour one. Seeing as I have already missed the event I was planning on going to on Saturday, I chose to take the refund. And I will never fly Spirit again. One of the attendants at the gate apologized, but other than that they could not have cared less. I have been looking forward to this trip for months and now I have to reschedule (but this time I will schedule with an airline where the crew actually shows up).",-1

Went to check in luggage and they told me the flight was canceled. They did give me a full refund but not for the reservations in Orlando we missed. They gave me and my girlfriend $200 in vouchers but they expire in 2 months and I have no reason to fly anywhere in the next 2 months. They didn't bother to contact me ahead of time telling me so the hotel I stayed in the night before was a waste of money. Will never fly Spirit Airlines again. Also I still see people sitting the the terminal. It appears Spirit Airlines never informed several people the the flight was canceled.,-1
2017-05-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Minneapolis via Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1.0,airline is not worth your time,False,"  Portland to Minneapolis via Chicago. This airline is not worth your time. If you are trying to save a few dollars like me by choosing the cheapest ticket, you are in for a world of frustration. This airline will try to nickel and dime you at every turn. My original flight was cancelled the day before it was scheduled and I had to spend over an hour on the phone talking to incompetent ""customer service"" staff to get on a another flight. Then the flight that I was re-accommodated to was cancelled 8 hours before it was scheduled to depart. So I had to spend another hour on the phone with ""customer service"" to be re-accomodated again. All I asked for in return for this blatant waste of my time and energy was for a free carry-on, which I was refused.  I haven't actually flown with them yet so stay tuned for a second review. If you like being treated like cattle then this is the perfect airline for you.",-1

Six hours before flight find out it was canceled and had to book different flight. When I go to airport the next day I found out that one was canceled and they booked a different flight. Six hours later they tell me that one will be delayed. After that they put me on different airline so that I could make it to my pool tournament, where I missed the first match. On day of return flight found out that one was canceled. Spent 5 hours on hold to get put on different airline so I could try and get home for work. When I told them how much money I lost with the pool tournament and one day lost work they offer me a $50 voucher to use, that was the third one they offered. They reason they said flights were messed up was because of low staff. Would give a zero rating but would not let me.",-1
2017-05-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Montego Bay,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,Spirit is by far the worse,False,"  Atlanta to Montego Bay. I've had bad flight experiences before on other airlines, but Spirit is by far the worse. My flight on the way to Jamaica was delayed, no update on that until after we should have already departed. Once in Ft. Lauderdale, another delay. Flight was delayed, I wasn't surprised. It was raining pretty bad so I understood, but I didn't understand not being updapted in a timely manner. Then we got another update, that we would be delayed even further. Our plane and crew were re-routed to Kingston d/t weather. So now our flight that should have left about 2:45p was going to leave close to 6p. Another update, now the flight crew will be illegal to fly after the extra stop in Kingston, which they clearly knew would put them out of range of hours to fly. Now we won't be able leave until the next day at 7a & bring told there were no connecting flights until Tuesday. Our original flight was on Friday so now that would require us to get a hotel for the night in Montego Bay & again in Ft. Lauderdale on Sat. until we could get a flight on Sunday. Then they say our flight is not canceled it's extended delay. The manager says I don't know or can tell you where you can sleep tonight. I wanted to speak with someone about a partial refund, I was given a card to call someone. Really? I now have to use my cell phone to incur international phone fees to discuss a refund so I can buy another ticket home. There was never a sincere apology, updated were not timely, no thanks for your patience while we try our best to get you all home safely, no offering of water considering most of us had now been at the airport for over 6 hours. They were not going to pay for a night of lodging, not cool but at least a list of nearby hotels could have been offered. My biggest issue I had was the lack of service. Of course I wanted to get home, but providing the best service experience under the circumstances would have been appreciated to say the least. Let's not talk about all the additional fees after purchasing your airline ticket. I really could go on and on, but just know, I'll never fly spirit ever again and if and when I hear anyone mention Spirit I'll be sure they know my experience.",-1
2017-05-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas via San Diego,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,I have learned my lesson,False,"  Chicago to Las Vegas via San Diego. I understand that Spirit Airlines is a ""discount"" ""no frills "" airline, but poor customer care is absolutely unacceptable. We got to the airport to be told that our fight was cancelled because there was no staff to work the fight and the next available wasn't till the next day, so we took that one. Only to fly from Chicago to San Diego and find out that the connecting flight to Vegas was delayed more than two hrs. Oh Spirit was real concerned about me missing the first day of a conference that was more than a $1000.00 to attend. They were so concerned that they put us up in a hotel in Chicago with meal vouchers that would barley cover the cost of bowl of cold cereal. Then they were so kind to offer us $50.00 discounts on the ticket portion of a flight only, that expired in 60 days. So basically if this fight 356 to Las Vegas on May 7th 2017 ever gets here I we will be more than a day and half late!! Then they have the gall to ask for volunteers to bump because they over booked it by a couple seats and offer two free round trip tickets anywhere they fly, but for the people that get an entire flight cancelled, they get nothing! So long Spirit Airlines I have learned my lesson. Don't fly with Spirit you will get burned.",-1
2017-05-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Cancun,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never consider flying with Spirit again,False,"  My girlfriend and I booked a flight from Houston to Cancun for her best friends wedding. Neither of us had used Spirit before, but we're in the process of buying a house and wanted to save a little money. This was going to be a short weekend getaway. Thursday 5/4/2017 rolls around and we're packing our bags around 9:45pm when I get an email saying our flight for Friday 5/5/2017 at 11:20am is now cancelled. Thinking it's weather related, I give Spirit a call thinking they will help us work something out. I sit on hold for over an hour and reach the first associate. He is helpful and says since we're attending a wedding, he'll transfer us to their booking department to get us on another airline as Spirit had nothing for the next day. I wait, and wait - and wait for 3 hours on the phone. It's now almost midnight 5/4/2017. So I pick up another phone and dial in while I'm still on hold with the first. I reach someone after about 30 minutes who gives me the same spiel as the first, and puts me on hold again. I'm now on hold on two different phone lines. After another hour I decide I can't take it anymore. I hang up both lines and call back a third time. It's now 1am and I'm just ready for a refund. I get through to the third associate and she offers a refund and says ""Oh, so you'll miss the wedding, huh?"" to which I reply ""Yes, and lose hundreds of dollars on our hotel room!"". ""I'm sorry, sir"" is all I got in broken english. I ask why the flight was cancelled and am told ""Due to a crew issue, we do not have a pilot for that flight"". Who schedules out a flight for hundreds of people and doesn't have a pilot or back up pilot? In hindsight, maybe if I would have held on hold for another couple of hours I could have rebooked a flight. But while I was on hold I was searching flights on other airlines and coming up with nothing. There was one United Flight leaving HOU on 5/5/2017, but they wanted over $1300 1-way. I just couldn't swing that while waiting on my refund from Spirit for 7-10 business days. Thanks for ruining our weekend, a wedding, and ever having a chance at us being customers. We will never consider flying with Spirit again. I should have listened to the horror stories that are all over the internet. Now I'm out hundreds of dollars from the hotel room and transportation, and we missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to see our friend's wedding.",-1
2017-05-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,our first and last experience with Spirit,False,"  
Flying from Denver to Las Vegas on 5/4/17, our flight was initially delayed an hour and fifteen minutes, no big deal. Then we were told our flight was delayed another hour and a half due to ""we can't find our flight attendants."" The flight was delayed another hour with no updates. We finally ended up leaving nearly four and a half hours after our original time. Now, on our flight back to Denver, while waiting to check our bag I overhear a Spirit member say they cancelled 5 flights today due to ""low staff"". While waiting at the gate, you announce they are overbooked and are asking for people to take alnerate flights - not sure which other flights are even available since they've already cancelled 5 and it's only 7.00am. Thankfully ours wasn't cancelled, but we're sitting on the plane, all boarded, when they tell us we are going to be stuck here an hour - on the plane - because we're ""waiting on a member from Denver"". I asked a flight attendant what that exactly means and she told me she has no idea. She said, ""I'm not sure what's going on, we're all here. Our crew is all here, I don't know why we can't leave"". All of this and Spirit is offering a $50 voucher to fly with them in the next 28 days. This has been our first and last experience with Spirit for sure. I will never recommend anyone to fly with this poorly run company. They're proud being the ""youngest in the fleet"", well clearly they have a lot of growing up to do before they can be taken seriously.",-1
2017-05-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this has been an awful experience,False,"  When I arrived at the airport on May 6th at 5 a.m. I was informed that my flight to Denver had been canceled due to ""unavaible crew members"". I was told there were no flights out until the next day, so I quickly booked myself on that flight, even though I would now be missing the event that prompted me to fly to Denver in the first place. A couple of hours before that flight was scheduled to leave it was delayed by 30 minutes. As we finally lined up to board, they informed us that the flight was being delayed an additional hour because a ""crew member was not yet available"". I am now waiting, hoping I will actually be able to take the trip I have been looking forward to for months. I booked with Spirit because of their lower fares, but I might not actually be able to get to my destination. I will not be flying Spirit again in the future and advise anyone who is flying out for a time sensitive event, to do the same. I have received one ""We're Sorry"" email and a $50 voucher that I apparently need to use in the next two months or it will expire. This has been an awful experience. Don't trust Spirit.",-1
2017-05-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New York LGA to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no crew for the flight,False," Spirit is the most untrustworthy airline. They sent me a email at 7pm in the evening that my New York LGA to Chicago flight is cancelled. Upon calling, they conveniently placed us on hold for 2 hrs and there is no customer service still. We called on other Flight Cancellations: 801-401-2299 and it is been more then 1 hr. on hold. Now I don't know what to do for my flight. Please don't fly with this airline, they offer you cheap price tickets but then at the end they cancelled the flight and reason will make you laugh - ""due to no crew for the flight"". Can you believe it? Next reason might be ""we don't have pilots""",-1

Not only was the flight light on passengers but there was ton of bins to put bags, if I had known my bag was too big I would have prepaid, such a rip off. They stop you at the last minute and force you to pay for bags so they can make more money. Will never fly with them again and I normally fly twice a year with them.",-1

I had enough miles to go to Mrytle Beach, booked non-stop flight well in advance, month later get email saying bumped from non stop and put on one stop via LaGuardia. Original flight was scheduled to depart - arrive 12noon-2pm, new flight 6am-6.45pm, so evidently if you sign up and use their credit card you can use the miles only if they have room, even if you book well in advance you will be bumped forcing you to change or even cancel your plans.",-1
2017-05-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,forced to accept another destination,False,"  Traveling with my wife and 2 kids (3&5). Flight canceled at the last minute and after waiting 4 hours begging for water and another flight home to FLL they gave me a flight to a different city - MIA (50 miles away). They told me that they had already booked me on a Miami flight for the next day and if I wanted it, good, if not to buy my own ticket. I was forced to accept another destination because they decided to send me to another city! Spirit is treating their customers like animals trying to take advantage of the fact that we are helpless when it comes to options and anyone to care for us. Again traveling with 2 minors and forced to fly to another city because the Spirit staff member felt that I was fine flying to a different city.",-1

Had connecting flights in Fort Lauderdale for outbound and inbound flights. 1st connecting flight was delayed for over 4 hours, so I had to purchase a hotel room for my once year old son and diabetic mother. Connecting flight back home was cancelled. They also lost my stroller so I had to carry my 1 year old through the entire airport. Now I am going to have to pay for more ground transportation and another hotel room. This airline is a certifiable joke. I've been waiting in line over 2 hours to rebook and I'm only halfway through the line. Not to mention they only have limited agents rebooking all these people. The line is out the door and around the corner. Literally.",-1
2017-05-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airline I have experienced,False,"  This is the worst airline I have experienced. I have been warned about not flying Spirit, but I said how bad can it be. Well, it's worse than imaginable. We booked a flight 1 month prior. The night before we receive an email saying our flight is cancelled. I called Spirit to see what was going on, but they couldn't provide a reason and just apologized. They said they can book us for a late night flight going out the same day (3 hours after our call) 9pm. It was our only choice so we took it and rushed to the airport. We get to the airport and checked in 1.5 hours before the flight. 9pm arrived, but there was still no plane. To make matters worse, all of the airline staff left, and there was nobody to update us about what is going on. All the passengers started wondering what was going on, but no answer or anyone around to help. I checked the flight number online to see if I could get an answer and it said our plane was delayed 2 hours! Meanwhile everyone was sitting around like animals at a zoo, and nobody even cared to let us know that our plane was going to be delayed. Finally over an hour later a Spirit employee shows up, but didn't even bother to tell us about any delay or update us. I ended up asking for my money back and left. I would not ride with them again if they paid me let alone me paying them. I have been told this happens a lot, but always questioned how bad can it be. An extra 20$ is worth saving yourself a headache and your sanity. I wish I had listened to family and friends that told me not to do it.",-1
2017-05-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Tampa via Houston,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,communication was awful,False,"  Absolute worst experience! Will never fly Spirit again. I was flying from San Diego to Tampa today but had a layover in Houston. While we arrived in Houston on time, there was an accident that occurred. One of the cabinets came open hitting a flight attendant in the head. She was removed from the aircraft. While this was awful, it unfortunately caused Spirit to delay the Tampa flight because they were now down one crew member. We waited over an hour for a replacement. Once boarded, we sat on the tarmac for two hours. A storm came through. After over two hours on the tarmac they turned our plane around and cancelled our flight even though other planes were still taking off. They then refused to send us to other airlines for flights as they claimed the delay was weather related, remember it was their safety problem that started this mess. They offered us flights out of Houston 3 days later saying that was the best they could do because the powers that be would not approve any other options. Their desk staff were rude and communication was awful. Even though their fares are less expensive it is worth the extra dollars spent at other airlines for piece of mind. I will never use this airline again and suggest you do the same.",-1

I always give second chances but now, it's 3 strikes and you're out. I am sitting and waiting for 2 hours after being sent from one gate to another meaning I had to go through the nightmare baggage check twice and had to throw out my food and beverages because of the second baggage check. This airline is not worth the savings. Horrible with their delays. I have 8 emails just today with all of the time changes and that is not an exaggeration. Not the first time and never again!",-1
2017-04-30,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit Airlines is such a joke,False,"  Dallas to Denver. Spirit Airlines is such a joke. We had originally booked a round trip ticket. Like every flight, ours was delayed so we rebooked on another flight with a different carrier. Because we didn't fly our first leg they evidently cancelled our return flight. Obviously, they don't inform you they have cancelled you, I tried checking in online only to hit a wall. Call them so they can clairfy their policy will cancel you if you don't travel on your initial flight.",-1
2017-04-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft. Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,that the flight was canceled!,False,"  Newark to Ft. Lauderdale. Wow, where do I begin? Would have been my first time flying Spirit. I knew about their bare bones setup. Throughout the day before he flight, I received multiple emails telling me flight is delayed by about 50 minutes. Already didn't sit well. Got checked in, waited at the gate. Half hour before departure, while others are boarding, they announced that the flight was canceled! Didn't give a reason. Just said to go down to the ticketing booth. Of course what would be a plane full of people rushed to said ticketing booth, where 3 agents were there to take care of what appeared to be 150+ people. This was around 9pm on a Friday night. Lines barely moved. Ended up calling Spirit Airlines. They claim mechanic issue, and I had 3 choices. Rebook for the next flight on their airline tomorrow afternoon (doesn't work for me, as I needed to be in Miami before even that flight takes off), rebook on future flight, or full refund. I chose the refund. They wouldn't rebook me on another airline, and didn't provide any other accommodations. Because Spirit took so long at the terminal and on the phone, there were no other flights going out that night. I am currently typing this on a JetBlue flight (the next morning). My sister also flew Spirit the day before (same flight, just 1 day prior). Hers was delayed, but it did eventually fly. Good luck if you choose this airline.",-1
2017-04-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cabo San Lucas to San Diego,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,airline was a nightmare,False," Cabo San Lucas to San Diego with Spirit. Before the flight even started this airline was a nightmare. I booked it because Expedia listed it as a cheap option, unknowingly so only because they didn't yet charge me for carry-on bags. $130 to get my own and my girlfriend's bags home, and then an extra $11 to just choose seats. On top of that, our short flight has now been delayed for 2 hours, possibly more. Compared to American Airlines which brought us here, this is a travesty and I wonder how they are even in business. Never again will they get my money, this is a horrible company.",-1
2017-04-29,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,4.0,,3.0,,,4.0,1.0,can't speak kindly of the airline,False,  Orlando to Newark. I never had to pay for a carry on nor a beverage on a plane but with Spirit Airlines I did. We paid a total of almost $200 extra just for luggage and on the flight back our seats were not together and we had to pay an extra $70. I would not have minded but I was traveling with a two year old and you would think the airline would look at that and put us together. I fly frequently and always was able to charge my phone onboard but there were no outlets. Multiple bathrooms was plus and a newer plane but other than that I can't speak kindly of the airline. I doubt I will be booking with Spirit in the future.,-1
2017-04-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DFW to SJU via FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this airline is a joke,False,"  Dallas Ft Worth to San Juan via Ft Lauderdale. The baggage check in is guaranteed to take over an hour, so be sure to arrive 3 hours early for your check, and to check or carry any bags you will have to pay a minimum of $30, though they will allow you to travel with a purse or laptop. For a water you'll be charged $3 so bring your own. If they mess up your flight, for whatever reason or you are willing to let a stand by guest take your place, they'll give you a free voucher - all you do is pay the government fees! But the government fees that show on line, for my $124 round trip from DFW to PHL went from $32 to $88 for the actual booking, and that was without the talk to a human booking fee of $25. This airline is a joke!",-1
2017-04-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlantic City to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,over-double the time to get home,False," The trip from Atlantic City to Tampa was uneventful; it was the first time I had flown Spirit, and despite the rather small seats, the flight was OK. On the day of my return trip, I received an e-mail explaining that my flight had been cancelled, with no reason given. Upon calling the number for customer service, I was told that the only flight available to return to NJ was 5 days later. The only other option was a partial refund of my round-trip ticket which would cover my return flight. That's it. Nothing for extended hotel or rental car fees, and there was nothing mentioned about a return trip on any other airline. I was left on my own to find a one-way flight home. Compounding the problem was the fact that I had parked my car in Atlantic City, and I had to fly into Philly. Long story short; my return trip was Tampa to Detroit to Philadelphia to Atlantic City airport (by $85 Uber) to pick up my car - a total of 10.5 hours to get home, which would have been a little over 3 hours had Spirit not cancelled. My Delta flight home was $255 plus $85 for the Uber ride, but my refund from Spirit was $114, so not only did Spirit cost me well over $200 in additional travel charges, it over-double the time to get home. Never again, thanks for nothing.",-1
2017-04-26,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Cleveland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,never fly Spirit Airline again,False,  Tampa to Cleveland. Spirit Airlines is one of the worst I have seen for customer service. We were scheduled to take off from Tampa at 3:15 pm. and before being picked up by a car service we doubled checked our flight and were told that it was on time. Upon arriving at the gate we were informed that our flight was delayed 2 hours. After waiting 90 minutes we were informed that the flight was cancelled. Now the good part starts. We were herded like cattle down to the ticket area and then herded again over to a remote area so that we were out of the way and wouldn't make a scene. The entire passenger list was standing in line and were being dealt with one at a time. This was a very long process and it could have been avoided if they would have announced that they were only giving refunds and no assistance to fly out on another flight. After standing in line for two hours they made that announcement and handed out cards with a number to call to get your refund. By this time there were no taxis available and we were stranded. The only thing left to do was call a car service and pay another $50 to get a ride back home. We are now out $100 for car service and Spirit could care less. I phoned for my refund and was told that it would arrive on my credit card in 7 to 10 days or at least that was what I thought I was told. 10 days passed and no refund. I called again and got another agent that was a little better to understand but not by much. He informed me that my refund was never applied for and that he would process it for me now. Finally it hit my account. Why can't these companies pay Americans to do their customer service work. Waiting to book another flight and try to get a reasonable price on a short notice is frustrating enough and then to put up with people that you can't understand adds to the tipping point where you want to choke someone. I will never fly Spirit Airline again because I believe that they have no consideration for their customers and the hardship of having their travel arrangements disrupted.,-1
2017-04-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,feel ripped off and jipped,False,"  Denver to Phoenix. This has been the worst travel experience. Spirit Airlines is nothing but a scam. Less, how about double what my other flight was by the time you pay their fees. Which I may add they don't broadcast or indicate when you book. Seats are small, if you are over 6ft talk I feel bad for you. Worst customer service, or lack there of.  I would have rather thrown money out the window then to ever book a flight with this airline again. If I could give a negative rating I would. Overall, feel ripped off and jipped. Spirit Airlines should be ashamed to consider yourself a real airline.",-1

My flight was delayed to 1pm and didn't receive and email saying this until 7am. Ok. Terrible but I can deal with it, then at 10am we receive an email saying our flight time is 5.30pm. They gave me and my girlfriend each a 7 dollar food voucher! Would never use this airline again, don't waste your time. The whole staff had no clue how to handle the situation and no-one was helpful. Everyone at the airport that we talked to joked that this kind of thing always happens with spirit. Stay away people!",-1
2017-04-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Philadelphia,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never flying them again,False,  Orlando to Philadelphia. Spirit Airlines sent an email the night before saying I should arrive 3 hours early. Got to the counter to find my flight had been delayed by 5 hours. Spirit had sent the notification email two hours before departure. My flight has either been delayed or moved up without warning 3 out of the 4 times I've flown them. The planes are uncomfortable and my time is worth more than the small amount of money saved by using this airline. Never flying them again.,-1
2017-04-24,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Oakland via Los Angeles,3.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,a very awesome experience,False,"  Baltimore to Oakland via Los Angeles. I had a very awesome experience flying with Spirit with my family, 2 adults and 2 toddlers. I was skeptical at first but since we were on a budget and would like to bring kids out to west coast so we decided to give it a try. Since we paid $370 for four of us from Baltimore to Oakland so we didn't expect anything fancy but they exceeded our expectations. Their website is clear and let us know what could add up and would be more charged but we still had option to go without paying more. They make it clear about check in and carry on bags fee, they always send reminders to let us know about size of free bag and time/gate changes. They surprised me by noticing me that I could check stroller and car seats for free and when we were boarding, they let family with young kids go first which I appreciate that too, on top of free personal items we were allowed to bring a diaper/food bag in for free too. The seats were good size with good leg room. I did not feel it too different from JetBlue, United or AA that I had experience with. All of my flights were on time and got to destinations early. Crews were friendly and helpful to us.",1
2017-04-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,most stressful and unpleasant experience,False,"  Spirit Airlines is the worst airline I have flown and I travel often. Not only was my flight from Fort Lauderdale to Newark delayed but I had a very unpleasant experience from check in until I reached my gate. Not only did I have to pay $55 for my carry on bag that I had no problem with to my destination but then they wanted me to pay for my personal item as well. It's is ridiculous how one does not get to bring a carry on item for free. My flight was delayed and I walked all over the airport looking for customer service to put me on an earlier flight and I couldn't even do that because I was not able to find anyone who could help me. After walking 20 minutes to one gate I was pointed to customer service which was another 15 minute walk and to go there and no one is there. Also, you have to pay for water on the plane because nothing is free. This is the most stressful and unpleasant experience I have ever had with an airline. You are better off paying more money for a different airline than Spirit. I will never fly this airline again even if it means saving money.",-1
2017-04-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Cancun via Myrtle Beach,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,price was not a value,False,"  Boston to Cancun via Myrtle Beach and Ft Lauderdale. I bought this ticket because it offer a one stop to Cancun from Boston and back at a competitive price. After the fact they added a stop which would have meant I would have picked someone else had I known they would do that. The more I found out about them the less I liked them. At one point it seemed that one of our party may not be able to come, in the end they did, but their policy on this is so brutal it is almost that you would lose all you money. You get a credit you need to use in 90 days. Any booked airfare in that short a notice will be brutal. The fees are excessive. There is a fee for picking your seat, there is a fee if your 1 bag on an international flight exceeds 40 lbs. They do not provide water in flight without you having to pay for it. The unprofessionalness of the crew staff on our return flight from was epic. Everything was a joke. The announcements were a joke, they did not take their role seriously. We paid $30 per seat extra to ""pick our seats"" so we could sit together. On the last leg of the flight they asked my 14 year old to move his seat so a family could sit together (free). He was sitting with his friend that we brought with us, and my wife and I were elsewhere on the plane. Sure he could have said no, but he is 14 and said yes. Now we paid for something that Spirit gave away of ours for free. Seats were tiny, once fees and changes came into it price was not a value and the staff were unprofessional. Bottom line, for a quick hop and a short trip maybe this airline can make sense, but if you are going on a real vacation (distance and duration in days) stay away.",-1
2017-04-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,customer service reps were rude,False,"  Not only did Spirit Airlines cancel my flight less than 2 hours before it was supposed to depart (so I was already at the airport waiting in line for security), there was never a delay, they simply canceled it due to ""crew reasons"". They cost me and my boyfriend almost $400 due to the cancelation, because we weren't able to make our hotel and car rental reservations as well as the excursions we had planned for the next day. Spirit also now makes you pay for your baggage going and coming ($45 + for each bag, for each leg of your trip costing us an additional $340 total for our 4 carry-on bags). Not only were they extremely inconsiderate about the inconvenience they caused due to the cancelation, they still made us pay for our bags. The woman who ""assisted"" us at the counter issued both my boyfriend and I travel vouchers, and explained that those can be used to cover the cost of the bags. As I checked in that night for the new flight for the previous morning, I was then made aware that I would not in fact, be able to use those vouchers for the bags, only for in-flight purchases only. I then called the customer service line to have this issue resolved since I was told I could use the vouchers for our bags. When I finally got through to a customer service agent, they simply told me that the woman at the counter was ""mis-informed"" and I would still be paying for my bags. Overall horrible experience. Customer service reps were rude, and staff at the ticketing counter are ""mis-informed"" and just not helpful at all.",-1
2017-04-16,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,not worth whatever you save,False," Baltimore to Ft Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines. Completely incompetent staff. Boarding in BWI was a congested nightmare taking 2.5 hours; I barely made the flight. Staff rude and abrupt. There was no evident reason for delays; lines down the concourse and out the doors. Seats are flimsy and unforgiving. On board, attendants ignored requests for drinks for our child. I'm returning from Ft Lauderdale. Again, long lines and a single person checking bags while other staff wander around ""supervising"". Flight loading and no surprise - overbooked. Not worth whatever you save flying on this circus.",-1
2017-04-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,reward program is a sham,False,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas. In January 2016 we were searching for flights to Las Vegas. Spirit had the cheapest so we decided to book with them. We were offered the Spirit MasterCard and promised enough miles for 3 free round trip flights. I assumed off peak so no surprise there. Our trip to vegas was in June 2016 and about a week before our trip, an agent called me and told me they were downgrading our airplane and if we would volunteer to take a different flight the day before, we would get three comp tickets. (There were three in our party). Any time I would be able to use these tickets would most likely always fall in the peak seasons. I specifically asked the rep what the restrictions were for using these tickets and specifically asked for blackout dates. He assured me that because these were comp tickets for inconveniencing us, there were no black out date. I was told that we had to book within a certain time but could travel wherever Spirit flew anytime we got the ticket for. We agreed, flew in to Vegas a day early paying an extra night for a hotel but thought it was worth the three free tickets. When we got back, I called and tried to redeem the tickets and was told that A. There were blackout dates, B. We could NOT fly anywhere, and C. We would be charged $40 each way per ticket to use out ""free vouchers"". We were so mad we didn't use them. Now it's April 2017. I have 50,000 miles from my Spirit MC. I want to book a flight from Atlanta to Orlando (a zone 1 on their mileage chart) from April 26-30 (both dates are off peak own their mileage chart). The flight there costs 2,500 miles as it should according to their own chart. The return flight costs 25,000 miles! Same zone, off peak date as stated by them. Plus there is a $40 each wayfee per ticket to use the miles! I can get a Frontier flight for the hour trip from Atlanta to Orlando for $35 each way, $10 cheaper than using my free miles! Spirit's mileage reward program is a sham. The airline is as low class as you can get and still trust them to fly you across the sky. I am closing my MC and will NEVER even attempt to fly them again. There's no point in using the card if you get any benefits from it. If you want to add any kind of bag it ends up costing you the same as Delta anyway. I elected to use my real name in this review because I hope Spirit sees it and knows they lost a real customer.",-1
2017-04-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Bogota via Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,horrendous nightmare,False," Dallas to Bogota via Fort Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines. This is by far the worst experience I have had with an airline. The day of my departure, my flight got delayed, which caused me to miss my connecting flight from Fort Lauderdale. I ended up having to fly to Medellin in order to get to Colombia on that day. I then had to pay for a connecting flight form Medellin to Bogota. But that is only the beginning of this horrendous nightmare. The day of my return, I was informed that the my flight was oversold and was asked to give up my spot on the plane to which I said no, since I had to be in Dallas on that day. Not surprisingly, my flight got delayed and I missed my connecting flight from FLL to Dallas. When I got to the Spirit counter I realized that I was not the only with that problem; there were about 200 people who had missed their flights. Spirit did not offer any kind of effort to ease up the situation with their customers. They had us sleep at the airport and denied any refunds for the missed flights. Please avoid this scam.",-1
2017-04-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,it is not worth the stress,False,"  Spirit airline is horrendous. This is my 4th and last time flying through this airline from Orlando to Detroit. Every single time I fly with them I regret it. My flight is always cancelled or delayed, they have lost my luggage and sent it to Boston. Today was my deal breaker with this airline. They gave me a ticket that wouldn't scan so after waiting in line for security I come to find my ticket wouldn't scan. Then after going to the front desk the employee gave me a hard time about the situation causing me to miss my flight. After waiting airport for 5 hours from my ""delayed flight"", now I have to wait 4 and a half more hours for a new flight. I don't care how cheap they are it is not worth the stress. I've never in my life wrote a review. That's how much I dislike Spirit airline.",-1
2017-04-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Plattsburgh to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,total nightmare from the start,False,"  Flying with Spirit has been a total nightmare from the start. We were leaving Plattsburgh to Fort Lauderdale. Never made it to Fort Lauderdale because of fog (I totally understand this is none of their fault). We landed in Orlando, but didn't get any explanation of why. We had to wait for 2 hours at the Spirit counter before being instructed there would be bus accomodation to bring us to Fort Lauderdale. After waiting another 2h, we've been told that only 55 people could get on that bus and another one might arrive about an hour later. We decided to rent a car at our own charge since we were in Fort Lauderdale only for a couple days and couldn't afford to lose more time. When we left Fort Lauderdale, the flight attendant announced the flight was overbooked and they were asking for volunteers to catch a flight later. We have been offered a total of 4 free round-trip vouchers to anywhere Spirit flies. The flight attendant at the counter told us (and we signed for!) flights within US would be totally free and for flights outside US, we would only have to pay for airport tax. We decided to volunteer but when the time came to use those vouchers I spent hours on the phone with the company to find an available flight (we had multiple choices and flexible for the dates) and we were told that finally only bare fares were covered by the vouchers and even in US we would have to pay for all the other charges. We will never use Spirit again since it definitely doesn't worth saving a few bucks for that kind of headache!",-1
2017-04-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,do not make the mistake or be fooled,False,"  Flew from Boston to Las Vegas. Do not be fooled - there is absolutely nothing worth your while by flying Spirit Airlines. My vacation was completely soured by this airline. Most uncomfortable, narrow seats, water is even at a charge, and there was only 1 functional bathroom for a 5.5 hour, completely full flight, not to mention the fact that I pre-paid $40 for a checked bag, and was charged an additional $55 for a bag that was 51 pounds, yes you read that correctly $95 for a suitcase - an absolute scam. Staff are unhelpful, unfriendly, and find humor in how unaccommodating the airline is, joking and making reference to this the entire flight. Making the experience even more frustrating. Do not make the mistake or be fooled by the ""barefare"" advertisement!",-1
2017-04-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,we all feared missing our flights,False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta. By far the worst airline. First off, they advertise low fares, but charge you to print your boarding pass, pick your seat, carry on, and $100 if you check you bag in at the airport. The charge for beverages and have horrible snacks. Going to Florida, my flight was delayed and coming back it was delayed twice and the gate was changed 3 times. We had to stand in line to check in our bags for over 1 hour due to them not having enough staff, so we all feared missing our flights. I will never fly Spirit again.",-1
2017-04-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,bait-and-switch scandal,False,"  Bait and Switch Scandal. I took Spirit Airlines from Los Angeles to Houston because their published fare was $100 lower than their competition. After I had booked, I discovered that I had to pay almost $100 extra for my carry-on small suitcase. I did not have any checked baggage. I felt like I had been a victim of a bait-and-switch scandal. Passengers should not have to read the fine print of every airline when comparing ticket prices online. Everybody knows the partial cost of a trip is useless. An airline that will not publish the total cost for the average traveler is cheating when other airlines do. Shame on Spirit for such low-handed schemes.",-1
2017-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St.Thomas to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,one of the worst airlines,False,"  
Spirit Airlines is one of the worst airlines. The customer service is deplorable. I was travelling with my 6 year old and after arriving at St. Thomas airport, I was told my current flight was delayed and my connecting flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Baltimore would depart before we arrived. The agent went on to say: we would have to find a hotel in Fort Lauderdale at my expense. I was rebooked on the first flight the next morning. One of the agents accidentally said the delay was due to a maintenance issue. On my return trip? I got an email from Spirit, the night before departure, informing me that my flight for the next day was cancelled. They sent me a $50 voucher to redeem in less than a month and told me to reschedule my flight. I called in to the spirit office and explained it was very important for me to be booked on the next flight out and they basically said, they had no flights, we can refund you and find another airline. The other airline is now double the refund amount. This is the type of service you get when you fly with Spirit.",-1
2017-04-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to New Orleans via Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled due to crew availability,False," Oakland to New Orleans via Las Vegas with Spirit. Flight was cancelled due to crew availability. I received an email at 2am regarding my 6am flight informing me it was cancelled. There was no flight until the next day (this was a weekend trip, I would have been in N.O. for less than 24 hours if I took this). They refused to book me on another airline. Originally they only offered me a travel voucher on Spirit for completely ruining my trip at the very last second. Eventually they offered me a full refund, (they then sent me a $50 voucher in addition, fat chance I give them any money going forward). Unbelievably absurd to wake up at 4am to find out the airline couldn't get it together enough to find crew for the flight (looks like this is a reoccurring problem).",-1
2017-04-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never fly with Spirit again,False," I had a very bad experience the first time going with Spirit Airlines. I bought a ticket from a month ago flying from Philadelphia to Los Angeles to attend a conference on April 8. My flight was this Friday morning (April 7) at 7am. I checked in yesterday and woke up this early morning at 4am, I drove to the airport and parked my car. Everything seemed to be normal except when I arrived at the gate and found out the flight was cancelled. When I checked in yesterday, I input my email address and my cellphone number. I got two emails confirming my checking in and registration. But nobody sent me any notification this morning. All is this cancellation notice I saw on the desk when I arrived at the gate. I was a little bit panic, but there was nobody to help. I had to exit and went out to the front desk of ticketing. I asked the lady in the front desk and I also called Spirit Airlines customer phone number, they gave me two options: either they rearrange my trip on April 10 (which does not work because of my conference is on April 9), or get a refund for my ticket. They do not want to cover anything else such as my hotel cancellation fee, conference registration fee, parking, etc. I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again.",-1
2017-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlantic City to Fort Meyers,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled due to crew availability,False," Atlantic City to Fort Meyers. Will never, ever fly Spirit Airlines again. Cancelled our flight today due to ""crew availability"". Flight was scheduled to depart at 6:45 a.m. Received email notification of cancellation around 12:45 am. No answer at phone # provided in email for details and Atlantic City Airport showed flight ""On Time"". So we headed out at 4 am for the 40 minute drive. Got on the back of an already long line to hear from others that there were no Spirit flights w/ seating avail. until late next week and they were only offering refunds. There was no management personnel making themselves available for questioning. My 15-year-old son went online and found FFA rule 240 which mandates that ""an airline with a delayed or cancelled flight has to transfer passengers to another carrier if the second carrier could get passengers to the destination more quickly than the original airline."" We brought this to the attention of everyone around us and to employees at the ticket desk. To my knowledge, prior to this they were only offering refunds but then a supervisor started searching for available flights but explained she's limited only to flights that their system makes available to offer. In the end, we wound up with a flight w/ another carrier from Philadelphia to Miami arriving late Sunday evening, 3 days of vacation (which we rarely take) for my kids and I has been lost; time my husband unnecessarily missed from work driving us; my parents awaiting us in FL now having a much longer drive to/from airport. Others around us had pre-paid private condo rentals, vacation packages, etc at stake. I heard from a friend that United made similar cancellations today out of Newark. I'm hoping our flight on Sunday doesn't cancel as well.",-1
2017-04-07,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,willing to fly Spirit again,False,"  Seattle to Los Angeles. My friend said her experience with Spirit was that it was safe and cheap, like flying a bus! I found her description to be accurate. Planning ahead is the key to saving money. A checked bag is affordable if you purchase when you book, but not at the gate. I can bring my own snacks and buy a soda at the gift shop. Our flight from Seattle to LAX was delayed an hour, but I wasn't notified until we checked in. Our flight home left on time and arrived 20 minutes early. The staff were helpful, and the lead flight attendant on the way back was hilarious. We did ""flight yoga"" stretches that ended with picking up any trash lying around. She ended with ""it stung a bit when Forbes rated us last in customer service, but we hope we made your flight a pleasant experience today"" The low price allowed me to spring my family out of rainy Seattle for a week in the California sun. I'd be willing to fly Spirit again.",1
2017-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,refused to book us on another airline,False,"  We had a direct flight from Minneapolis to Orlando. The weather was fine. Our flight was cancelled due to crew availability. Customer service refused to book us on another airline. The only other flight out via Spirit was at night, and already booked. The red-eye flight the next morning, also booked. We're now stuck with a red-eye flight with a long layover in Chicago. Two days of our four day vacation are gone. Wish we'd never even schedule this trip. We will never ever fly Spirit again.",-1
2017-04-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Seattle,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,it made fools out of us,False,"  We flew this airline for the first time on April fool's day 4/01/2017, and it made fools out of us. Flew from Los Angeles to Seattle. We tried saving $10 by doing the online check in for a luggage because it cost $50 at the counter. At the counter, we were told our luggage was 9 lbs over (49 lbs), and it would cost us an additional $30, so now our 1 piece of luggage cost us $70. I thought the standard allowable weight for luggage is 50lbs, but for Spirit Airline it is 40lbs. We get to the gate and watch Spirit rip off its customers for more money. We watch them charge a girl $100 for not cheking in her carry on earlier. We sat next to a girl with a 25lbs smelly dog on her lap. Since when did airline started to allow pets on the airplane? There's no free water on the airplane. A 16 ounce water bottle cost $3. The flight attendant crews are rude. The flight crew left the plane first, so I didnt get to tell the Captain and his First Officer how horrible their airline was. Won't get fooled again.",-1
2017-04-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Detroit,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,had no crew to fly the plane,False,  Myrtle Beach to Detroit. Found out flight was delayed by display screen. Spirit never said a word. Asked the attendant at counter why. She told me they had no crew to fly the plane! How can you sell a ticket and not have a crew to fly the plane? Then got a delay email after the plane should have been in the air! Arrived 2hrs late then waited 35 minutes to get a bag. So it ended up costing me an extra day to car parking fee. Got in after midnight and after drive home missed half a day of work! That cost me even more money! All because they cant staff a plane they sold tickets for!,-1
2017-04-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1.0,horrible first experience,False,"  Seattle to Las Vegas. This was our first time using Spirit Airlines and even though we were skeptical we decided to give it a try. I printed boarding passes and checked in the night before. We were suppose to board at 5:15am and got notified at 4:18am by the airline that our flight was cancelled. Customer service in the airport was a joke, they couldnt provide any information as to why the flight was cancelled - they first said it was due to high winds, then another lady said it was coming from the east coast. All the while we were left stranded and all the staff would say was you can try a different airline - but could not help direct us to an airline leaving same day or even try to help get us on a different flight until tuesday (4.5) days later. Obviously time was already taken off work and the trip could not be put off until then and they didnt offer to help with hotel or anything - all they offered was a refund which would not be applied to the bank 3-5 days later. Overall horrible first experience and we didnt even make it on our flight nor will we ever fly Spirit Airlines again.",-1
2017-04-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,employees horrendous and rude,False, Los Angeles to Oakland with Spirit Airlines. Flight was delayed. Found out from the screen. Fair enough. Flight delayed again. Found out from the screen. Slightly annoyed. Flight delayed again. Found out from employee laughing as he is sharing the news. We get on the plane. Told we are about to take off. Fifteen minutes later we are told it will be another ten minutes. Their employees are horrendous and rude. Their $55 fee for a carry on bag is ludicrous. I won't fly with this airline ever again. They're terrible!,-1
2017-04-03,0.8,Business,Economy Class,New York to Dallas via Orlando,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,cheap way of getting about,False," New York to Dallas via Orlando. Had to make a couple of short trips internally in the US and found Spirit to be the most effective for scheduling. Had heard nothing about this airline save that the reviews about it were not kind. The reality is perhaps a bit different. Newark to Orlando was delayed by two hours but not fault of the airline. Bad weather. Uneventful flight. Orlando to Dallas was similar but on time. In both cases the airline charged for excess baggage which I knew about and also seat assignment. Typical of all LLC carriers. If you need to go from point A to B and bring your own snacks, then it's a cheap way of getting about the US. Don't expect AA standards and you won't be disappointed.",1
2017-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Phoenix,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,rebook only on their airline,False," Chicago to Phoenix with Spirit Airlines. Should have known better. Price was good, we knew all the extra charges they would do and were prepared. Got to airport (3 hours from home) and told flight was cancelled as we tried to check bags. Said they would ""rebook only on their airline"" the next day and would give us hotel. Problem was we had a non-refundable hotel and water park in Phoenix. Asked ticket counter manager for another airline today, not tomorrow. Answer: ""We will rebook only on our airline"". Mentioned the cost to me. Answer: ""we will rebook only on our airline"". Asked about refund now. Answer: ""no problem, we will rebook only on our airline"". So we asked the helpful clerk about refund and he said we could just do refund for today and fly back in Spirit on the return trip. Sounded fine, but guess what - then no hotel. So we took the full refund and booked a flight on United for $40 more each round trip. Don't do the cheap. It's not worth it. I have flown hundreds of thousands of miles and never had an airline not try to rebook on others. My guess is they can't because the other airlines won't deal with them and I won't either.",-1
2017-03-30,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Myers,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,it works for me,False,"  Boston to Fort Myers. Spirit is what it is! I hear a lot of complaints but if you know how to pack light, you don't care where you sit, bring your own empty water bottle (to fill once you get past security), bring your own bagel, sandwich, chips, cookies, nips etc) you can fly pretty darn cheap. For me it's just spending as little as possible to get from point A to point B and being able to go more often. I fly spirit and jet blue - most of the time they are on time and equally affected by weather they cannot predict or control. Read the fine print (it's quite bold and kinda funny). The staff has always been kind (and trust me, they put up with a lot of people who obviously don't read) and recently refunded me the seat selection cost on a flight my husband could not make (he cares where he sits). It's not for everyone, but it works for me!",1
2017-03-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Detroit to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,email saying the flight had been cancelled,False,"  Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. We booked our flight with Spirit in January to fly to Ft. Lauderdale for our honeymoon cruise. They had the best rate for the very specific times we needed in order to make the cruise ship in time and that accommodated the time we needed to return. At the time of booking we didn't know they kept their ticket prices low by charging insane amounts for everything else. We woke up at 02:00 and got to the airport in plenty of time to get through check in and security. We had paid $608 for 2 tickets from Detroit to Ft. Lauderdale. We paid an additional $328 in baggage fees during online check in. (Pay for your bags, checked bags cost less than carry on bags for some reason, pay to pick our seats because they say that you won't end up next to your traveling companions unless you pay for specific seats) And then an additional $30 for an overweight bag at the airport. We were through security and waiting at the gate for our flight to take off so we could start our honeymoon. Less than 30 minutes before we were supposed to take off I received an email saying the flight had been cancelled. The Flight board still said 'on time', and there was no Spirit employee to help at the gate. A few other people got the email as well, and then we finally had to go and find someone and it was after we were supposed to have taken off that we were informed it was actually cancelled and directed to an open area in the airport along with 2 other Spirit flights that were cancelled. Every one of the Spirit employees I spoke with were rude. I was offered the next flight out at 15:00 (my original flight was due to leave at 06:45 and land in Ft Lauderdale at 09:45 giving me plenty of time to check in to the cruise ship by the 15:00 deadline) The offer of the flight leaving at 15:00 was of no use to me and inadequate. Eventually after repeating herself 15 times, taking up about 45 minutes of our time and delaying people that had to leave by a certain time, the Spirit employee gave out cards with the phone number for the refund and I ran upstairs to wait in line to see if I could get replacement tickets to get me to my destination on time. I called 4 other airlines, and waited in 3 lines at the airport before finally finding one that had tickets available and could get me to my destination. When I called customer service for my refund I was offered additional 'compensation' of 2 x $50 vouchers for a future Spirit flight, when I later complained to customer service and the refund people that I had to pay an additional $883.24 (in addition to the $966.76 I already paid to their airline) to get tickets on another airline to get down to my destination in time, they bumped it up to 2 x $100 vouchers to fly on their airline again. (Which with how this has been handled, and how I've been treated will never happen). My flight was cancelled because the pilot was unavailable, we were told the pilot was ""sick"". 3 Spirit flights were cancelled that morning at 1 airport because of ""sick"" pilots. I am just curious as to who at Spirit actually does their job?",-1

Worst airline ever, they cancelled our flight with no notice at the airport. It's not until we noticed that the time had passed for us to board and their were no flight attendants or boarding people. Women handling the vouchers were extremely rude. I would not recommend people to use this airline you will never get to your destination. That's what going inexpensive gets you I guess.",-1

Sat in TPA airport 7 hours delayed after delay until finally cancelled. Best option offered was to try again Monday - nothing Saturday/Sunday! They had several cancellations on Saturday and I know it was not weather related. I guess their fleet must have been having mechanical issues?  Cost us for expensive non-refundable Hotels in Boston, Expensive Meals in Boston. Forget the cost of their ticket. If they fail to get you to your destination, they are a liability.

They delayed my flight from Dallas TX to Philadelphia PA for over five hours. There were no weather problems or mechanical problems, they simply said their crew had not arrived.

Our flight out of Cuba was delayed and we missed our connecting flight. I completely understand that operational problems occur but how they responded was beyond pathetic. They decided to transport my family to Tampa on a shuttle van with 10 other people for a flight that will leave the next day at 3.00 pm. to Chicago. Mind you, Chicago is in a snow storm and multiple flights have been delayed already. There, we are scheduled for a 4 hour layover before getting on our final flight to Phoenix. An agent said the same problem happened the day before and usually happens multiple times per week. This was verified with another representative for Spirit along with our shuttle driver. Do not take any flight with this airline. There is absolutely no savings. This is my second trip with them and the first trip was slightly better but not by much. I thought that I was just unlucky but it appears to be typical. You have been warned!",-1
2017-03-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Boston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,Customer service cracked under pressure,False,"  Tampa to Boston. We began getting flight delayed notifications at 10:36 the morning of the flight. They had delayed the flight 2 hours (mechanical issues), but required us to arrive at the designated time ""just in Case"". Before we left the house we received another notification it had been delayed further, and then in route again. By the time we reached the airport, our 3:23pm flight was now an 8:30pm flight. Then at 4:30, it was moved to 10:00pm which 20 minutes later, it was cancelled. Then the fun began. 100 Boston strong passengers all trying to get booked on other flights, get hotels for a next day flight or just scrambling for some sense of satisfaction. I then noticed on the flight board 8 or the 10 flights scheduled were cancelled or delayed beyond 4-6 hours for ""mechanical issues"" - really 8 of 10. I can accept the ""meat in a seat"" mentality and no frills once on board, (you get what you pay for). But keeping your planes in the air?  Customer service did the best they could but in the end surrendered to the masses and cracked under pressure, they lost their composure and fell back on policy (which by the way is the ""be all catch all"" of CYA for any business, it has no place in customer service since it has no intention of providing a customer service). In the end I asked for a refund and used points to grab a United flight the next morning. I used my own points for a nicer hotel and refused their $7 meal voucher. Saving money and being the cheapest airline is far different than being the ""least expensive"".  There has to be a minimum standard.",-1
2017-03-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,disgraceful and embarrassing,False," Atlanta to Tampa, my friends and I spent 12+ hours in the airport due to Spirit Airlines. We managed to catch a ride from Clemson, which is 2 hours away from Atlanta, and then waited at the gate while there were 5 different delays that took place. The flight went from taking off at 1, all the way to taking off at 9 until they finally cancelled it. We had no way to get back to Clemson and nowhere to stay. The customer service representatives and desk people were not accommodating and gave us all attitudes when we just needed to know where to go. We talked to 5 different people and they all told us to go somewhere different. They did not compensate for our lost flight, only by giving us a refund which was rightly deserved. They didn't offer to book us on another airline. All in all, I will never be flying Spirit again. Yes, it is cheaper, but it will just make you spend even more money than the original, more expensive flight was. Even when I called their customer service number, they weren't nice or apologetic. It also took almost 20 minutes to get on the phone with someone. This kind of service is disgraceful and embarrassing.",-1

After waiting in line for flight reassignments, Customers began to argue and the rest of us were sent to the front ticket counter for flight reassignments. I was issued 2 x $50 travel vouchers and told to use them within 3-months. I tried to book them today online and they show expired.

March 16, Houston to Orlando was the worst trip I ever did. I do not recommend to anyone, to fly with Spirit airline, the chair is uncomfortable, it does not recline. The crew is not prepared to receive, politely with the customers, the on board service is poor for the amount that is charged for tickets. I will not fly again for this company.",-1
2017-03-17,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,3.0,5.0,money you save may offset negatives,False,"  Spirit Air came in at $74.00  round-trip for a last-minute trip from San Diego to Las Vegas - assuming practically luggage-less, without stretching my legs or reclining, not consuming food or beverage. There are additional charges, though you could hardly call them hidden. If you fly Spirit Air, be sure of the sacrifices you will make, the possible inconveniences you could experience and the totality of what you are getting for your money. Included in your airfare is 1 carry-on item no larger than a small gym bag. Additional carry-ons and each piece of standard size/weight baggage must be paid for. Make your baggage reservations and pay the associated fee(s) online, when you buy your ticket. The per-bag fee can reach $100/each if you wait until check-in to deal with your luggage. Get your seat assignment then, too. You'll get charged a nominal boarding pass fee if you don't. Overcoats, purses, and laptop bags are considered single carry-on items. If you are taller/larger than average or pregnant, you will be extremely uncomfortable in economy class seating. There is little legroom, the seats are pretty close together and do not recline. There is no wi-fi, cellphone coverage, or inflight entertainment. Using Sprint Air to connect with a flight on another carrier is quite risky! If your Sprint Air flight is cancelled, or you miss a Sprint Air connecting flight you are screwed on many levels. Do not make alternative plans without knowing your entitlements. Everything you can demand will not likely be offered. If your flight is nonstop & under 4 hours, the money you save may offset the negatives. Especially if you don't have the luxury of advanced booking time or flexibility with travel dates 'cuz that's where larger carriers will gouge you. Investigate upgrading your seating class, plan ahead and look into their member club for additional savings and a more comfortable experience. Spirit Air has the cheapest 11th hour airfares and if unplanned or unbudgeted travel becomes necessary, the financial impact of that situation will be exponentially less.",1
2017-03-15,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Myrtle Beach,3.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,We had a great experience,False,"  Philadelphia to Myrtle Beach. I have read a lot of reviews and was concerned about utilizing Spirit Airlines however, I have to give them their Props! On March 14, 2017 when many of the major carriers cancelled their flights (due to a Nor'easter that ended up a dud) into Philadelphia, Spirit Airlines kept their flight on schedule and we were able to get into Philly when most carriers chose not to fly to Philly! Thank you Spirit! Please remember everyone, they are serious about the Bare Fare and they tell you all up front on their website and reservation information Exactly what you will get. Careful planning on your part will reduce a surprise later in your travel process. It is True the seats dont recline, there is No WIFI and you have to pay for any type of drink if you want it, also they do have very explicit baggage policies. However, their prices for airfare on a quick trip is something you cant beat! We had a great experience and will be happy to fly again with Spirit Airlines.",1
2017-03-15,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Phoenix,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,a good price on a flight,False,"  Houston to Phoenix. If you are looking for a good price on a flight less than 4 hours, and can live with the tight leg space for a short time, Spirit is your airline. I have flown roughly 20 short trips with them and never had a cancellation or delay. Don't complain about the baggage price, because it clearly list the prices when you are booking. $35 a bag is not terrible when your flight is $38.00. Yes, from Houston to Phoenix, round trip plus luggage- $146.",1
2017-03-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Detroit,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,delay leaving New Orleans,False,"  There was a delay leaving New Orleans and no one at the counter could give an estimate of how long, even though the plane that was to pick us up was in the air. The delay was short and the pilot advised us that we had a tailwind and should be able to make up the lost time. We arrived 10 minutes late, not too bad. We sat on the tarmac for approximately one hour without an explanation. We get to the gate and are advised that our luggage would be on carousel #2. There were six other flights on carousel #2. Some came in after and their luggage came out first. I went to the Spirit baggage center and they stated that they had no idea when they would come up or what order. I went back twenty minutes later and they were put off that there were still questions. They were quite rude and stated that Wayne County was in charge of where bags went and what order. I left the office quite mad and saw that #3 carousel was working and bags were coming out. I spotted my bag and took it. I went back to the office to inform the office where the bags from New Orleans were so they could make an announcement and they stated that can't be and never made an announcement. This does not even cover the flight that my daughter took to meet us in New Orleans. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! We were in the airport after landing well over 2 hours.",-1
2017-03-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Aruba,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never once being updated by airline personnel,False,  Will never fly or recommend Spirit Airlines to anyone. Flew on 3/18/17 to Aruba via Fort Lauderdale. Flight #103 and #885. We encountered several delays - never once being updated by airline personnel of what was going on. Same thing on the way home on 3/25 - flight #886 and #126. Can not believe you can't even get a cup of water for free. Seats do not recline. No wifi on any of flights we were on. Worst airline I have flown with.,-1
2017-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,you get what you pay for,False,"  Flew Spirit from San Diego to Chicago. You get what you pay for. I had a few problems along with the aforementioned baggage fees, minimal leg room, no reclining, no snacks/beverages, etc. Granted, I made a mistake that I felt were swiftly taken advantage of by Spirit, who seems to be out there to make quick buck. I forgot to print my boarding pass at home, so I used the self-check in booths. After two booths threw error messages at me, I proceeded to line up at the kiosk to print my pass, where the attendant told me to go back to use the self-check in, otherwise she informed they charge $10 to print your boarding pass. After arguing with her and telling her the self-check in booths weren't working, she finally waived the fee, not without warning me next time. I don't know which airline would charge 10 dollars to print a small piece of paper.",-1
2017-03-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Cancun,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1.0,do not recommend this airline,False,"  
Absolutely horrendous airline. Our flight was delayed 3 hours in Boston due to them needing to ""jumpstart"" the plane, missed our connecting flight also through Spirit to Cancun. They did not accommodate a flight for the same day, they made us stay overnight in a hotel missing our whole day at our all inclusive resort and gave us vouchers of $100. Then they gave us food vouchers that only worked at the restaurants in the airport so tell me how that makes up for the dinner and breakfast we needed to eat at the hotel. I'm worried for our flight home in fear we will miss our connecting again. I do not recommend this airline for anyone.",-1
2017-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,over 30 hours to get back home,False,"  My experience with Spirit Airlines was the worst that I have had with any airline. Between them changing my flights and all the delays, it took me over 30 hours to get back home to Atlanta from Las Vegas! They changed my return flight to travel from Las Vegas - Los Angeles - Ft Lauderdale - Atlanta. My children and I will never make this mistake again. I didn't even include all the problems I encountered with booking the flight. In the long run, I would have saved money and time booking with a more repritable company.",-1
2017-03-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Tampa to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,cancelled the flight,False,  Flew Spirit Airlines from Tampa to Detroit. Cancelled the flight 4 hours after it was to take off leaving a plane full of passengers stranded. They did not accommodate hotels cars or other flights. The only thing they said they would do is offer a flight two days later. This ended up costing $2000 for new flight hotel and rental car. Please do yourself a favor and never fly Spirit again.,-1
2017-03-12,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,be prepared for a canceled flight,False," Houston to Fort Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines. First flight. If you have a maintenance issue be prepared for a canceled flight. Not enough planes, not enough maintenance crew and after a 5 hour wait yes, you will be canceled. Tip: Never pre-pay for hotels or car rentals, Spirit will give you a voucher for what they think is fair and you will not make your destination on time. Value in this case turns out to be expensive. Whatever you have saved is not enough to cover the losses.",-1
2017-03-10,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Kansas City to Orlando,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,3.0,5.0,will fly with Spirit Airlines again,False,"  Kansas City to Orlando. I fly all the time for work and usually fly American. Did not want to deviate but this was last minute travel. On top of the fact it was last minute; I flew with my three boys. Normally this is a set up for disaster but it started our trip off right. Plane was clean, staff was gracious and the ride was smooth. I was very impressed and will fly with Spirit Airlines again.",1
2017-03-08,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Diego,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,courteous and professional,False,"  Las Vegas to San Diego. My second flight with Spirit Airlines. Staff courteous and professional. Still impressed with how quickly the boarding process occurs. As only 20% of passengers bring Roll A Boards on the aircraft the process is less than half the time of American or United which I flew on last week. Again, not certain why this company garners such negative reviews.",1
2017-03-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Medellin,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline I've tried,False,"  
Worst airline I've tried. Spirit Airlines cancelled my flight from Atlanta to Medellin 5 hours before departure. When I look for a solution at the deskfront, they told me they could give me another flight but 48 hours later. I asked for an urgent solution, and they told me te call to the call center. When I called, the only thing they told me was that they would only return the value of the one way ticket. They did not provide me with me any other solutions, and I had to pay 3 times the price for another flight, with a delay of 16 hours from the previous expected arrival. They did not returned the money that I payed for the additional baggage (USD 50 +tax).",-1
2017-03-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Chicago,1.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,my final flight with this airline,False,"  
Flew Spirit Airlines from San Diego to Chicago. For what you save in money you pay for in comfort and convenience. Seats have no padding on them and you are sitting on basically metal seats. The aches and pains start fast into the flight. When you land you'll often be greeted with another plane at your terminal causing a big delay or crashed computer systems. We have been sitting and waiting to pull in now for almost 2hrs. This will be my final flight with this airline. To those of you who read this I would spend the extra $100 so you can fly comfortably and conveniently.",-1
2017-03-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,2.0,will never fly them again,False,"  Chicago to Orlando. I have always heard that you get what you pay for, and hadn't ever considered Spirit, but a friend flies them frequently & has not had a problem, so I decided to try it. Big mistake! I live in Wisconsin, about 1/2 hour north of Milwaukee, but Spirit flies out of Chicago, so we got a hotel room for the night before our flight (because it was leaving at 6:40 a.m.). When we arrived at our hotel, I checked to be sure our flight was on time. This was when I found out our flight was cancelled & we were bumped to a flight 4 1/2 hours later. Absolutely no notification at all! We tried to verify via their web site, then called their customer service line. They couldn't even find our original flight & insisted it didn't exist, even though we were looking right at our confirmation! After at least 10 minutes, someone else finally got on the phone & said, yes, that was originally our flight, but the time was changed a couple times, then the flight got cancelled two weeks after we booked it. There were also two changes to the flight we were changed to, for a total of 5 flight changes. They say they notified us by email, but neither myself or the friend I was traveling with ever received any of those emails (and we're both very organized people). The really sad thing is, at 2:00 a.m. that night, Spirit finally sent an email to my friend saying our flight wouldn't arrive until 3 hours later than we had been told! Our entire first day at Disney would have been blown! Again, we couldn't verify this by their web site (it was never able to upload, even though every other web site worked), so we decided to go to the airport. No one there knew anything about an arrival time change, and our flight landed on time, so the one email we did get from Spirit was wrong! In the end, we ended up spending more because of paying for a hotel in Chicago that we didn't end up needing. Totally messed up experience. We will never fly them again. They only reason I gave them 1 star is because their seats are fairly comfortable & the crew was nice.",-1
2017-03-05,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Orlando,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,4.0,exceeded my extremely low expectations,False," Detroit to Orlando with Spirit Airlines. Overall, it exceeded my extremely low expectations. I knew what I was expecting when paying for bags, seating assignment etc as I read the fine print. I don't understand how people complain about paying for food and drink on the plane even though their policy is clear about this. Although I do think their charge for carry-on is outrageous ($35 for first one). As for the flight itself, we departed on time and arrived early. Gate agents seemed annoyed in general but I didn't have to interact with them. Flight attendants were really nice and had a good sense of humor. My only complaint was that during the second half of the flight, they tried to sell people their Spirit credit card and spent about 10-15 minutes talking about it over the intercom. Got really annoying and seemed tacky overall. Seats were comfortable for the first half but the inability to recline really bothered me. Overall, I was satisfied considering what I paid and what I expected and will fly with them again.",1
2017-03-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles,,,,,,1.0,1.0,experience has been surreal,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles via Chicago / Denver. My experience has been surreal so far and the flight isn't even until tomorrow. I saw an email saying that you are charged even for carry on bags but could be charged a little less if you checked in online, which already steamed me because I only chose this very inconvenient flight to save money in the first place. In order to check in online you have to make an account with spirit's website first (I used a 3rd party to initially purchase tickets).  But every time I would enter my info to register an account, it would tell me I had to be a passenger to register and I wasn't a passenger. Spent the next 2 hours simply trying to reach a human on the phone when trying to call any number I could find online. Finally found the secret path to reach an operator on one of those 'find a human' websites (call main number and press 4 at the first set of automated prompts, then 1 for the next set, then 5 then 7 then 3) Apparently, the name they had was spelled so messed up it's why I wasn't being recognized, yet my info in the confirmation email I received from the 3rd party I bought the ticket from was completely correct. The operator corrected my name and told me to try again but it still kept saying I was not a passenger every time I got to the last step of the registration process. This is where I really thought I was going to go crazy. Every time I explained to her that I was unable to make an account since I wasn't being recognized as a passenger, she would put me on hold for a few minutes then come back and say in a different way that in order for me to check in, I'd simply have to make an account first, it was as though she was a living version of the automated system. I would follow a new set of her instructions just to realize she was walking me through the process I had just attempted 500 times, too stuck in her 'what to say next' manual to understand that my very problem was the registration step itself. After 45 minutes of this, me almost in tears with frustration, she said that I could just check in for free at the airport and handle my carry on bag charge over the phone with her but there would be an additional $50 over the phone charge. She finally put me through to a supervisor who did charged me the regular online price of a carry on and could not provide me with a digital receipt or confirmation on this for the airport tomorrow. 3 hours this took.",-1
2017-02-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to PHL,3.0,,5.0,,,3.0,1.0,It is simply not worth it,False,"  Orlando to Philadelphia. As a new customer with Spirit, it was apparent to me that the airline does not have the capacity to efficiently handle when things go wrong. Normally, it's not a big deal when flights are cancelled or diverted because most other airlines have large fleets, multiple flights going out on the same day, partnerships with other airlines, etc. However, with Spirit that is not the case. When my flight to Ft. Lauderdale was diverted to Tampa, myself and many others were left stranded. We also sat on the plane for 2 hours before we were able to de-plane. Most other airlines allow the customer to reschedule flights online in the event of a cancellation; however, we were all forced to reschedule with an agent at a desk. This was an extremely inefficient process, as about 300 people from multiple diverted flights waited in line for hours to re-book their flights.This seemed unnecessary and it just added insult to injury. When it was finally my turn to speak with an agent, I was told that my only realistic option was to get a flight at a different airport the following morning. This wouldn't have been too much of an issue except I was offered no compensation for the cost of a rental car or hotel room, which is an estimated $150-200 additional expense incurred due to an incident that was no fault of my own. Given the additional expense, this eliminates any cost savings in choosing to fly with Spirit. In other words, it defeats the purpose of choosing Spirit over other airlines, who are well equipped for handling these types of scenarios. I was offered a $50 voucher from Spirit towards a future flight as compensation for the time and money wasted. I find this insulting, as it doesn't even cover the cost of transportation to the other airport. It also assumes that I will do business with Spirit again, which I have no intention of doing in the future. When I was about to board my flight home the following morning, we were told that boarding was delayed because the flight attendant was late. About an hour later, we were able to board. At that point the message was clear to me that flying with Spirit leaves much to be desired. It is simply not worth it.",-1
2017-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Never flying with them again,False,"  Cleveland to Los Angeles. Flight NK185 Flight was supposed to board at 4pm on 27 February. After waiting 2.5 hours for flight delay, we called to get a refund. A call that took 25 minutes and ended in - no we cannot give a refund until the flight is cancelled. During which time the flight staff communicated they had ""no idea what the problem was."" None of the digital displays were showing any updates for change in departed time. Our flight said it was on time after 4 hours of being delayed. 2 hours later after walking around and not being updated by the displays we get back to the gate to find out we had to exit and go back to ticketing to get a refund. No announcement had been made to the rest of the airport, even though announcements for individuals leaving a belt behind at Security had announcements. Then we waited for 3 hours in line with the rest of the flight to find out what to do because we were all stranded. Then a customer service rep for Spirit handed out cards that said to visit www.spirit.com/rebook, in order to skip the line, but that web address does not even exist. Then we finally reach customer service and they said they can't give a partial refund - my fiancé needed to get back and already booked a flight with Delta. I was hoping to save some money from the whopping 200 hundred plus upcharge for needing to book last minute, and rebook through Spirit. Unfortunately I had regrettable customer service from the attendants, who rolled their eyes and gave intense attitude. They said they couldn't refund one ticket and not another and get a hotel voucher. Never flying with them again. Most abhorrent excuse of a company.",-1
2017-02-28,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Las Vegas,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,pleasantly surprised with flight.,False,"  Houston to Las Vegas. We were leery about flying Spirit because of some past experiences. When we looked for airline tickets to Vegas they were the only direct flight and the best priced. Since we were not on a tight schedule, we decided to fly them again. I must say we were pleasantly surprised with this flight. Both ways were spot on for time. I felt everything was well organized unlike some past experiences. I am hopeful that the issues we had originally were just ""growing"" issues. We are looking for airfare to Cabo San Lucas so I will be hunting reviews to see how well they are doing there.",1

The first thing that sent a red flag was they changed our gate 3 times. They tell us we have to pay for a carry on. You have to pay for anything to drink. Then when we landed they told us which carousel our luggage would be on, and switched that 4 times, then told us to move to the side of baggage claim so they could get everyone's address/hotel info to deliver our luggage because it never left it's original place, that took 2 hours. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! In the long run it is more expensive and a huge hassle!",-1
2017-02-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,longest line to check in,False,  Ft Lauderdale to Newark. Longest line to check in. They had like 2 staff checking in hundreds of people. Thought we were there way too early but in reality we needed to be like like 5 hours early. A teenage could design a more efficient check in line. Avoid this airline like the plague. Not to mention they charge you for everything including printing your boarding passes. If you don't check in online it's $10 per person to check you in.,-1
2017-02-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,canceled six hours prior,False,  San Jose to Fort Lauderdale. Our flight was canceled six hours prior to departure and we only received an email. There is no phone call no help rescheduling our ticket. We called the number and the staff was unable to find us adequate tickets quickly enough and seemed unable to navigate The search menu for tickets. It was extremely frustrating to talk to somebody who had trouble understanding us and do not know how to use the system. Upon arrival to the airport staff was rude and did not know how to we book our flights. The line was extremely long and moving extremely slow early because the staff cannot even help a single person. I was the fifth person in line to rebook my flight and I was not help for over an hour. This is unacceptable. Spirit staffers mail trained in inadequate to handle situations such as these. About the cancellation of the flight the reason they gave us was at the crew didn't show up.,-1

Read carefully and you won't be disappointed - I was pleasantly surprised!  Price was right so I couldn't complain. First flight went so smoothly literally nothing went wrong. Flight back had a 30 minute delay but we were able to board the plane so we were fine. I would rebook with Spirit for domestic flights. Seats aren't the most comfortable for anyone above 5'5, I wouldn't do a long flight. But 4 hours was just fine. Only downfall is the bag fees. Other than that, definitely open to booking with Spirit again.",1
2017-02-27,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,pleasantly surprised,False," Las Vegas to Denver with Spirit Airlines. Pleasantly surprised. Clean and comfortable cabin along with professional attendants. Flights on time. Not certain why so many negative reviews. Spirit did a great job. Boarding is quick and the carry-on bags were not a nightmare unlike my last flight on United where everyone had an oversized Roll-a-Board, without the space to accommodate them all.",1
2017-02-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Phoenix,,,,,,,2.0,rudest customer service,False,"  Minneapolis to Phoenix. The rudest customer service ever experienced. Spirit Airlines double charged me for my ticket, and when I called and made my way through the maze of numbers to finally speak with someone, she was so rude. I do expect to get the duplicate charge refunded (fingers crossed) but there was no apology, explanation, anything. She basically took care of the refund and hung up on me.",-1

So after booking my flight people started telling me that I was crazy to fly Spirit Airlines. For several weeks I worried and to my amazement when it came time to fly I was pleasantly surprised. None of the complaints that I read about happened to us and it was one of the best experiences we had. The flight was great, our seats were comfortable, the pilot was making jokes over the speaker and the attendants were awesome.",1

2017-02-25,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Kansas City,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3.0,rude staff of this company,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Kansas City via Orlando. I don't have a problem with the flight being delayed, I know it happens. My problem is with the rude staff of this company. There was no announcement made (over the PA system) about the 2 hour delay, I received an email at 7:45 a.m. (20 minutes after scheduled boarding) about the delay. I went to the scheduled gate (H8) desk to inquire about the notification of the delay, and an employee, very rudely, informed me that the announcement was made at gate H5! After conferring with other passengers, I confirmed that this was indeed a flat out lie, everyone found out by the late email! 10 minutes later while sitting about 20-25 feet away in the Kafe' Kalik I kind of hear the same employee yell something about the delay and the new departure gate H7! Completely unacceptable!! The tickets are cheap but definitely not worth the hassle of dealing with rude inconsiderate employees who are supposed to help make an inconvenient situation more manageable! Thank you, but no thank you.",1
2017-02-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Cancun,3.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,just feels a bit slimy to me,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Cancun. By the time I paid all the extra fees for ""frills"" like bringing a small carry on in addition to my purse for an international flight, the price was the same as other airlines if not higher. The pricing is not at all competitive, it just appears to be until you show up and discover it's a trap to get you to book what you think is a cheap flight. I see what their trying to do, but I really think they need to drop the carry on fee (at least!) if their going to survive. All in all I will not fly with this airline again nor would I recommend to a friend. It all just feels a bit slimy to me.",-1
2017-02-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Houston,,,,,,,1.0,free 1 round trip voucher is useless,False,"  I was on the flight from San Diego to Houston on 19 December 2016. The flight overbooked so Spirit asked for 10 passengers to give up their seat with another airline to Houston. All 10 volunteered passengers received a free round trip voucher to fly anywhere with Spirit. Anyway, I used this voucher to book for a flight from San Diego to Houston on online and it turned out that this voucher is worth only $49.06. I called Spirit and they told me that I cannot use this voucher for online booking. The voucher can only be used for booking over the phone so I told them the departure and return dates I want for the trip to Houston. After a minute of checking, the Spirit representative told me that the return date (Monday) is not available for booking over the phone with the voucher (it's available only for online booking). However, there are return dates on Wednesday and Thursday. I chose to return on Wednesday and it turned out that I still have to pay for the amount which they called booking fees same as the cost of booking the flight on online to return on Monday. In short, their free 1 round trip voucher is useless.",-1
2017-02-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,will never take Spirit again,False,"  This is the worst experience I've had with an airline. My mother and I were flying from Atlanta due to the flight being non-stop from there. Major traffic jam. We were 2 minutes late for our flight. It was friday. We learned that the next flight from Atlanta to Tampa was sunday from a very rude employee, who was obviously desensitized. There was a man there that was giving the employees hell about missing the flight. After dealing with rudeness and inconsideration, my mother and I walked away to go home. As we were walking away, they recalled the last call for the flight (we assumed that they wanted to appease the man giving them a hard time). We turned around and ran to make the gate. They closed the door the minute we got there and told us they were not opening it again. I called the airline, spoke to a guy with a deep accent that I hardly understood. He told me that this was nothing in their control and that they will not giving me any refund or voucher of any kind. Paid for my flight about three weeks in advance, completed online check-in and paid $160 in advance to check in bags. I got nothing. I will never take Spirit again.",-1
2017-02-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Niagara Falls,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,worst service by any company,False,"  Myrtle Beach to Niagara Falls. The worst service by any company I have ever dealt with. They cancelled my flight due to weather, which was non existent. I checked with both airports and weather stations and Doppler. They wanted to rebook my children and I for a flight 7 days later then our original itinerary. When I asked to fly from a closer airport they wanted to charge me more for my return flight. Their solution was to fly all night, change planes 4 times for an extra $1500! That was my first hour plus on the phone with them. I did my own research, and found Latrobe to be my nearest airport at 4.5 hours away and a return flight to Myrtle Beach 4 days later. My next hour plus no the phone with them was to argue the additional fee they wanted to charge to rebook me. Finally they extended a one time courtesy to change with no additional costs. However I still had to rent a car and pay all expenses involved with the trip with no reimbursement. My children missed extra days of school and events. This company doesn't value their clientele's time at all. You are just a dollar amount to them. The plane is dirty, seats uncomfortable, they nickel and dime you. Everything is extra including your seats. Would never recommend this airline to anyone!",-1

No problems at all and both departure and arrival flight actually arrived early. Easy and quick online check in. Friendly service. We did pay extra to make sure we sat together and paid to check 1 bag, and paid extra for more leg room but still saved $400 flying with Spirit Air. I would much rather have the choice to pay for luggage or to buy a water for a small price than pay for an expensive flight and have so called ""free"" checked luggage or beverages. One flight did not have reclining seats and one flight did. All in all, very pleased.",1

While they have better legroom for basic traveler over United, their on time departures get a ""F"". Sat in St. Thomas Airport for 5 hrs on February 18th. We found out the morning of return travel that our plane was going to be delayed by 30 minutes. By the the we got to the airport is was 2 hrs. Then didn't take off for another 45 minutes. Basically your whole day revolved around Spirit. Plus their land and air crew need to get their stories straight. The ground crew told us the delay was due ""to too much traffic in the sky around Ft. Lauderdale"", while the plane crew was telling us it was due to, ""rain delayed in Atlanta"". No way to run an airline.",-1

Now expected to be here until 1:30am so won't arrive in San Diego until 4:00 or so in the morning. Will never use this airline again.

My husband felt I needed much needed time away. We were on our route home when an hour into flight we had maintenance problem. We stopped in Colorado. We weren't even offered a cup of water. After 3 hrs did we get back on board. We had to land again in Colorado yet again. We hadn't even left the state. This time we were told we had to refuel. After an hour we were now told we needed to switch crew. Again we weren't offered not a glass of water. Our 5 and a half hour flight turned into 11. Not once were we given food or a drink. They told us we would get voucher with $50 on it. It's to be use on another Spirit Airlines within two months. I will never use this airline again so it's virtually useless. It was unacceptable. I understand having an emergency landing once but twice?! Never in my life have I had an experience this horrific. Along with the 77 other people on flight. There was a child under the age of 5. She was not offered water or food in the dreaded 11 hour flight.,-1
2017-02-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1.0,denied access to board,False,"  Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. Buyer beware, this was a truly horrific experience. Arrived at airport prior to the check in time on our ticket that we printed at home. We were to be in a fast lane for bag check. Over 1 hour later almost 30 of us were denied access to board plane because they made almost every other person repack their bags in front of them - not allowing anyone to pay overage charges. People missed connecting flights, missed birthdays with grandparents and missed cruises. The staff was not friendly or compassionate or applogetic. Took 27 minutes to get refund receipt which will take up to a week to receive!",-1
2017-02-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGA to ORD,,,,,,1.0,1.0,worst experience with an airline,False,"  New York La Guardia to Chicago. The worst experience with an airline I have ever had, and I didn't even make it onto the plane. The flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems on the plane, which happen, but if you can't repair it within a few hours, that gives me pause about flying with that airline at all. I was only notified of the cancellation by email; some other passengers at the airport had not been notified at all. I waited in line at the counter at the airport for nearly an hour, although there were only a few people ahead of me. The computers and the employees were extremely slow. When they checked in people for a flight that was not cancelled, it took at least 15 minutes. Then to deal with people who wanted new flights for the cancelled flight took even longer. Their automated check in kiosks were not working. Staff were all very young and unfriendly, and unhelpful. They could not find another flight out for me for over 24 hours. The fact that there were no other flights was not their fault, but their dealing with it and lack of apology about the situation was ridiculous. On top of all that, when they pulled up my information to give me a refund, my information was associated with an address in Alabama, and I have never lived in Alabama, nor would I record my address as being there. The airline was careless with my personal information, and it's still a mystery how my credit card is associated with an address in another state. I will never again book a flight with this airline.",-1

My big gripe with this airline is the cost for luggage. A bag that normally is considered a carry-on cost me $50 and my suitcase also cost $50 when JetBlue only charges me $25 and the carry-on is free. $100 dollars for a suitcase and normally a carry-on? Are you kidding me? Its partially my own fault for not flying JetBlue both directions. Next time I use kayak or another website I'll make sure Spirit is never an option for my travels. Completely unacceptable.,-1
2017-02-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Phoenix,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,stay away from this airline,False," Dallas to Phoenix with Spirit Airlines. Worst rip-off and scam, charging $65 for all carry on luggage. Nowhere on the online booking via Justfly.com were we told that Spirit Airlines charged for carry on luggage. We flew American Airlines from PHX to DFW and no charges for carry on luggage but was hit with a fee flying with Spirit Airline from DFW back to PHX. The staff were rude and arrogant aboard the plane as well as at the ticket booth. We will never fly Spirit Airlines again. They cost more than any other airlines once you add these ridiculous fees to the flight. The plane was antiquated and very uncomfortable. They even charged passengers for water. Something offered for free on every other airline. I can't imagine any other way for Spirit Airlines to gouge their customers that wasn't used. Stay away from this airline.",-1
2017-02-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to San Diego,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,company does not understand their own policies,False, Chicago to San Diego with Spirit Airlines. Bag charges were not consistent to the posted signs at gate and different than the internet specifications. Only some people with roller suitcases were charged extra while others weren't charged. Bags in one city deemed carry on were not the same in another city. Customer service could not answer why I was charged more at the gate than what is posted on their own website? Very frustrating to deal with a company that does not understand their own policies.,-1

They advertise low prices, but charge ridiculous prices for carry on's, luggage, snacks, seating, boarding. I paid $150 for one 35 pound bag to and from my destination. I had a layover in Dallas and they charged me an additional $50 for my bag to arrive to Los Angeles, which was my final destination. The plane was dirty. You would expect that with all the fees they charge, the plane would be clean. The flight attendant was rude.",-1
2017-02-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline to deal with ,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. Spirit Airlines is the worst airline to deal with for anything. They nickel and dime you, but that aside. I just attempted to cancel my flight 11 days before I was schedule to fly. I had to cancel due to an unforeseen family emergency and they told me that all they can do for me is offer me less than half the value in credit with their lousy airline, and I have 60 days to use it. This is atrocious! I will avoid Spirit like the plague. I've flown with them once before and hated it, but now that I know how they due business even outside of the airport, I will never fly with them again.",-1
2017-02-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,first time and last time£,False," This was our first time and last time booking with Spirit Airlines. Flying out Niagara Falls to Fort Lauderdale. Our scheduled flight was for February 4th at 2:30 AM. We drove to the airport to check in (over the border as we live in Canada) and got to the airport for midnight and were told the flight had been canceled due to staffing issues for the plane. It completely ruined the beginning of our vacation and we lost 700 dollars in reservations for our full day lost. They gave us a whomping 50 dollars to use to fly with them within the next 2 months. What a joke. So happy we chose to fly back with Allegiant Air. A much more established and reliable company. We started googling Spirit after and realized they use this excuse often, so be careful. Allegiant is just a cheap and way more reliable.",-1
2017-02-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Houston,,,,,,1.0,1.0,airline won't last long,False,  New Orleans to Houston. When you get to the check in terminal there is a nice $55 per bag charge for carry on or checked. Also arrived 56 minutes before departure on return flight and was told that I couldn't board because I was 4 minutes late. Asked what they could do and was told I could book another flight for tomorrow. Flew back on United. Never using Spirit Airlines again. This airline won't last long doing this to customers.,-1
2017-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,worst airline experience ever,False,"  Seattle to Los Angeles. Will never be giving another penny to this company. Flight was delayed for bad weather (not in their control) and we were notified via email of the issue. A 21.30 flight turned into a 01.40 (again, not in their control) and yet we planned accordingly. We got to the check-in kiosk at 12.45 to find it empty, the self service kiosks offered no Spirit icon to print out a boarding pass and the only people willing to help was TSA. TSA had explained that they had left the kiosk quite some time ago to board the plane. So let me get this strait, Spirit has the same people printing tickets and boarding customers?! Unbelievable! I was directed over to Alaska Airlines (an airline I'd recommend to anyone) to see if they could print out our passes and they were unable to assist, but it's not their job to pickup where Spirit fails. I'm not alone in this, there were nearly 20 others waiting at the kiosk to whom also missed their flight. This evening resulted in $220 tickets, 2hr drive, $25 parking fee and a missed weekend with family. As a member of the military and in high hopes to see family I haven't seen in almost a year this has been the worst experience with any carrier I've ever had. I literally watched my flight leave without me. Maybe Alaska Airlines can continue to provide me with upstanding service that Spirit Airlines can't. I'd wait for the next flight, but maybe you'll be having your employees cleaning the restrooms since you already have them wearing several hats. It's now 02.30 and I'm driving back home and not on my way to family. We've been notified since last night that we're each getting $50 travel vouchers for Spirit - are you kidding me?! Doesn't cover half of what we put into this fiasco and we get vouchers back to the worst airline experience ever.",-1
2017-02-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Havana to Panama City via Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,cancelled due to not enough staff,False,"  The first Spirit Airlines flight from Havana to Fort Lauderdale went fine. There we checked our luggage in again and got our new boarding passes. We went to the gate where we waited to board. 30 minutes before the flight were scheduled to take off, it was announced the flight was cancelled due to not enough staff. So we had to go down and get a new ticket for the following evening and got some coupons for a hotel and some coupons for some food (7$ pr meal, a meal was about 20$). We had a small, local flight in Panama we would miss, and they wouldn't do anything to help us. So when we got to hotel at 1 am, we had to go online and book a new ticket. The next day we go out to the airport 3,5 hours before we are flying out. I have never seen so many people waiting in line. They must have known a lot of people were getting to the airport. But they still only had a few counters open. It took forever and there was no help and not at once did anybody said they were sorry for the convenience. Never going to buy a ticket from that company.",-1

Luggage check and pickup smooth and fast. My ID along with credit cards fell out of my pocket during the return flight home. We arrived near midnight and didn't notice what was missing until getting to my car in the remote lot. By the time we were able to get back to the gate everything was closed. I called the next morning to the lost and found area they told me it was found and that they would send it FedEx. It was at my expense and I needed to set up an account which I did. I called back with the account number, and it arrived at my door the next day. Thanks for making a difficult situation better than it could be.",1

How can I start - the seats are not comfortable, customer service sucks, you get charged for everything, if you want to speak with someone over the phone is really hard to get on the phone. Besides my flight got cancelled few hours before coming home when all the other airlines were working fine. I call to find out the just keep offering me USD280 refund so I could book another flight with 4 people - they didn't offer any help on finding another fly or which it was costing me USD480 for four people. I had to book another hotel because they couldn't even get me a hotel which they simple didn't care the fact that I was with my daughter 8 years old. They just simply say we ""offer you a refund"". I been to other airlines and when they cancel my flight they put me into a hotel to at least stay until the next day. The fact that I lost a day of work my girlfriend lost a day of work my daughter lost a school day and my brother in law lost a college day and their answer was we could offer you a refund got me so heated. I will never take this flight again they don't care about their customer at all, they are train to say we'll refund you money bac.",-1

I laugh about 1 star reviews, better sit at home in your air bubble and don't go anywhere. Everything was great from beginning. I am a foreign immigrant, English is my second language, but I can speak, read and write fluently. So, I go on website and read first what they say. You print your ticket home (it says a $10 charge otherwise). Check the size of the baggage, weight, checked bags, etc (if you want a deal, buy online or pay more). My plane A321 had ""big seats"", emergency exit seats and economy, so I paid extra $5 for emergency exit seat. Front desk was super friendly (Denver and FLL). Got baggage confirmation and info about my flight. Flight attendants all helpful, nice and polite. We had little delay (Denver) due to seat problem but we got full info and Captain said we will make it on time (we did). I would recommend Spirit Airlines to everyone. Tickets are cheap, this is all that I need. If you wanna full service, buy ticket from a different airline. You ll get your water, wifi, etc for double, if you can t handle flight between 2-4h.",1
2017-01-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LGA to BOG via FLL,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,had a terrible experience,False,"  LaGuardia to Bogota via Fort Lauderdale. We had a terrible experience with Spirit Airlines. They catch you by having low prices, and then charge $50 for a checked bag and also charge for a carry on bag and seats! They do not offer any free food or beverages in flight, even water. You may purchase an 8 oz bottle over water for $3. The seats are awful and don't recline and there was no in flight entertainment whatsoever. On our return flight we had a layover in Fort Lauderdale. There was a storm in the northeast so our flight to LGA was cancelled, which is understandable. However, when I called to reschedule my flight they told me I had already booked the flight and therefore could not book a new one. I had to fight with the representative to convince them it was impossible for me to board a cancelled flight and was finally offered a new flight 2 DAYS later. I booked a new flight with American Airlines for the next morning and called Spirit for a refund. I was told that because my flight was connecting, I was ineligible for a refund, despite it being cancelled. It took me asking for a supervisor and yelling at them to get a refund. Absolutely unacceptable customer service. I would never recommend this airline to fly. It is one thing to have low prices and charge for extras, but good customer service should be a given.",-1

I am a small person at 5 feet tall and I found the seat narrow and leg room very limited. A six-foot male passenger riding in the window seat of my row was so cramped I gave him my aisle seat. Surly flight attendants. I was charged for everything onboard, including water at $3.00 per small cup. Charges ($40.00) for carry on luggage.",-1

Flight was delayed 2 days due to ""weather"" - not in departure or destination, but in other parts of the country where the plane must have gotten held up. The airline made me re-pay ($45) to sit next to my husband (even though we had paid already for our original flight). I was on the phone for over an hour to not have to repay the 60$+ dollars for the checked luggage that ""disappeared"" from our reservation. Moreover, it appears that without my approval our credit card was overcharged $16 from what they originally told me I'd have to repay. The seats are tiny and you cannot recline. The flight attendants were rude. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! The $260 round trip flight for my husband ended up costing $490+ after fees/ baggage and 2 days of neither one of us working due to the delay. How horrible!",-1

Flew Spirit from Los Angeles to Detroit. Worst customer service and not military friendly at all. When we booked we were told that the military gets free luggage (which turned out to be a lie). On the flight my 3 year old had to go to the restroom, he was screaming he had to go potty but they wouldn't allow him up to use the restroom. He soiled himself and the flight attendant said (this is why you carry extra clothes when traveling). The seat belt sign was on however the flight wasn't rough at all. The flight attendant was more concerned with the other passengers getting their alcohol because they received cash tips. This was a red eye flight and was the loudest flight I have have traveled due to drinking, music, and young passengers. More suitable for college kids. It was our first and last time traveling with this airline!",-1

I can say without hesitation that Spirit Airlines is far worse. My first flight with them was last year, when they allowed me to board my first flight, cancelled my connection and told me the next connecting flight was in a week. The customer service agents were rude and unhelpful. Now on my second and last flight with Spirit from Chicago to Denver, they have once again cancelled my first flight and wont provide me with any compensation. They are blaming it on the weather but there isn't a single airline other than Spirit that has cancelled another flight. The base price might be cheap but they look to take advantage of you at every corner, it always ends up being far more expensive for a truly horrible experience. Shameful.",-1

2017-01-16,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGA to DTW,3.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,I had an excellent experience ,False,"  I had an excellent experience flying Spirit Airlines from La Guardia to Detroit roundtrip. My travel plans changed at the last minute, and the cost of the Spirit roundtrip was far less than the change fee Delta would have applied to my original ticket. Because I was traveling by myself on a short trip, it was easy to take just a personal item and to print my boarding pass at home--meaning I avoided any additional fees from Spirit. I was pleasantly surprised by the condition of the aircraft. The outbound was a very new-looking Airbus, while the return was another A320 with slightly older seats but refreshed interior. Frankly, the condition of both planes was far superior to my most recent flights on American and Delta. The seats themselves were fine for a flight less than 3 hours; I did not feel like I had much less legroom than the mainline carriers even with a 6' frame. The staff were also uniformly friendly. The usual caveats apply with Spirit - think about how much the ticket will cost if you need to check bags or bring carry-ons, recognize you'll have to pay more to reserve seats next to each other as a group, etc. I'm also lucky that I did not have to use Spirit's customer service during irregular operations. But for a domestic leisure trip, Spirit was great, and I would absolutely fly with them again.",1
2017-01-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to PBG via MCO,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,very poor and unsatisfying,False," Fort Lauderdale to Plattsburg via Orlando with Spirit Airlines. We arrived 3 hours before the flight (domestic), waited for those 3 hours and we were still not at the check-in counter. The first 30 minute wait was outside the airport and that morning it was 42F degrees (5C) outside. Some people (with freezing chlidren) in line had printed bording passes and only carry on luggage, but still had to wait. We had already printed our bording passes and we could have just dropped off already paid luggage. During those 3 hours (with our 3 children), it was total chaos at the counter and 5 police officers showed because of bad management from the Spirit agents regarding unsatisfied and stressed customers about to miss their flights. Agents were calling for travellers (not by intecom) for flights that were about to leave. Not everyone (especially those outside) could hear the annoucements given by the agent. Finally, we heared the call for our destination and we were rushed to the counter. After check-in, we ran to the security zone. Another agent was calling for flights about to leave and rushing us to the security. After that, was the run. Our 3 children were crying because of the stress of the run with their bag and not having time to go the the washroom before getting on the plane. We finally boarded and left without all passengers. At arrival at our destination, we had a missing luggage. Waited another 45 minutes before we could talk to an agent and fill out the necessary papers. The luggage arrived 1 day after promised arrival (4 days after the flight). After leaving 7 voice messages to the luggage service department (because no one sems to answer at that number) we finally got a general email about how to claim missing luggage which was not specific about our situation. Over all, our experience with Spirit is qualified as very poor and unsatisfying. We travel 3-4 time per year and this is by far, the worst service received.",-1

Flew from Dallas Fort Worth to Cartagena, Columbia via Ft Lauderdale, FL. The price was less than half of the next cheapest fare even taking into consideration the charges for extra luggage. I was pleasantly surprised that everything went well and we arrived in Columbia on schedule. The plane was new, the seats had as much room as the American Airlines planes I usually take and the staff were friendlier than the average AA employee. The only hitch was that I didn't have a round trip tix and I was traveling international.

The second flight canceled with this airline within 3 days. And plus a damaged luggage and missing 2 important meetings. I won't recommend this airline if you have something scheduled or a connecting flight. You can fly with them if you have time to spend in the airport, like 10+ hours.",-1
2017-01-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to IAH,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,not much cheaper than a regular ticket,False, Denver to Houston. Spirit Airlines is not that much cheaper than a regular ticket. They make you pay for seat and check in bags are $45 and overheads are $40 one way which is outrageous. Seat is $10-25 and of course food is bought too. United ended up being the same price that we paid. Spirit is horrible with keeping their flights on time. I really would never fly on this airline again.,-1
2017-01-11,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to MCI,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,staff were very friendly,False,"  I bought round trip tickets on Kayak to Los Angeles from Kansas City. All my ticket options were really high except for Spirit. The reviews I had read were terrible, but it couldn't argue the price ($88 round trip). I did research and knew what I was getting into; charge for bags, no reclining seats, no wifi, no free food, etc. It truly was a ""no frill"" experience and I don't think a lot people with bad reviews realized this when they booked their flight. You are allowed one personal item, but for a quick five day trip, I had no problems fitting in all my clothes and bathroom stuff in a small duffle bag (pictures below). The staff on both flights were very friendly and the seats were comfortable. Food was available for purchase for people that wanted it. Overall, Spirit was perfect for me and my travel needs. Just know what you're getting into and have bags that are regulation (yet, even then, no one ever checked mine).",1
2017-01-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to BOS,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,choose another airline,False,"  My wife and I had a wedding to attend in Miami on 1/7/2017. We booked with Spirit to fly Boston to Fort Lauderdale return, due to their low fares. We hadn't read any reviews or fine print on Spirit's website. We booked through Expedia where none of that information was readily available. We arrived at Logan Airport a few hours before our flight the morning of the wedding. Earlier that morning we ""checked-in"" online to both the flight to FLL and the return flight back to BOS. We never received any notification that either of these check-ins did not go through. We got to the airport and printed out our boarding passes at the kiosk without any issues. The flight was delayed - likely due to the very unfortunate circumstances at FLL on 1/6/2017 and the snow that was happening in BOS. This was understandable as neither of these things can be controlled by any airline. The flight eventually left and we arrived late to the wedding, but still had a good time. We did not try to check a bag although almost all other reviews show that this process with Spirit is miserable and filled with problems and headaches. We arrived the next morning to FLL for our return flight and waited in line to get to the counter to print out boarding passes. The line was long and by the time we got to the front well over an hour had passed and we were 1.5 hours out from our departure time. The representative at the counter told us to use the kiosk to print our boarding pass if we weren't checking a bag. She called for the next in line without even bringing our information up so we walked over to the kiosk. The online check-in clearly didn't work as we kept receiving an error message when we tried to print them. We went back up to the counter and asked if she would print our boarding passes. She said we must not have checked-in online 24 hours or more in advance so there was nothing she could do even though we paid for tickets. She refused to put our information in and manually print a boarding pass which blew our minds. They refused to refund the flight or put us on another flight without paying for it. We argued with various representatives at FLL for some time and eventually the flight we were supposed to be on - and should have been on as we arrived 3 hours before it was scheduled to depart - took off. We both had to be at work for 8 am that Monday morning so at 8 am Sunday we rented a car and drove 21 hours straight through the day and night to get back and go to work. During that ride we called Spirit customer service. The first four attempts were received with a busy signal - it's 2017 what business doesn't have call-waiting or something equivalent?! We finally got through and we were placed on hold for over an hour. When we finally spoke to a representative they couldn't do anything without their supervisor. The supervisor finally spoke with us (and sounded suspiciously like the person who answered originally) said there is nothing I can do your reservation is marked as a no show. How are we a no show if we waited at the airport for 3 hours waiting for someone to print us a boarding pass? Spirit refused any responsibility and said tough luck you can always choose another airline. And that is exactly what I will do in the future. I do not understand how you can pay for a flight months in advance and then be denied a boarding pass and a refund for that flight when they refuse to print it.",-1

At 4:03am, I received an email telling me that the flight had been cancelled. No reason given. Weather in MSP certainly wasn't an issue. It was clear and calm. This kind of thing happens often with Spirit Airlines. It's simply not an airline for grownups. The fare was cheap, but boy do you get what you pay for with Spirit.",-1
2017-01-09,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to RSW,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,will fly Spirit Airlines again,False,"  I heard a lot of negative things about Spirit and began doing my own investigation.  Jan 1st I flew out of Chicago O'Hare to Fort Myers. For those wondering about personal item, I brought a backpack that was bigger than the dimensions and they didnt say a word, didnt even have to put in in the little measuring box. I got to my gate and waited to board, we boarded a little late because the flight coming into O'Hare was delayed. This did not effect our departure time. The seat really wasn't that bad, I am 6'4 and I flew 3 hours and was fine. We left on time and arrived to Ft Myers early. The staff was nice and I have no complaints. A week later I flew back to O'Hare from Ft myers. This time I had the same backpack as a personal item and a duffel bag as a carry on. Again, not a word was said about my backpack or duffel bag.  Again, the flight left on time and was early again. The seats were fine. The staff was nice and it was a nice easy trip. Just know that you need to pay for your luggage and an exact seat if you want one. As well as the food. I will fly Spirit Airlines again.",1

Upfront cost may be low but consider you have to pay for carry on bags despite the bags meet carry on size and weights - $55.00 each. Trip not so cheap now with family of 4. Brought this to customer service attention she stated ""you could have paid upfront it would have been $25.00 a bag or you could have chose another airline"". I've been flying for years. I flew with my 3 children ages 17,14,13. They all had carry on bags ""with handles"" that we paid $55 extra for however this lady said they had to sit in zone one and I would have to sit in zone 2. Absolutely not going to happen. Will never fly this airline again.",-1

Waited in the line at the airport during 7hrs (we were not able to change the flight online or by call). Got another flight at 9pm the same day, delayed at 10:15 and eventually cancelled again. Another 2 hour line to hear the next flight available would be on Tuesday (total 11 hours at the airport). We requested a refund. No accommodation proposed, poor communication, very poor customer service. We had to pay another flight with United + 2 extra nights in hotel. This company is not reliable, worst experience ever. They told us bad weather was the reason althought all other companies landed in Newark the same day.",-1
2017-01-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BQN to FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,this is very disrespectful,False,"  Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Fort Lauderdale. My Spirit Airlines flight showed to be on time on 8th January. It got cancelled 7 hours previous boarding. I went to the counter since the customer service line was impossible to reach an agent, nobody showed up until 1am. There was no information whatosever. When the employees showed up, nobody knew what was going on, they tried to say that it was because the incident (shooting) 2 days ago. All other airlines were delayed, because of the storm, which I figured was our case. They offered to accommodate us in a flight 5 days after! Really, like you have no job. Also if there was a flight departing from San Juan they asked you to pay $180. I ended up getting $172 as a ""refund"" (I paid $490) and I had to book a flight for $642 via AA. Worst experience ever! It is insane. No customers skills whatsoever, nobody really know what was going on. An airline that charges you for everything cannot have these type of service. No reasonable acommodation, no even a voucher. This is very disrespectful. I rather pay a little more for a decent service. Hopefully we don't have to deal with this poor service for much longer.  There were other flights cancelled and delayed but immediately the airlines looked for reasonable accommodation to keep the customers calm.",-1
2017-01-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MBJ to MYR via FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,excuse after excuse,False," My husband who requires a wheelchair and I were returning to Myrtle Beach via Ft Lauderdale. When in Montego Bay, because I had informed Spirit we required a wheelchair, they provided an attendant who stayed with us and preboarded my husband on the plane. When we arrived in FL we were told to wait until most of the customers had deplaned so that they could provide wheelchair assistance. There were over 10 people that required this and Spirit at 3 people at gate - and they parked my husband in a corner and then attended to another flight that just arrived. By the time we got through customs, we had missed our connecting flight. No one at Spirit would help us - I even asked just for a recommendation on a hotel for the night and they would not help us. The ticket counter informed me that I could not get a flight to Myrtle Beach for another 72 hours. So I booked two one way tickets to MB on another carrier for $1250.00. I called and informed Spirit once I returned home of the issues and six weeks later they emailed me with excuses ranging from I had not informed them my husband needed a wheelchair to I never talked to anyone at the ticket counter. Therefore, they were not at fault. The person emailing has come up with excuse after excuse to not reimburse me for the additional tickets after it was Spirit's mishandling of customers that required assistance. I will never fly this airline again.",-1
2017-01-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MSP to PHL via ATL,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,they're not reliable,False," I booked a flight with Spirit Airline from Minneapolis to Philadelphia via Atlanta and it was my worst experience. We landed in ATL from MSP and waited for our next flight to PHL which was to leave at 7:43. They kept delaying the flight until 11:30 before they told us that they canceled the flight due to fuel problem. They give us 3 options 1) To refund us the fare from Atlanta to Philadelphia. 2) We can get on the next flight to Philadelphia at 7:43 the next day or 3) they will give us customer credit. I was so confused and didn't know what to do, because it was my first time in Atlanta, moreover I didn't know anyone to spend the night with. After the give us these 3 options, they never accommodated us. I spent 2 days in the airport waiting on my flight to Philadelphia. The worst of all, they have poor customer service. Their workers don't know how to talk to customers, they're very disrespectful. I'll never ride with Spirit Airline. If you're reading this and was thinking of riding with them, I'll encourage you not to, because you won't like your experience. They're not reliable.",-1
2017-01-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MBJ to FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,they showed absolutely no compassion or concern,False,  On Monday 01/02/17 Customs computers crashed causing major delays Nationwide. We were stuck on the Tarmac for 1 Hour & a half. I understand 100% that the delay was due to customs not Spirit Airlines. My problem is the way Spirit Airlines handled this situation. They showed absolutely no compassion or concern for their customers. They basically said they don't have to do anything for us because it was customs fault not theirs. The only flight they offered was for Wednesday at 8.50pm. They didn't offer to help us get a flight on another airline and did nothing to help us find a hotel. The staff at the counter were so rude to everyone there. The prices seem lower but when you factor in the obscene baggage charge you end up paying more and get treated like garbage in the process.,-1

Flew from Houston to Baltimore. Spirit is the worst airline ever. Seats very uncomfortable, can not be tilted. Very little leg room. They did not even provide a glass of water. There was no entertainment such as TV etc. They trap you with a lot of hidden fees. Avoid this airline at all costs.",-1
2017-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,IAH to FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never receive my business again,False,"  I was scheduled to fly out of Houston into Ft. Lauderdale at 12 noon. On the way to the airport I got an email stating my flight would be delayed until 2pm. I ran some other quick errands and arrived to the airport on time for the delayed flight. I was traveling with my almost 2yr old daughter. To make a long horrible story short, Spirit allowed us to board the flight, wait 45 mins while passengers and crew got on then asked us to exit the plane so that mechanics could assess a mechanical problem. We left our luggage on the plane and went back intothe terminal. Fast forward hours later after several delay announcements each time with a later departure time I went to the counter and requested a refund. Come to find out, the plane needed a part that had to be flown into Houston. I requested my luggage me returned to me and waited an hour in baggage claim to get my luggage. I never received my daughter's stroller back! I ended up driving my daughter 17 hours to Florida to meet with her grandmother. Spirit finally ended up officially canceling that flight around 11pm that night when I was already on the road to Florida. And for my trouble they gave me a $50 voucher!  I filled an online claim and spirit took days to get back to me. Then they said I needed to download the paper format of the claims form, fill it out, attach original receipts, and mail it to their office within 30 days of the date I traveled. Obviously they are hoping people wouldn't bother to go through all this trouble to recoup their losses. Horrible airline with no professional way to do business or way to treat their customers. They will never receive my business again. You truly get what you pay for. Cheap can sometimes be very expensive!",-1

On the flight to Florida the flight attendant in a rude manner asked me to change seats because I had not pay for extra leg room. I showed my ticket and receipt, but that was not enough. We had an argument and she was very upset. On the way back my flight would leave Florida at 8.50pm. I got to the check in line at 6.33pm. I asked for information and the rude attendant told me to wait in a line outside. We are talking a 1 mile line. Many passengers asked for updates and no answer was given other than you have to wait. At 8.30pm someone decided to help me. They did no want to check me in because it was too late however, I had been waiting since 6.33pm. They wanted me to pay extra for a flight in the morning. They did not want to pay for a hotel. They did not want to refund my money. Never fly Spirit if you have a chance. You will not save any money and you will have to go though lots of stress. They are not professional.",-1

I am a first time flyer and wish I read these reviews before I purchased the Spirit Airlines tickets. Our plane was supposed to board at 9:18AM, the flight was delayed to noon due to not having a full crew. At 12:10 they tell us that the plane has not even left the other airport yet, so we are delayed again but they dont know when the plane will arrive. I called the customer service number, they told me they can do nothing for me over the phone. I talked to the front desk, the guy behind the desk was getting yelled at by a mob of angry customers. I waited until they left to talk to him about the issue and he gave me new information that I should be arriving in Kansas city about 4/5 hours late.

2016-12-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,FLL to DEN,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,Spirit is no bargain,False," Bought my grandson round trip ticket from Fort Lauderdale to Denver with Spirit for it's competitive price and schedule. Then had to add essentially another near $200 for standard hold bag, carry on, and personal carry, plus seats. Essentially could have flown him almost first class for the same amount. Then as he is boarding in FTL, they charged him an additional 40 dollars, his expense money for the return trip, since he was returning with a larger bag. The details were he combined his carry on and hold baggage into one. I had paid for both already, but now they felt the hold bag with the carry on was too heavy. Slightly over 40 pounds. Thus he only had the one hold bag and no carry on. Simpler for him and them, yet they would not credit the weight of the carry on to the hold bag giving the kid a break and logical. So they took his trip food money as their last ditch effort to improve their margins. Spirit is no bargain and I'll never use them again. They are only out to rip off the customer anyway possible. I would also add he waited over 30 minutes before the bags got to the carousel in FTL. Deplorable.",-1

Worst flight I have ever taken, on by far the worst airline I have ever flown. The flight was delayed twice with no explanation. I am 6' tall, the leg room is so bad my knees were hard up against the seat in front of me the whole flight. The seats are very hard and uncomfortable. The baggage limit is only 40lb (almost all domestic is 50lb, so between 2 passengers I had to pay an additional $69.00. You can not even get a water on the flight without paying for it. Flight attendants spent almost the whole flight sitting in the galley watching their iPads. Once landed we had to wait some time to find a gate. As I write this, 45mins after the flight has landed, I am still waiting for baggage, as the arrival board still has not announced which baggage carousel.",-1

In the morning (Dec 22nd 2016 day of departure) get notice that flight #877 (Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale) has been delayed and will miss my connecting flight to St Thomas. Customer service was awful over the phone telling me to go to the airport counter to get issues resolved rather than help me get another flight. Once I reached the airport I am told that the flight will now be delayed 2.5 days (from Thursday 10.00 am to Saturday morning) and no other flights available till then. The reason was the crew did not show up in Philadelphia where the flight was supposed to take off. So I am supposed to miss my entire vacation due to their ineptness - no other ticket/flight was offered, nor did they make an effort to contact other airlines to help us reach our destination or anything else was provided. I cancelled my entire round trip ticket, asked for refund and had to personally go to other flight counters to ask for last minute tickets at 3 times the price I would have paid if I had booked those other airlines in the first place. Service at the counter was awful, no help, airline does not care about its passengers. The lack of help, professionalism, and options are shocking.

Not worth the advertised low price because you will end up paying more in the long run! I am very unhappy with Spirit Airlines as a company. I recently flew from Houston, TX to Orlando, FL with my children. My flight was changed from an afternoon flight to a 6:45AM. When I called to change to another non-stop flight on the same day they notified me that was the only flight time they had non-stop that entire week. I check in the day prior to our trip and have to pay $36 per carry on (that's after I joined their $9 club for $59.95) So I paid $144 to take (2) small overhead pieces of luggage. Btw, while waiting for our flight they announced prior to boarding your carry on items will cost $65 to be taken on the plane and once they have called for the 1st boarding it will increase to $100. On our return home (Christmas Eve) our flight was delayed to 1:30, then 3:30, 5:30, and then to 8:30pm. When I asked why the delay the told me a flight attendant was ill and they were trying to find a replacement in Minneapolis where are plane was coming from. They told us they would not officially cancel the flight till 8pm at that time they would make accommodations for us or put us on the next flight out (the following day 12/25 at 1:30) but they only had 1 ticket. The next flight she could book my children and I on would be 12/27. OR I could cancel my flight, they would refund me my money for that flight of $500, but I had to book my own flight with another company.

On my way back I took a Spirit Airlines flight ($78) which made a stop in Fort Lauderdale. TPA to FLL was delayed 45 minutes. There was a 55 minute window between that connecting flight. TPA assured all the connecting passengers that their flight to EWR was notified about a delay so we can still catch our connecting flight. At FLL, the door was closed 15 minutes ahead of schedule and about 30 people missed their flight! The plane was just leaving the gate and the agent apologized. They offered us new flights for the morning which meant spend money on a hotel and taxi. They offered hotel vouchers that didn't help out either because Expedia had the same hotels cheaper. So the gate agent asked me which morning flight would I like to take? She offered a 6am, 8am, 11am, 5pm, 8pm. I asked for the 11am flight, she gave me a new boarding pass, I was tired, exhausted, then took an uber ($23) to my hotel ($115). Ordered food ($32) and went to sleep. Woke up at 8am, called an uber ($26) back to the airport, checked my boarding pass, was given the 6am flight. Now I'm angry because the gate agent made a mistake. I went to Spirit desk to change the mistake, explained everything in a normal tone, unfortunately there was nothing they can do or the supervisor (both were very rude). I was left with no choice but to purchase a 11am flight ($110). Moral of the story, stick with major airlines. A cheaper flight ended up costing me more then what I'm used to paying. Then they end up taking advantage of your situation and leave you with no choice but to spend more $$$.",-1
2016-12-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,FLL to LGA,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,nothing positive to say about them,False," Flew Spirit from Ft Lauderdale to LGA. This is the worst airline out there. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about them. They advertise ""cheap flights"", which is completely incorrect. The same flight was significantly cheaper with Delta. Between the rude customer service, which coincidently is impossible to reach, the website that continuously crashes while trying to purchase a ticket, which I suspect must be a ploy so to can't read the fine print ""we charge $50 so you can lug your luggage through the airport"", the list is endless. When I was finally able to reach someone in customer service, it was apparent that I was calling overseas. They were both rude and condensending and they refused to deviate from the script and answer my questions. I could have gotten my ticket cheaper through Delta but wanted an AM flight. Boy do I regret my decision!",-1
2016-12-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MSP to FLL,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2.0,flight attendants were not very courteous,False,"  The plane flew the route and did not have engine or other problems, and it landed at the correct airport roughly when it was supposed to. This is the main positive. I won't state all the negatives, but I doubt I will take Spirit Airlines again. This airl charges for everything, including a printing of a boarding pass if you have the agent print one for you when you check in your bags. What if you paid $750 for a ticket but don't have money with you to pay for the boarding pass, are they going to tell you ""sorry you can't get on the plane."" Is this even legal. We had a check-in bag that was heavier than the limit for the basic check-in we had prepaid. So we had to pay extra. The agent overlooked that we had prepaid for our check-in so charged us the full price of a heavy bag, rather than the difference between a heavy bag price and what we already had paid. We had a connecting flight, so we paid extra twice. We are now trying to get a refund for the extra we paid. No drinks, no food on the flight. The plane was not full, and we asked the ticket agent if I could sit next to my niece who was on the same flight, and we were told we had to pay extra for this (a customer on the plane moved for us so we could sit next to each other, so problem fixed, but the airline did not help). Flight attendants were not very courteous. Airline did not move baggage from this flight to our connecting flight, so we had to go get our bag from Spirit baggage claim and go check it in at the Spirit counter for the next flight.",-1

During my layover to Dallas Fort Worth I was able to board my plane after 20 minutes but was told we had no pilot. We were then told to exit the plane and that a pilot was 30 minutes out they would then start boarding us once the pilot told us he was in the parking lot. After 45 minutes we were then told our flight was cancelled due to no pilot. I was unable to book a flight home within 24 hours and had to get a refund as well as most passengers. Spirit Airlines crew seem to have no care for the chaos that myself and other passengers we're dealing with - many were there with children. I was then told that I would get a refund within 7 to 10 business days and that my luggage would be refunded any immediately. I then had to come out of pocket and pay $232 to fly with another airline and my luggage was not refunded right away. I missed a day of work and spent over 40 minutes trying to find a ride home from the airport. I do not recommend.,-1

It is currently delayed for the 4th time and now due to depart at 1.30am. No one has come to explain why no one has bothered to tell us, it's just a display on the screen. Poor customer service, people with connecting flights have been here since noon waiting to go home. A flight that takes 45mins. A drive that takes 3 hours we have wasted time waiting on a flight farther them just take us on a bus. I will never waste my money on this airline again.",-1

I ordered her a wheelchair when I booked this ticket. She was told to have a seat and no one every came to get her. She was then told to go get her own wheelchair from the storage area. She had her boarding pass electronically on her phone. They refused to accept it and would not print her off a new one. She ended up missing her flight. She never even made it through security because they neglected to help her. She has a strong accent although she speaks English, but was told they didn't understand what she needed. They are now charging her $100 to rebook the ticket for 9:55 tonight. I have not been able to get anyone on the phone to resolve this issue. The airline supervisors have refused to speak to me so that I can advocate for my senior mother. My handicapped elderly mother is in tears and alone stuck in an airport with nobody who is willing to help her. This type of treatment is absolutely unacceptable.",-1

The amount it costs to check bags through this airline is absolutely insane. Most airlines will allow you to bring a carry on bag free of charge but Spirit charges you a fee that is even more than it costs to check a bag. Then if you have a heavier bag, they charge double the fee for that bag? I've spent more money on getting my luggage to and from my destinations than my actual plane ticket! They reel you in with cheaper airline fees only to slam you with the cost to check bags. Very unhappy and will look for airlines that include more in the future.",-1

When I post a review, I like to list pros and cons, however I am unable to do so because there are no pros. This airlines states that it has the lowest fares, but after paying for the tickets for 1 child and 1 adult, for one carry on, and seats (yes, I had to pay for the seats-I have never heard of this) I paid 340+. Friends who were going to the same place we were at the same time and leaving from the same location missed the flight check in by mere minutes and were unable to board. They booked a later flight and chose Southwest - paid 220, were able to check a bag, have a carry on, choose their seats for free.",-1

Plane was stuck in San Juan due to aircraft not receiving fuel. This delayed the flight for another 3 hours. The notification to all passengers was sent too late for travelers to adjust their schedules or make prior arrangements. This is an everyday occurrence that defines the significance of the staff knowing their job and not just looking for the next paycheck. Many people's lives were interrupted due to an employees inability to provide sufficient service per their employer Spirit Airlines. It's not the planes fault, but those who manage the functionality of the craft.  The snacks are unbelievably expensive. This was my first and last time. Choose wisely folks.",-1

They tell you upfront that everything is an add on. You pay for the flight only. I have flown with them several times and have had no issues with them. Yes the seats can be a little bit more comfortable but for the price paid it was what it was. I have no complaints. People want everything for free.",1

I've flown Spirit Airlines several times, always with the same bag because I was told on my first flight that it passed as ""free"". However, now on what was probably my 10th flight using that same bag, I was charged a fee of $100 because, as the attendant at the gate informed me, I didn't check it before boarding. Why would I check it before boarding when it's always been free? She just kept repeating the same thing over and over that I should've checked it before boarding. Zero customer service, and totally unprofessional. Also, there were 3 of us with the same circumstances, one of which was a younger teen traveling alone with no credit card to pay for her bag. Completely ridiculous. My cheap flight just cost me more than I would've paid for a flight with an airline that would've given me a more comfortable seat and dare I say it, a cup of coffee and snack.",-1
2016-11-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,IAH to PHL via MSP,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,a financial money pit,False,"  Houston to Philadelphia via Minneapolis. This review is about much more than money since it is clear from previous reviews that Spirit Airlines is a financial money pit. My poor experience began before I even stepped into the airport. The online check in was very difficult requiring more than the typical confirmation code, my company booked my flight so I didn't have an email and password. So I tried to call! That was a frustrating and fruitless effort. Spirit calls themselves web based, I guess they think that means they don't have to help anyone as they want all issues to be sent via their web site. Sometimes you just need a human to help. Managed to get on the plane and the flight attendant was kind. That is the only good thing I can say. The seats suck and do not recline.  My real trouble began when Spirit Airlines delayed my connecting flight by an hour. They sent texts/ emails and announced the delay. So imagine our surprise when we go to gate at the delayed time and they say they already shut the door. We can see the plane but they would not let us on after they announced a delay, they decided to retract the delay. There were others trying to get to a funeral and they had no customer service, no advice, nothing helpful. We lost our money, had to book other flights and try to reclaim our luggage since that was on the plane we watched pull away while the very rude ""supervisor"" did nothing but blame us for ""missing the plane""! We were there to board at the delayed time they told us to be. I will never never fly Spirit Airlines again and I urge you to go elsewhere. You will not save money anyway, trust me.",-1

The flight from NY was delayed by 4 hours and return flight was delayed by 1 hour. There was a weird pungent smell in the cabin. I was sitting with my friend in the penultimate row and there were employees of Spirit Airlines flying who sat in a row behind us. They were loud and inconsiderate.

First time using this airline. I've traveled on Ryanair so I knew the usual fee for a hand bag and the whole printing your boarding ticket before hand. My issue is I boarded a plane that was suppose to take me to Newark. Midway in the air the pilot says there is a ""maintance issue"" and we'll have to land in Atlantic City. They tell us there will be a bus to transport us to the Newark airport when we arrive. We waited at the airport for 4 hours for a bus to arrive. To then ride a 2 hour commute - during the morning rush hour. A flight that was originally suppose to leave at 9pm didn't leave until 10:30 pm due to ""weather conditions and air traffic"". There was no weather issue in neither of the 2 cities. Called the company after work (which I was late to due to this) and was put on hold 10 times to be told there is nothing they could do for me because I got on the plane and they provided transportation. They're the most uncoordinated, unorganized, unprofessional, ethicless company I've come across. I spent more than 12 hours in 2 different airports and all I was given out of it was a $50 voucher for future flights. For lack of better terms, they can shove it.

Ripped off with excessive luggage charges. We booked a complete round trip flight from Denver to Cancun and back via Orbitz. Our flight to Cancun was on United and our return was on Spirit Airlines. We had no problems with United, they were great. The Spirit return flight consisted of 2 legs with a layover in Dallas. Instead of charging us once for our bags being transported from Cancun to Denver, Spirit insisted on charging us twice, once for our flight leg from Cancun to Dallas and then again for the leg from Dallas to Denver. My wife and I had to pay total bag fees of $160 - $40 for each bag on each leg of our trip. I called Spirit to dispute the charge but they refused to help, saying that I must have made a mistake when I booked the flight. I didn't make a mistake, I have been successfully using services like Orbitz and Expedia for years.",-1

With the extra charges you can buy a ticket with a better airline and get better services that are included in the price with no surprises. Had to pay extra going back because this was not clear.

2016-10-26,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to DTW,3.0,,4.0,,,4.0,5.0,pretty nice price-quality ration,False,"  Pretty nice price-quality ration. That is obviously made by means of operational cost reduction - less seat space in airplane, less space and personnel in a check-in area, more than modest gate space and convenience (e.g in Boston Logan Airport). All extra services like checked bag, carry-on bag are payable as extra. Limitation for the checked luggage weight is 40 pounds vs 50 pounds on other airlines. Our flight from Boston was delayed on 2 hours, but they were very polite regrets made and frequent updates of the delay status by email. Our pilots work on a route Boston- Detroit was very nice - smooth and gentle taking off, riding and landing. On another flight from Detroit to Boston there was funny and friendly pre-flight announcements made by the crew.",1
2016-10-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to LAS,2.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,flight attendants were very nice,False," Boston to Las Vegas with Spirit Airlines. First off if you don't read the rules for Spirit, of course you'll be upset when you fly. I read the instructions like most people should do, and have no complaints about bag fees or any of the ""upcharges"" that everyone was complaining about. Went to Vegas out of Boston for 4 days, and packed 4 days worth of clothes, with dress shoes in a small, Samsonite bag that fit under the seat with room to spare. The flight attendants were very nice and accommodating, the terminal staff were normal (scanned ticket, hard to understand for announcements). Didn't expect luxury seats, which you won't get for the price of course. You have a very small folding tray on the back of the seat, and the seats aren't the best, but i've sat in worse. They don't recline (which I knew), and were hard to sleep in due to that. Aslong as you read and understand the rules, and don't have much to carry, then this flight will serve you just fine. The drinks / snacks aren't expensive at all, as I had 2 gin and tonics for $14, which is on par or cheaper than most bars.",1

2016-10-23,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to OAK,1.0,,5.0,,,4.0,4.0,happy with the savings,False,"  Los Angeles to Oakland. You need to know the rules to avoid frustration and crazy high fees. Before you book read the rules and restrictions on the website to make sure it meets your needs. I traveled for a short weekend trip to SF for $68 round trip. This fare included only a small piece of hand luggage that must fit under the seat. A full sized carry on was an additional $35 each way at the time of booking, $50 each way at the gate before boarding begins, and $100 each way after boarding begins. You can see how if you dont do your homework beforehand it can get very expensive and lead to a lot of anger and frustration. I packed only a small backpack filled with a couple days worth of warm weather clothing so i did not have to pay for the privilege of using the overhead bins. Additionally if you want priority boarding, want to pick your seat, want a water or soda in flight, or check in at the airport (as opposed to online) then they will nickel and dime you to death. For my trip had I added a full sized carry on it would have been about the same as had i flown Southwest or one of the other airlines. I understood this and figured that $60 savings would be better spent at a nice dinner or two in the city. Another thing, the seats are tight, and if you let them pick your seat for free you are almost guaranteed a middle seat. I am a big guy (6'1 225) and prefer an aisle seat, but for an hour flight I sucked it up. The flight crew was friendly, helpful, and courteous. There was no one with tape measures out making sure bags met requirements, so im not sure how they police their carryone policies. This all being said, I knew what awaited me and was happy with the savings. For a short flight for a weekend trip it'd be fine. i dont think I could go cross country though.",1

I fly a lot, and I've never had such terrible experience. I wish I had looked up this airline before booking my tickets; saving $209 was not worth it. Originally had a quick 20 minute layover, and planned on just staying on the plane to nap. However, everyone got out, so I just followed. Nothing mentioned or announced about delays whatsoever. Turned my internet back on. Several (7) emails from Spirit about delayed flights. Even one sent out an hour after the fight already took off! 20 minute delay, turned to an hour, turned to 3 hours. The screens and times not updated; the flight disappeared from all airport monitors and the gate had a different city listed. Good thing we asked our we would have missed it. Now we're finally on the plane and we've been sitting here for almost 2 hours. Talk about ridiculous. They announced it was about paperwork, and asked for 2 volunteers to get off. That's it, nothing offered to the volunteers except a flight in another airline. They even put the blame and spotlight on some poor people who were assigned broken seats and didn't want to split up with their party. Never taking this awful airline ever again, that's for sure.",-1

2016-10-15,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DTW to LAS,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,would absolutely fly with Spirit Airlines again,False,"  I booked my first trip with Spirit Airlines and was worried about my decision given all the negative reviews. I can gladly say that I had a great experience with them. The biggest piece of advice has been repeated over and over, do a little research and know their pricing rules. Their website is easy to navigate and doesn’t hide where the added costs can be incurred. To save a few bucks: 1) Pay in advance for your bags and pay attention to the sizes of each. Please, please do not wait until you’re at the airport to decide you want more than just a personal item. 2) You can fit a lot into a bag that maximizes the free personal item size requirements. Use it! 3) Consider sharing a checked bag with your travel partner. Most airlines allow 50lbs for a checked bag, but Spirit is 40lbs. There is no weight limit on the free personal item, so put your heavier items in that bag to avoid being overweight on your checked bag. Careful about the liquid/gel allowances. 4) Don’t bother with paying for seat selection unless you really need to. Check in online as early as you can, and chances are you will be seated next to your travel partner. If anything, someone could swap seats with you or you can handle a couple hours independently. 5) Don’t pay for shortcut boarding. You’ll get on the plane eventually and it will leave when everyone is on board. They do offer to board people traveling with small children or those requiring assistance first. 6) Print your own boarding passes. Most hotels offer a computer and printing station for your online check in boarding passes. 7) Bring your own snacks and an empty water bottle to fill at the airport. 8) Have a peek at the Contract of Carriage for anything that requires clarity and know what you’re entitled to. Pay attention to 7.2.5. (page 18) for items that don’t count towards carry on limits. What I liked about my trip: 1) The staff were all very friendly. Be kind and respectful and you’ll get it back. One flight attendant on the way back from LAS to DTW had a great sense of humour when making the overhead announcements. If anyone was rude, it was the airport staff at the security check. 2) Both flights left on time and arrived early. 3) Seats were comfortable (they don’t recline) and the leg room was enough for me at 5’8”. 4) No in-flight movie is no big deal. Bring your own entertainment or handle a couple hours without staring at a screen. 5) Other than the ‘frills’ you know you’re not getting, it was no different than flying with any other airline. You’re saving money. The only complaints I have are that: 1) I booked a package with Travelocity and was not given the option to pay for checked bags at the time of booking (which meant an extra $10 a bag when added later) 2) I had emailed to ask if mobile boarding passes were allowed (they’re not yet) and never received a response, but I did get an email asking me to do a survey about my satisfaction with their response to my question. Just like any other airline, flights get delayed or cancelled and baggage gets lost, but it’s about how the airline handles these situations that can affect my satisfaction with the airline (I’ve waited 30 hours through 3 cancelled flights in a row with another airline before). From what the Contract of Carriage says, their compensation does not seem too different from what other airlines offer. As I have not experienced these issues, I would absolutely fly with Spirit Airlines again.",1

Starts out cheap, literally everything has a charge - with the minimum of basic charges or later reservations it costs more than competitors. That aside, their planes have all the comfort of a city bus, they make up rules as they go and wiil often create delays or leaving early without proper notice. I'm sure I'm one of the millions that won't fly Spirit again, this review is for those yet to experience this airline.

Absolutely shocking service and rude staff throughout. We arrived at Cancun airport in good time only to be told that our flight was an hour late so we would miss our connection in Florida, not being able to be put on a different connecting flight until the day after we were told that accommodation would be sorted out ""at the other end"". We then discovered our flight was actually an hour and a half delayed with no explanation, and when we eventually boarded the plane there was a further hours delay on the tarmac. At which point no one apologized or explained what was going on, eventually it was put down to technical issues. Arriving at Fort Lauderdale we then had to wait to collect our checked bags, which took another hour and a half - again with no explanation as to why and some rude members of staff telling us off every now and then for being on our phones. Once we had our bags we started the search for the people that could sort us with a hotel for the night, having been redirected to someone else about 5 times we eventually reached the check in desk and explained our problem. The lady at the desk had no idea what we were talking about and was more interested in having a chat with her other friends at the counter. Eventually she disappeared out the back to ""see what she could do for us"". After a good 5 minute wait she reappeared with a multi coloured booklet of vouchers and told us to go outside for the shuttle bus to the hotel, which comes every 15 minutes. It doesn't, it arrived after about 45 minutes and was so full of Spirit Air customers that people were standing on top of their luggage in the aisle. Upon looking at our vouchers, we realised that we had been given a mere $7 each for food allowances - considering that our connecting flight was 11 hours later than planned $7 is not enough. Throughout the whole experience the staff were rude and there was no sign of an apology anywhere, or a clear explanation of what we need to do. I have since written to the company, who refuse to give me any form of compensation for loosing a day of my holiday in New York. They have told me that their aim is to get customers to where they require to be within 24 hours of their arrival time - sorry those of you who want a weekend somewhere or need to attend an important event on a given day, they'll be able to get you there the day after! Also, when talking to other customers on the plane (we had plenty of trapped time together), all said that they have had bad experiences with Spirit Air in the past, basically every time they have flown with them. I'm unsure why they keep going back to them, they may be cheap, but they cost us a night in our unused New York hotel - not cheap when you look at it that way. Will not be using again, no matter how many junk emails I receive from them for free air miles - which is a con by the way as you can't use them online or over the phone to book flights (another customer informed me).",-1

Our flight was delayed in Cancun for 30 mins and we were connecting in Fort Lauderdale. After the flight landed, we had to clear immigaration and custom without any assisstance from the Spirit team who were aware that we are running behind. After all we missed our flight. They said the earliest we could fly would be next morning at 7 am connecting flight thru Orlando. We paid for our hotel and taxi, then came back next morning. After we got on the plane, they said that they have computer problem and got us out of the plane and we lost our connecting flight from Orlando to Detroit.

The worst airline experience ever. I will never opt for another Spirit flight no matter the cost. Could have spent an additional $100 to fly United and I should have. I would have been fine being smushed into a tiny plane with rock hard seats if my return flight wasn't delayed. I now have to spend the greater part of today in the airport due to continuous, unexpected delays. While waiting I called Spirit's customer support number (which is nearly impossible to find) and instead of getting any assistance in finding a different flight or even just some information as to why the flight was delayed, the customer service agent said all she could do for me was help me set up a spirit MasterCard. I asked her if she was joking and she was not. She was incredibly rude and hard to understand. Once you fly Spirit you'll completely understand why the prices are lower, trust me it's no mystery.",-1

Both the departing flight and return flight were on time  both take offs and landings were smooth. If you use your head and prepare for your flight there will not be problems.

He told me that there is always extra charge for this airline. The night before the departure date, a relative told us there would be $25.00 charge for carry-on. At the airport, in front of the Spirit Airlines check in counter, there was a sign showing the samples of what size of luggage which is free and which would be extra charge. When it was our turn to see the lady at the desk, we were told that there would be $50.00 charge for a carry-on, regardless of size. What are you going to do? You are already at the airport. Meanwhile, another cousin wanted to join our holiday trip flying Delta and paid only $5.00 more got no charge for his carry-on luggage plus free lunch and snack while we got nothing.

I had no issues flying from LAX to PHX and it was actually a great experience minus the uncomfortable seats. Coming home from my trip, however, was a different story. I didn't have internet access where I was at in Arizona and couldn't ""check in"" before I arrived so I thought I could do it at the counter. Boy was I wrong! They close the counter 1 hr prior to the flights departure and no check ins or boarding passes are allowed. The guy also said that the names were not correct on the reservation. I asked him how I got there perfectly fine with no issues and the names were correct but Now they are wrong? The men at the check in counter could have cared less that I was standing there with two kids and no way home. They told me the supervisor wouldn't be back down until the flight left the gate. After he came down to talk to me, he stood behind the counter and waited for me do pick up all my bags and walk to him. I said ""no you need to come to me"". He came over and basically said that I was not compliant, that I was responsible to check in myself, and that there was nothing he could do for me. So I'm left standing there with with 2 young kids and no where to go and no desire to help. I was a hot mess. I went to enterprise to rent a car and spent 10 hrs in the car driving home. I will never fly spirit again. The crew inside the plane on the first leg of the trip was amazing! They just loved my babies. My oldest even got a picture with the pilot. But my way home was a disaster. I will be writing an official letter of complaint.",-1

It's a ""bare fare"", if you want luxury - buy tickets for a triple price from different airline. I was more than satisfied with our flight from Atlanta to Boston, and back. The flights were on time, arriving even earlier than anticipated. Customer service was superb, flight attendants cracking jokes, very courteous. I have read the bad reviews before our trip and was afraid, but decided that financial benefit in my situation is bigger than bad reviews. I would fly Spirit Airlines with no hesitation next time. Great job! I am sorry people cannot read what is included and what is not, and complain about their own mistakes. The one and only note - the seats are uncomfortable.",1

My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary with a trip we saved up for, to Cabo San Lucas. Got to airport prepared with all of our documents, printed and ready to go. We visited the desk to check our bag in with your customer representative, as we were excited and ready for our trip we were greeted by a very unhappy face. We did not get a smile, no hello, not anything. This was not a great start but let us move on and get over it. Flight time came around. We walked up to the desk after the lady at the flight check in made sure to tell everyone to have their passport open with the picture and if you don’t have it open on that page that you would be sent to the back of the line. Once we got to the male checking us in he clicked his tongue and said he doesn’t know why we weren’t forced to pay extra to print out our boarding passes on two separate papers instead of double sided.  Now for the horror show. Our flight was meant to leave on Monday around 2:45pm. As asked we got to the airport early with enough time to clear check-in etc. The staff was a little friendlier in Mexico at first. Check-in went as planned with no issues. We went inside for some lunch and walked over to our terminal to get ready to start boarding when we noticed that our flight has been delayed. Again not too unhappy since these things do happen. Well I guess it kept getting delayed and delayed so much that all the other flights left Cabo, the shops closed they even turned off the AC in the airport… This sucks since we could have booked another flight to LAX, San Diego or Santa Ana without having to spend more time in Cabo. Finally around 6:30pm after being at the airport for 6 hours sweating with no shops, food, water, Internet we were told that our flight has now been canceled with no reason offered as to why it was canceled. We were all booked, probably 120 people at the Best Western across the street. So if you have been to the Cabo airport there is the airport, Best Western and a gas station… That is it. When we got our hotel voucher we were told by Spirit that since my wife and I booked our vacation together we would have to share the $7 meal voucher YAY!! To make things worse, Spirit had 2 front desk people help 120 people with vouchers so imagine the wait. If you think that wait was bad, they got us a little van carrying 8 people at a time to transport 120 people to the hotel. At this time we were told that our flight might leave at 1pm on Tuesday. Spend the night at the great Best Western canceling work for Tuesday with poor internet. No apology was given until we received a $50 coupon for our next adventure with this great airline. Tuesday morning arrived and again we took the same van back to the airport with the rest of the army, checking in again. Our flight was scheduled for 1pm. 1:30pm rolled by with more delays saying we are waiting for the pilot to arrive! We actually saw one employee call the captain and his response was that he is busy on the phone? As he finally stopped his important call the whole “army” cheered him on as he walked by us all. This is now around 2pm, again no apologies no reasons! We would ask Spirit staff about the delays and we would simply receive an answer of only a couple more minutes.",-1

Terrible and I mean terrible customer service when it comes down to the Spirit employees. My family and I had zero direction to exactly what line we were supposed to stand in. When we did try and ask, employees we're rude, disorganized, and had no idea what was going on. We also had to switch planes once we finally got on because of mechanical difficulties.

I moved all of 2 feet within those 3.5 hours, only to find out that the flight was completely cancelled. They offered to give me $25 and re-book me on a flight that was a whole 24 hours later. I do not live in Boston. I did not have the money to book another hotel room for a whole additional night, and they refused to compensate anyone on a place to stay. I had work the following day in Las Vegas where I live, and had to explain why I wasn't able to come in, and pray I didn't lose my job because of their incompetence. I decided my only other option was to cancel with them, and find the next available flight with a different airline and spend an additional $200, and wait for 12 hours in the airport. The customer service was terrible. They were rude, unsympathetic, and unaccomodating. When I spoke with airport security, they said that this happens at least once a week with Spirit. I recommend avoiding them. You're better off spending a little extra money with a better airline and having the assurance that you are actually paying for a flight where and when you need to go.",-1

We did leave 2 hours late, but I did know that early in morning so we just didn't rush to airport and had time to eat before. The cons - uncomfortable seats that don't recline and very narrow aisle which is tough trying to get to the bathroom, no WiFi, no movies and no freebie snacks. The Pros - The smoothest flight I've been on in a long time. Good take off and landing. The flight attendants were friendly and funny.

It started with an email notifying us our flight was delayed. We were unable to print our boarding pass (which Spirit charges $10US if not printed and brought to airport) just given an Urgent notification to see a gate agent at scheduled flight time. We had to be at the Cartagena airport and through customs at the scheduled flight time even though our flight was delayed more than 2 hours. Do not expect to get any help from customer service unless you speak fluent Korean. The gate help isn't any better as they are understaffed and follow a script they will not go off. Missing our return non-stop flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Denver resulted in our return being delayed a day, and routed: Ft. Lauderdale to Atlanta, Atlanta to LA, LA to Denver. We were given no options even though there were other flights (even on Spirit) available. They did give us a hotel voucher however they gave out more vouchers than rooms available. The flight attendants are pleasant. Food and drink prices are reasonable. So, if all you are concerned about is price, time is not a problem, and you don't mind long lines at airports, Spirit is marginal in these areas. I, however like direct flights, keeping on schedule, and a customer service that you can carry on a conversation in English.",-1
2016-08-15,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,OAK to MSY via LAX,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,5.0,not particularly comfortable,False,"  I completely understand the negative reviews of Spirit but, if you want to save money, actually understand the rules, and are willing to deal with tight seating, mediocre customer service, and a spotty on-time record, Spirit might work for you. Anything other than a personal item will cost you extra. This is very clearly explained when you're booking. Deal with it. Seating is tight and not particularly comfortable. This is also explained during booking. Deal with it. If you need overhead space, pay to board early or take your chances. This isn't rocket science. Aside from potentially saving some serious cash, the biggest perk on Spirit is the credit card application deal they offer on some flights. Fill out a credit card app in-flight and you get a 2,500 mile voucher for free. That's good for a free one-way flight.

Last time the flight was delayed, baggage fees were high and the seats were very uncomfortable and crowded. Saving money was the goal, but in the end this airline is not passing on savings to its customers. Prices look cheap but adding baggage fees and any other little courtesy they charge you for makes the flight the same price as other airlines that don't pack people in like Sardines. Today's flight from Los Angeles to Dallas Fort Worth was delayed and after being ushered through a strange ancillary security line that barely moved, having nowhere to sit at the gate because of all of the other poor souls with delayed flights so I paid for an overpriced breakfast at a restaurant for comfort. Never again. The bad service throughout the entire process is like salt in the wound from realizing I'm not paying any less for a poor experience.",-1

2016-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to LAS,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,will end up paying more in the long run,False,"  I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with the entirety of this company. I have been traveling for more than twenty years and I have never experienced an airline, or any company for that matter, with such unwillingness to right their wrongs. I took a flight from Boston Mass. to Nevada on 7/25/2016 which was delayed about an hour and a half. Not bad and I was on my way out of town which had time to spare anyway. The lack of accommodations and poor customer service weren't even a problem since the airfare was inexpensive. But on the way home, our flight was at 1 am. Already an inconvenient time but again because it was a cheap flight we thought it could still work. The flight got delayed on the way back as well. After speaking with other airport employees I realize that this is a common theme with this company, caused by under staffing, not ""malfunctions with the plane."" This time the flight was delayed for three hours, which caused us to miss our connecting flight. At the airport in Nevada the staff informed us that there were no flights back to Boston for more than 48 hours, and that we should take our original flight into Dallas and look for another flight to Boston from there. They told us ""Don't worry about it right now, they will take care of you there."" Upon arriving in Dallas, they again informed us the there were no flights with their airline leaving to go to Boston, but they would put us in a hotel until they could get us on a flight. Unfortunately, I was not able to accept their offer, because I had three daughters at home waiting for my arrival, that would have been left home alone if I was not there. While I understand that my situation is not their problem specifically and they did somewhat attempt to resolve the situation, that does not excuse the fact that I paid Spirit Airlines to bring my party from point A to point B and they failed to do so. They should have made every attempt within their power to get me back home, including making a deal with another airline as there were other flights going to Boston that day. Not only were they unwilling to make their best efforts to get us home, but they were unwilling to refund the money spent only for the way home. They wanted to give us a pro-rated refund for the mileage minus the flight to Dallas, even though they were the ones that told us to take the flight in the first place because we would ""be taken care of there."" We were forced to pay inflated rates to book a last minute flight. After spending an additional $982.00 for our new flight to Boston, spending $267.00 in overpriced airport food, wasting our time stuck in an airport unable to shower, Spirit Airlines refunded $0. The following day they sent an apology email offering $50.00 off a new flight. What a slap in the face. Why on earth would I choose Spirit Airlines again, when clearly even with the low prices, I end up spending a lot more? Further more, from a business perceptive, if I agree to provide a service to someone and they pay me ahead of time, if for any reason I am unable to complete the job, I'm not going to refund a portion of their payment. I'm going to pay a subcontractor to finish the job. You will end up paying more in the long run.",-1

After all my explanation they only told me: ""We are going to call you back"" I was about to ask something and they just hung up on me.

You're thinking ""wow, 325 dollars for 3 one way tickets."" Only bad part is that you have to have a 7 hour layover in Dallas. Worth it, right? Wrong! Before you make the mistake I did, let me stop you there. I had read horrible reviews about the company but a friend told us that Spirit Airlines was a great company,  that the tickets were super cheap. Well that's because they charge you for carry-on and checked in luggage. Not to mention the fact that I have to pay to check my luggage in again when I get to Dallas. To fly thru Spirit, I am paying a total of 525.00 for 3 one way tickets with a layover of 7 hours. Every airline I have ever flown with, the luggage weight limit is 50lbs, except Spirit, where its 40 lbs. In the end you spend the same about that you would with other airlines, except with other airlines, you get free food, water, and drinks, you get a check in limit of 50lbs with a 20 dollar fee and they don't charge you for your carry on.

Flew from Denver to Las Vegas. I bought my ticket on CheapTickets but later ended up paying for my seat and carry on, I ended up spending what I thought I had saved by buying the cheapest plane ticket. Spirit Airlines charges for every single thing before and during their flights. Of course Spirit offers you the option of many different discount programs which will possibly save you money in the long run but if you are flying just once a year as I do those discount programs will only make you spend more. The only free bag Spirit Airlines will allow you is small purse or backpack. I was only going on vacation for two days and obviously didn't have a lot of things with me and I ended up paying for my carry on. You will not see any TVs or any other entertainment onboard. Spirit also doesn't offer any courtesy drinks. I have to note that the flight attendants were great but that's the only good thing I can tell you about Sprint. If you are trying to save some money do not use Spirit. They also don't issue any refunds unless you cancel your flight seven days before your scheduled trip.

The flight was delayed until 3 from a 1:42 original departure. I got an email notification and everything. They also changed the gate. So while sitting at the new gate I found it odd that at 2:30 the plane still wasn't there. Come to find out the gate was changed to the original gate and the departure time was brought back up to 2:30. By the time I realized these changes I missed my flight. The customer service then yelled at my brother and I and were very unwilling to assist. We got booked on another plane arriving at my destination 5 and a half hours after my original flight. My eight month old nephew and my sister are stuck there waiting for us to get there as the rental car is in my brothers name. However now that flight is delayed by 3 hours.

After all extra fees for things like guaranteeing that you can sit next to you 9 yr old on the ride, paying ridiculous baggage fees for any type of overages (including carry on) and check in fees if you forget to do it online, the cost is the same as flying a non discount airline. Make sure that your bag weighs less than 40 lbs, or that's another $30-$55 on top of what you already paid online. Departure flight was delayed 1 hour, and they demand that you get to the airport 2 hours in advance. Therefore, we sat 3 plus hours in the airport waiting to leave.

An airline's most important goals for customers are to arrive safely and on time. Spirit Airlines fails on goal number 2, to be on time. There is nothing wrong with the actual business model itself with unbundling products, but low cost tickets should not be associated with perpetual lateness. I have traveled this route many times and I am consistently disappointed in the delays in departure and arrival. It is not right to pay full fare (no matter how low) for under delivering to customers. I have repeatedly made the mistake of going back to Spirit in the last year hoping for an improvement, but see none. I am ignorant for not improving on my judgement when deciding on airlines. After this, I am improving my judgement. In the long run, this lack of punctuality will doom this company as competitors will be able to compete.",-1

Then they gave us 3 options: another flight in the other day in the morning, refund, or a credit with Spirit. We knew that the credit was a scam because the fees are very high in the end. We called the Spirit office and waited for 25' for them to say they'd process the refund. I just found the service horribly unjust. If we have taken the flight in the other morning we'd have lost 6 hours in the airport, $140 of our hotel (in our destination), plus $60 on commute and $40 on dinner: total of $240 for the couple.

The SWA flight was delayed leaving NOLA, landed in San Diego - cancelled flight and had to spend most of the night in at airport. The 12 of us made it to Oakland, on time and hassle free. Same situation coming home, it was easy. Yes, we did experience a delay and sat for one hour before take off, but what airline does not experience the same issue? I dislike that you have to pay to carry a ""larger"" item on to the plane. In most cases, I have never paid to take a carry on and just walk right on. Let them select your seat, and you just need to say ""NO"" to all extras to continue with your reasonably priced ticket. So what if you have to pay for water or a coke? If that is all you have to complain about, then pay a few hundred dollars extra and fly another airline.  I just refuse to let someone dig as deep as possible into my pockets for the same service.",1

Spirit cancelled my 7PM flight due to ""weather"", it rained for about 30 mins and moved on. The counter agent and manager offered to put me on the ""first available"" flight home, 2 days later. Since it was weather related, no hotel, no meals, nothing. Also, Spirit doesn't have agreements with other airlines so they won't put you on a different carrier, only refund your remaining leg and leave you stranded. A one way flight home last min would cost me another $700. The agents, the manager, no help, they just don't care and it shows in their attitude. What a terrible company.

2016-07-26,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MSP to LAX,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5.0,experience with Spirit was very nice,False,"  My friend and I recently traveled with Spirit Airlines from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. Before departure I read some reviews about the airline and became worried about the type of service we would receive. Contrary to the numerous negative reviews, by experience with Spirit was very nice. A round trip ticket from Minneapolis to Los Angeles was around $150 for myself. Charging $55 for a carry on bag seemed steep, but in the long run it was more cost effective than purchasing a normal ticket from a different airline. The seats didn't recline, but it was only a three hour trip so it wasn't bad. Since the seats didn't recline I didn't have to worry about having less leg room because of the person sitting in front of me. There were no in-flight movies or food, but on other airlines half of the time the movies don't work and the food is terrible. Spirit does have food for purchase in-flight, but I chose to purchase food at the airport before we left. Our in-flight crew was wonderful, and one of the members did a funny skit about how to properly use the bathroom and how to behave while sitting in our seats (some people even clapped when he was done). Our flight out departed at the right time (which has not happened with other airlines that I have flown!). Our flight back departed an hour and a half late, but more often than not delays are due to air traffic control. If you are looking for a cheap flight, and your flight time is not very long, I would highly recommend using Spirit Airlines. Be sure to either purchase your carry-on baggage online when you book your tickets, or when you print your boarding pass at the airport check-in terminal. I paid $55 for my carry-on when I printed my boarding pass during check-in. If you reach the gate without paying for you carry-on you may be charged up to $100. Plan ahead, download some music and movies onto your phone/iPod, and your flight with Spirit will be just fine.",1

We all go to ticketing to check our options and instead of letting us know right away that the first 15 or so people will have better luck getting on the next morning flight-they wait a half hour and scream it - this entire process was tedious and very frustrating, especially considering that the person I'm supposed to visit will be overseas for the next year. I understand that these people are just doing their job, however the way they go about it was one of the most frustrating things to witness.

We were addressed at the refund counter that our plane could not have access to a gate for passengers to board. Consequently, we were financially unable to book on another flight due to the high cost and extreme inconvenience. We booked with Spirit due to the price and reliability of their service and feel extremely let down with this scenario. A plane unable to board its passengers due to a lack of gate availability.

My second experience with Spirit, if I have my choice it will also be my last. Started our family vacation to Costa Rica at BWI. The check in process was a total failure. Their website constantly bombards you to check in online or face additional charges. What they don't inform you is that for all international flights you must check in and have boarding passes re-printed at the counter anyway. Every single staff member we encountered had an attitude and was just irritated with any and all questions from passengers. Not a single hello or greeting of any kind. For this I paid extra for checked in bags and seat assignments. Our flight consisted of a total of 4 legs having a stop over in Fort Lauderdale each way so not only did I pay for 4 separate seat assignments but we had the experience of being at least 1 hour late on each leg. The portion from Ft. Lauderdale to Costa Rica being 5 hours late. The flight from Ft.Laurderdale to Costa Rica was the worse of the bunch. We arrive in Ft. Lauderdale 1 hour late, with a 2 hour layover. We boarded the plane, after the doors closed, we all sat in the plane for almost an hour not moving. The captain finally announces that the plane was having mechanical issues hence the wait. After another 30 minutes the captain comes back on the announcement and informs us that the plane cannot be repaired and we need to disembark for another plane. While in the plane for almost 90 minutes not a single offer of drinks or snacks. Not a single flight attendant tried to comfort the passengers or try to keep us updated on the status. Back at the gate and continued to wait some more, Spirit finally locates another airplane, a smaller one with about 50 less seats. They announce that this plane is smaller and that some passengers will not be able to continue. Imagine the panic. With the typical chaotic Spirit boarding process, passengers rushed the gates. Those of us who paid for assigned seats were out of luck. Attendants inform me that due to the smaller plane, seat assignments were no longer enforced. With the smaller plane finally full, with slower passengers were waiting to board, Spirit attendants, make a desperate plea for voluntary 10 passengers to surrender their seats or the plane will not take off. 5 passenger take the offer for a free hotel leaving 5 more. No additional passengers were willing to surrender their seats, the crew hold those of us already seated hostage and refuse to depart. After another hour of waiting, the pilot then realizes that he has timed out and can no longer pilot this plane to Costa Rica. Spirit then orders all passenger to yet again disembark the plane while they find another pilot. Total wait on this leg, 5 hours. Spirit has the worse customer service of any airline.",-1

Flight was supposed to leave at 8:55 it is 10:37 and we have yet to even board. I did not even recieve an email notification as to why we were being delayed. I asked the gentleman at the desk and he was not sure either. I asked when the flight was getting in and he wasn't sure. I will never fly with Spirit again with all the extra charges they rack on, horrible customer service and lack of knowledge. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices, your better off paying more, I promise.",-1

They charge excessive amounts, allow less weight and even charge for carry on luggage that others allow for free. Our baggage charges cost more than our actual flights from LA to Vegas and they weren't the cheapest either. Just happened to have a more convenient flight time on the day we chose to fly out, but ended up paying dearly for that. Never again will we be caught out.",-1

2016-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to BWI,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,still had to check in with an agent,False,"  Spirit Airline is a great deal if - 1) you are traveling alone 2) no luggage except a purse/backpack 3) have patience level of a saint 4) a meticulous planner 5) someone small, not afraid of small spaces. At the end of the day, it's my fault for not doing research beforehand about this airline. My husband and I along with our 8 month old traveled from Chicago to Baltimore to visit family. We decided on Spirit Airline due to its low cost ($200/ticket). We booked this trip far in advance and the downside of purchasing tickets so far in advance is that unexpected things can happen. Something came up and I called Spirit Airline to request a return flight change, from morning flight to evening flight. I was told that it would cost me $500 to change from morning to evening flight. Obviously I declined this. Purchasing two new return tickets would only cost me $200 ($100 each way from BWI to ORD). We checked in online, printed the tickets and guess what? We still had to check in with an agent. We waited 30 mins for our departure flight and our return flight just to check in with an agent. Despite being at the airport at 4.00am, we barely made it to our 6.30 am flight. The security line wasn't even that bad compared to the check in line at Spirit.",-1

The next flights available were hours and days later which didnt work because we had a connecting flight in Los Angeles later in the evening. We paid for the upgraded seats 2A and 2B and baggage but I must have received 3-4 emails prior to the flight trying to get me to upgrade however I already had. The agents at the airport were bickering with each other and not helping with baggage etc. Very unprofessional and no customer solutions. I later had to call customer relations and the call center staff had very poor English skills. Very poor business practices and horrible customer service.,-1

2016-07-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DFW to TPA,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,flight was cancelled,False,"  I had booked from DFW to Tampa Florida. Arrived 2 hours early at DFW airport, they said there was going to be a delay of an hour. After that it was delayed an hour when they said it was cancelled. They sent us to a different gate to rebook to Orlando FL. So after an hour waiting we boarded the plane. After sitting onboard for about 30 minutes they said we had to get off the plane because the engine wasn't working. So we walked to a different gate to get on board a different plane. We waited for them to get the plane ready for about an hour and then they told us the flight was cancelled. So they gave us a phone number to call to rebook it for another day. I was there from 6am-1pm.",-1
2016-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to STT via FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,friendly but understaffed,False,"  Flew from Ft Lauderdale to St Thomas. Our family of 4 arrived at the airport 1.5 hours ahead of our scheduled departure time as recommended. Spirit's counter was friendly but understaffed which resulted in time lost. Now running late our family proceeded to the gate once we each got through security in hopes of getting seats together on the plane. Two of our family members arrived at the gate five minutes behind the first two. The terminal attendant had just closed the door to the jet-walk after only 2 of our 4 had board. Another 8 passengers were also at the gate after the jet-walk door had closed. The plane was still connected to the jet-walk and was still 5 minutes before the scheduled departure time but the door to the jet-walk was closed. No one from Spirit Airlines, either on the plane or in the terminal would allow the 10 passengers onto the plane even though it was minutes before the scheduled departure. The plane was not full. To add further insult to this situation the plane arrived at its destination 30 minutes early and had to wait on the tarmac because it was early.",-1
2016-07-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,MGA to SAN via FLL-IAH,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,claustrophobic and uncomfortable,False,"  Spirit Airlines is only good for weekend trips and flight duration no longer than 90 min. The seats are very cramped, I am a short person (5'3"") and I found them very claustrophobic and uncomfortable. And once in flight, you are not even given a glass of water, no matter have sick you are. But my worst experience was on my flight home, my route was Managua-Ft. Lauderdale-Houston-San Diego, basically a full day to get home, my flight MGA-FLL was at 1am, so we got at the airport early to check in, and just like the first flight, our flights were not linked, so we had to get them linked at the counter so we wouldn't have to pick up our bags and check in at every stop. This flight left on time to FLL, where we had a 12-13 hr layover, trust me this airport is not meant for those layovers, finally our 6.40pm flight arrives and it gets a total of 3 hrs delay because they couldn't find a pilot. I had read these stories but didn't believe them completely, but yes, they didn't have a pilot, finally got one that was coming, I think from St. Thomas and we were off to Houston. Luckily our layover was just an hour and it was on the same aircraft, but once we landed at IAH, we were informed that the flight to SAN was cancelled. So we had to deplane at almost midnight to go to the Spirit counter and see what would happen, that was a 4 hour wait to get anything done. By then we got another flight with a more reputable airline, and I got home at 8pm. This company is horrible all the way, I didn't book this flight, because I knew the horrible reputation it has, but definitely I will try to avoid it like the black plague. The person who booked this flight was trying to save money, ended up spending more money even before the cost of the other airline. Cheap things usually end up costing more in the long run.",-1

2016-06-30,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DTW to LAX,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,4.0,have had no problems,False,"  I have been a Spirit $9 fare member for several years and have had no problems, I fly from LAX to DTW a couple times a year to see family. Yes a couple of times they weren't on time but never over a half hour late. I flew this past Saturday June 25. the 8.15pm flight, it was a new plane, very nice and yes you should know that Spirit seats do not recline but for 4-4.5 hr flights that is no problem. I always check my bags for $21 and my carry on is free that I put under the seat and I carry my purse. The flight attendants kept checking on people and they asked me twice if I wanted more ice for my drink.",1
2016-06-29,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SAN to DEN,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,flight attendant upgraded me at no charge,False,"  Flew from San Diego to Denver. The one upside of my trip with Spirit (and I mean the only one) came in the form of a no-charge in-airplane upgrade from a middle seat to an exit row seat. I'm a big guy (6'4, 215 ) and I think the flight attendant took pity on my cramped conditions. Booking: The process was easy enough, until I had to work through the myriad of upsell pages Spirit.com shoved on me. I liked the transparent, almost flippant approach to how they broke out the total ticket price (ie. ""Government's Cut,"" ""Security Fee,"" etc...) but really disliked having to click through multiple ""Buy Add-on's Here!"" pages just to buy my ticket. Online Check-In: Terrible. The system continued giving me error messages and wouldn't let me sign in with my account, which I created a week prior, I finally gave up and signed up for a new account with a new email address. Once I finally got in, I had to go through several more up-sell pages trying to encourage me to pay for additional add-ons. In Airport-Boarding: Boarding was straight-forward, but frustrating as the boarding agents continued allowing individuals to board ahead of their assigned boarding group. I was in Group 2, and boarded behind several individuals in groups 3 and 4 who didn't want to wait until their group was called. The boarding agents let them through ahead of their boarding group with no hassle. On-Plane: The plane was about 90% full, and a flight attendant upgraded me at no charge to an Exit Row seat. This was the only bright spot in a very frustrating Spirit Airlines experience. The seats themselves were your normal airplane seats, but these appeared to have very little cushioning and started to become quite uncomfortable about 20 minutes into the flight. About 1 1/2 hours into the flight, I asked the flight attendant for a glass of tap water, and was told they only had bottled water for $3 each. Deplaning: Nothing special about the deplaning experience. Just like every other airline here. Overall: Spirit Airlines bills themselves as an ""Ultra-Low Cost"" carrier, but unless you are flying with nothing but the clothes on your back, you will quickly find the low cost does not exist. Expect to pay a pretty penny for creature comforts like water, carry-on bags, and checked luggage. By spending a little more, you can fly with a respectable carrier who treats you like a valued customer.",-1
2016-06-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,ATL to MSP,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,not worth my time or money,False,"  I drove 3 hours to Atlanta airport and arrived at 3am, I wanted to check in earlier because I knew that Atlanta airport gets really busy. My flight was supposed to leave at 10.41am which was perfect enough time for me to get back to Minneapolis to work. Unfortunately it is currently 1.14am and the airplane has finally arrived. But guess what, it landed on the opposite side of the gate that it should've landed on. After standing in line for 10 mins we found out that the plane is delayed again. Now my flight is not departing until 3pm. That is 12 hours I have been at this airport. Very inconvenient. We all have a life to attend to and sitting around waiting for a plane is not part of it. Never again will I fly with Spirit Airlines. It is not worth my time or money.",-1
2016-06-28,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to ORD,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,plane still departed on time,False,"  People who complain about Spirit are people who are looking for a full flying experience. Spirit was cheap, and if you properly take your time to read, you would see that if you pay online for your checked bag or carry on you save money and if you print out your boarding pass at home takes 2 minutes and saves money. Take an empty water bottle if you don't want to pay $3 for water. You don't have to pay for a seat if you let Spirit randomly assign where you sit when you print out your boarding pass. I fly alone so this isn't a problem. And if you want to sit beside a friend/family member, seats are only $8 to guarantee you sit together. Unless you are a very tall or wide person, the seats are completely fine. There's no movies or Wifi but take a book to read or play a game on your phone. The plane was extremely clean, the staff was friendly and willing to help, flights were on time - some even leaving a little early. Boarding was pushed back slightly but the plane still departed on time (actually a few minutes early). Bottom line: if you are looking for a cheap and clean way to get from point A to point B, I 100% recommend flying with Spirit.",1
2016-06-27,0.3,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LAS to SEA,3.0,,3.0,,,5.0,1.0,should have read the reviews,False,"  I recommend no one purchase a flight with Spirit Airlines. Unless you plan on traveling with one small personal carry on (purse, backpack). I should have read the reviews before booking this flight from Las Vegas to Seattle. A $200 per person flight ended up costing about $400 per person once all the extra fees where added on after the initial purchase for a non refundable ticket.

Before I flew, I saw many reviews from other passengers that flew with the airline before, and I was expecting the worst, but they surprised me. The airplane was very clean and neat, also the crew were fantastic and enthusiastic, we took off on time. In addition it only took 1.50 hours from LAX to PDX instead of the 2.30 hour usual flight time. I can add that although it has 28 inches of pitch, seats were comfortable.",1

2016-06-21,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SJD to IAH,2.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5.0,flight was uneventful,False,"  This is an all economy airline and if you want anything more you have to pay for it. This airline doesn't make you pay for a share of those seats that are in first class because there is no first class. There isn't a lot of room for seating, hardly any padding in the seats and they don't recline. If you want to snack on the plane you better bring it with you or whip out your credit card cause they don't take cash. The flight attendants were nice and helpful and the flight from San Jose to Houston was uneventful. I don't need all the frills the other airlines offer so for me its just a way to get from point a to point b. Next time I fly with them I will bring something to pad the metal bar in the seat back. We checked our bags and we had to wait probably 15 or 20 minutes longer than what we consider usual after going through customs and immigration.",1

The airline claims to be the discount option, but they try to monetize every single aspect of the flight, which can make the flight just as expensive as a decent carrier. The aircraft themselves are small and uncomfortable, and the customer service is the worst I've experienced. I would sooner walk to my destination than fly Spirit Airlines again.",-1

2016-06-17,1.0,Business,Economy Class,DTW to LGA,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,would actually like to commend them,False,"  A quick one day business trip to New York, turned out to be an involuntary two day trip, due to a cancelled flight as a result of mechanical problems. While every one else will probably blame the airline for poor service, I would actually like to commend them. As a budget airline, they did far more than I would have expected them to do. They had around 200 irate customers to deal with, but they handled each and every one with respect and the utmost of patience, even though a lot of frustration bubbled over at times. Yes, the line was long and the wait even longer, but that was more the fault of each passenger taking time to decide. The outcome was that they provided me with a hotel room, a return transfer to the hotel plus food vouchers. All of these by far surpassed the value of my very basic fare ticket. They did this with a smile and a desk team that stayed on until every single passenger had been accommodated. Airlines all have the same functions, but what distinguishes one from the other is how they deal with problems. For me, Spirit deserves a 10 out of 10 for the way they handled this situation. People often lose perspective - you choose Spirit because you want an affordable option between point A and B. Technical problems happen. Delays happen. And yes, you pay for every extra bit. That is good though, because it puts the choices back into our hands, as the consumer. I would use them again.",1
2016-06-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BOG to DFW,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,do not make the same mistake,False,"  Traveling with Spirit can become a nightmare: delays, technical issues, personnel with very poor sense of customer service, and no one with authority to help is what you buy when trying to save a few dollars. My wife and I booked a round trip Dallas–Bogota-Dallas with one stop in Ft Lauderdale. Our initial trip to Bogota was ok, on the contrary, our trip back to the U.S was really bad. We had an hour delay in Bogota due to air traffic, however, we arrived to Ft Lauderdale with a one hour window to make our connection to Dallas. Even though we had limited time, we thought we could make the connection considering we did not have checked bags to be waiting for. We rushed to from the airplane to Immigration, once we reached immigration, officials asked us to wait in a separate line due to technical errors presented exclusively by Spirit Airlines. After 35 minutes a member of Spirit was able to communicate to the gate by radio confirming that the gate was still open. He gave us directions and asked us to run to the gate. Despite the delay in Immigration, we managed to arrive at the gate 5 minutes prior to the time, however, no one was at the gate. We approached the representative on the next gate who said there was nothing she could do. At that time the airplane was still parked at the gate. At another gate a representative booked us onto a flight scheduled to depart 24 hours later. We went to the Spirit Counter where we had to wait for about 55 minutes to talk to a supervisor. The only thing the supervisor did was blame 'air traffic'. To make things worse she gave us a list of hotels where we were supposed to get 40 to 50% discount for being a 'Spirit Customer'. We called several hotels and non of them offer discounts for us. We spent the night in Ft Lauderdale and traveled back home 24 hours later. This situation is not an isolated case, at least 4 family members and friends had lost their connection in the last 4 weeks. Trying to save a few dollars we lost a day of work, spent money in food and transportation and were put in a lot of stress. Please do not make the same mistake we did buying tickets with Spirit.",-1

When I tell you that Spirit Airlines is the worst airline that I have flown I mean it. Yes, they have cheap fares, but cheap isn't always better when you're being charged as much as $50 for checked luggage. The seats on the plane do not recline and they charge you for onboard snacks, they basically charge you for everything. Do yourself a favor and fly one of the major airlines such as American, United or Southwest to avoid a disappointment.",-1
2016-06-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to FLL,1.0,,2.0,,,4.0,1.0,you might be late or never arrive,False,"  Flew Spirit Airlines from Orlando, FL - Fort Lauderdale, FL - San Jose, Costa Rica and return. Aside from some nice employees we encountered, everything else about this flight was just horrible. We waited for 20 minutes after boarding, then an announcement was made that there was a dent in the plane, 20 minutes later they announced that it was taking longer than expected to fix and we could get off the plane if we wanted to. As we were getting off they made a 3rd announcement that we would miss our connecting flight and would have to stay the night in Fort Lauderdale then fly out the next day. Finally almost an hour later they announce that the plane would not be able to fly. After 30 more minutes, they announce that a new plane would be coming, but wait, this new plane could only fit 178 people and our current plane had 219 passengers. They told us that more than half the plane could go ahead and board the new aircraft, but the rest of us would have to figure out what we were going to do. We could volunteer to give up our flight and switch it to the next available or check with an attendant to see what other options and flights there were. If we had decided to take the option for volunteering to take a new flight, then we would have had to fly to Houston TX from Orlando with a huge layover and finally end up in Costa Rica (our final destination) at midnight the next day. That's if nothing else happened, we would have missed a whole day of our trip. With so much chaos and confusion, my husband and I decided to take the 4 hour drive from Orlando to Fort Lauderdale. After waiting 2 hours for our luggage, we finally left the airport at 2.30 am EST, after arriving at 7.00 pm EST. Then after arriving at Fort Lauderdale airport at around 6.30ish am EST, our flight did not leave until 10.40 am EST. My husband and I fly pretty frequently and I have never encountered any of these issues before, let alone all of them at the same time. You get a great price when flying with Spirit but you also take a chance that you might be late or never arrive.",-1

Printed boarding passes at hotel when leaving for airport. Boarding passes listed one hour delay and Gate change. Arrived at airport, ate a meal, went to gate to find out the flight was on-time and changed back to original gate. Went to original gate to find passengers lined up to board at 4.00 pm. Waiting to board received a delayed notice because of maintenance issues (Maintenance issue announced three times) we were finally called to board plane. As I stepped onto the plane, a thunder and lightning storm started and we sat on the plane for approx. 1.5 hours as flights were grounded and airport was closed. Finally when flight was ok for take-off passengers with connecting flights to LA realized that we were going to miss our connecting flights, asked flight attendants for advice. They had no information. We were told to get off the plane and get instructions from the gate attendants. Finally attendants gave limited info that we could get off and get a flight the next day with no accommodation or we could fly on and get the next flight out of LA to Oakland. Arrived in LA and missed our connecting flight by 15 min. All passengers who missed connecting flight were told to go to the gate to make arrangements. We were told not to wait in line and go to the side to be helped by the next agent. Once we talked to an agent we were told that there were no flights until the next morning. We asked about accommodation and were told there was none because it was a storm issues. I asked to speak to supervisor. Supervisor would not accommodate us. Through frustration I with my 2 traveling companions chose to take a refund and we rented a car and drove 5 hours home. The customer service through this experience was horrible and unacceptable. It may be a cheap flight but you shouldn't get a cheap service in return.",-1

Needless to say our flight was cancelled so we had to get a hotel room for the day until our flight was scheduled to leave the following night (getting us home at 6am on the 13th). That flight was cancelled as well so we were stuck in Vegas for 2 additional days and Spirit wants to offer travel vouchers? There's no way I will fly this airline again. We literally had to beg them to put us on a different airline and they refused to compensate us for what we are out of because of their lack of employees to cover 2 flights.,-1

I flew from Los Angeles to Kansas with no issue, however coming back was a nightmare. I was informed at around my scheduled take off time that my flight was delayed two hours. After hour in a half wait, was then informed that it was cancelled. The next possible flight was the next day, and had an 5 hour layover when my flight was a non stop flight. Customer service was rude, and not helpful at all with trying to accommodate me. The agent's accent was so hard to understand that it was so frustrating. Since my flight was rebooked, they have already notified me that this new flight is now delayed. Don't go with Spirit Airlines. I read the reviews and still took a chance.",-1

Checked or carrying bags are an extra charge ($40-45 a piece). They prompt you to choose your seat for an extra cost, and when they cancel your flight, they casually send you an email that says ""a change had been made to your flight, either a delay or cancellation."" In my case, there were no additional flights out the same day. The reason for the cancellation was ""air traffic congestion"" - whatever that means and the offer they gave me was Wednesday morning. This is unacceptable for any professional trying to get to work on time. I had no choice but to switch carriers and get home at a decent time. The only nice thing was I didn't have to fight for my full refund. This experience with Spirit has made me never want to deal with them again.",-1

Deceptive advertising and poor customer service. Beware, After you purchase you airfare, you'll find out you still have to pay for your seat assignments which can cost from $6 to $25 per seat. Then there is the luggage, $35 for the 1st piece (only 40lbs) provided you add it online ahead of time. However its $50 if you call them to add it or pay at check in. Their website would not allow me to add it online requiring me to call them, and after 30 minutes they still refused to add it over the phone for the $35.00 regardless of the glitches with their website. And carry-on's? Yes, they charge for them as well, and if you wait to pay for the carry-on until you are at the gate, it costs $100. (for the carry-on?). One lady only had cash which they would not accept and they required her to put the contents in a clear plastic bag and then leave the luggage behind? They explained the reasons were to control the weight on the plane. Yet she was able to take the contents? Also: if you wait to check in and get your boarding pass at the counter it costs $10.00 per person. Seats, do not recline, mainly because they are so close together. No drinks or snacks were offered.",-1

I fly all over the world for work and personal events. This trip was personal. Our flight was 2.5 hours late getting started. Reason given was late leaving Dallas. See my other review of their atrociously awful seats. Then we land and leave Minneapolis. As we are approaching Denver we are told we have to circle for a couple hours due to bad weather. Strange, since the other airline websites show all flights close to on time. When we get on the ground finally, we find people there who have been there more than 30 hours, due to cancelled flights on Spirit Airlines. They will be on our flight to Vegas. All other flights here in Denver are gone and on time. So they knew they were having problems before I even got to the airport this morning. As of this review I have been flying and/or sitting in an airport for over 12 hours for a 5 hours flight. They call themselves a cheap, low cost airline. By the time you've spent more than you would have on a real carrier you realize cheap means very low quality. I will never fly this airline again.",-1
2016-06-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,LAX to BWI,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,first and last time with Spirit,False,"  Spirit Airlines is the worst airline I have flown. Flew from Los Angeles to Baltimore. They charge for every little thing they can, so getting a true discount is a complete camouflage. I went to the customer service desk to check-in one duffle style bag, the young lady ensured me my bag was fine as a carry on if I was able to fit my small purse inside of it, which I did. The bag charge at check-in is $50.00 per bag. Right before I boarded the gentleman told me my bag was oversized and I needed to pay $100 to board the plane. I explained what happened when I initially checked in and requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor was very non caring and brushed me off immediately. He told me he'll speak to the young lady and charged me $65.00 dollars instead. With the additional $15.00 I spent to get a window seat and $65.00 for a standard bag, I could have flown a more quality airline, which I will next time. I will never fly with Spirit again. I should have read more reviews before I booked a flight with them. By far this has been the worst display of customer service I've experienced. No complimentary anything, not even a beverage service with a small glass of water was free. Seats didn't even recline, not comfortable at all. This was my first and last time dealing with Spirit.",-1

People just aren't doing their research before flying. Yes there are a lot of extra fees but you have to calculate if they are worth it. The cheap ticket is worth the flight of you calculate how much in total it will be with the bags. Print your tickets at home as well. The leg room is not all the bad and I am 6 foot 2 inches tall. Know the fees and calculate the total price and then fly. This airline can be really good if you know what you are doing.,1

Spirit's instructions were to arrive 2 hours before the original flight time. I tried calling customer support and could not get past the automated voice. I then tried calling Spirit at Philadelphia airport with a message that the mailbox was full. This delay precludes the reason for going on this trip, making it useless and expensive. Cheap flights? Yes. Delays happen but customer support should not be non-existent if this is their mode of operation. I will never fly Spirit because it has cost me more money than a major airline.",-1

It took them six hours to decide to cancel our flight although the plane had arrived and was visible from the gate from before it was scheduled for boarding. Furthermore the crew stated that it was not the case that the crew would time out by the time they arrived in Chicago. Absolutely unacceptable. They made absolutely no attempt to honor their contract of carriage and make accommodations through other airlines. Perhaps they don't even codeshare but their lack of attempt to reschedule any of their passengers was absolutely deplorable. Shortly after the flight is scheduled to arrive Spirit Airlines sends out a survey for feedback.

However, after the flight was delayed twice (changed on the board, never announced) the flight was cancelled. The passengers were only told to go to the ticket counter to resolve any flight issues. No other information was given. At the counter we were told that the next available flight would be in 3 days - Saturday 5/28. No accommodations were made for anyone. Persons trying to fly home were not given hotel vouchers, no attempts were made to try and find alternative flights. I have never experienced such poor customer service from any airline. I received a full refund for my flight (although I have yet to be credited on my credit card). I attempted to find another flight with another airline but due to the short notice the airfare was extremely high and i was forced to cancel my trip.",-1

I had to spend $100 on a hotel, then another $100 on transportation from San Diego to Los Angeles because they refused to help in any way. $200 out of my pocket which is money that I don't have just to be informed that they could have helped me get to Los Angeles but refused to do so.",-1

I would never fly Spirit again. They delayed my first flight by 3 hours which then made me miss my Spirit connecting flight to Oakland and had no other flight for me to connect to.

Before placing judgment on a company, I like to give them the benefit of the doubt, this leading me to purchase of return flight tickets via Spirit. I am very disappointed with the service received during what was supposed to be a very short trip from Atlanta to Detroit. As with many flights, our departing gate was switched. Which is harmless enough, except it was never updated at the gate, leading many individuals from other flights to wait at ours, which was incorrect and inconvenient for them. Once we boarded the plane, we then proceeded to sit on the plane for an hour. In 20 minutes, they read the names of 10 people, asked them to grab their things and exit te flight. It took 40 minutes for us to be updated on the cause, that Spirit had oversold the flight and they had to figure out what to do. Part of that involved pulling people off the plane (some who had booked months in advance), without explanation. It took another 15 minutes for them to allow those individuals back on the plane. Following which 10 more minutes passed, during which they realized there was still one more seat open and they sought to fill it. It is unbelievable the poor communication and service provided by this airline. I guess for an airline that charges for everything once you step on that plane, good customer service definitely isn't included. Will never use their services again.",-1

Flight was on-time, aircraft was clean and only a few minor hiccups. Our plane arrive 15 minutes late, but the crew made up most of the delay in turn-around time and flight time. Cabin crew was pleasant but the new normal of salty at best. Companies should be ashamed of how they ""beat down"" their employees, any cabin crew over the age of 30 have been salty to say the least.

2016-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to DTW,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,very rude employees,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Detroit with Spirit Airlines. We got to the terminal for our 820pm flight at approx 545pm. We checked in, got our boarding passes and checked the board for our flight. Our 820pm flight was delayed until 930pm. We were then instructed to get into a huge line in order to check our bags. The line was so long that it went outside and down the sidewalk. It took a little over an hour just to check our bags, and then we still had to go through security. When we finally got up to the front in order to check our bags, we were informed that not only had our boarding gate changed, but our flight was now delayed until 1015pm. We went to our gate and waited. After about an hour, they made an announcement that our gate had been changed to one  on the other side of the terminal. So, with about 50 other grumbling people, we walked to the new gate, and waited. They made an announcement that we were waiting on a couple of flight attendants to get there from another flight and that we'd start boarding as soon as they did their safety check. Finally at about 9pm we started boarding. You would think that's where our troubles would end, but no. We landed in Detroit at 1210am, then it took us 20 minutes to get to the terminal and get off the plane. Then another long walk down to baggage claim. We get to baggage claim 2 and we waited. All around us, people were starting to sit down in the middle of the floor. After 1h 10m there was announcement saying that the carousel with our baggage would now be at number 6. So we all get up, walk down to carousel number 6, and wait another 20 minutes before our baggage finally started coming up. Then we still had to get a shuttle to the hotel to get our car, and then drive 40 minutes to get home. So a trip that should have been approx. 6 hours ended up being almost 9 hours. This is absolutely outrageous considering that it's only a 2.5 hour flight. Not only that, but we also had to deal with a lot of very rude employees. Is it because the customers are disgruntled by all of the waiting and delayed/cancelled flights taking it out on them? The entire airline needs to be more organized and way more efficient. If you choose to fly Spirit, I wish you the best.",-1

I had the cash to pay for it and also had a credit card from the UK but neither was acceptable under company policy. The steward on duty came over when all seemed lost to me and offered me a drink and a cake at his expense.

On the way from Philadelphia to Los Angeles a week earlier (Flight NK267, April 20 2016, Zone 2, Seat 1D) I was in a similar situation but was similarly treated by the stewardess on duty who gave me a cup of coffee and a sandwich and would not accept payment for it.",1

I checked in early to get a somewhat decent seat (like I did for my upcoming flight tomorrow from Denver to Chicago by setting an alarm for 24 hours to check in) and get a seat at the back of the plane in the middle. Trust me, my standards for a seat are not that high. I can get passed the fact they don't recline, or my back is mangled after a less than 2 hr flight, the $50 carry on fee, the slow lines at the counter, etc.. And I get that they are upfront about costs overall, but this particularly makes me angry because they charge you $18 to move your seat from the middle at the kiosk. It's just another way to make you miserable enough to extract a little more money out of you. By the time you make this flight somewhat bearable you could have flown Southwest and got a snack, Internet, and 2 free bags. They call it ""random"" seating, but how is it that every time I chose this option I always get the middle in the back? Isn't there only about a 1/3 chance you'd get that? Why has this happened the last 3 times I've flown them? Not very ""random"" Spirit. You will not get another dime out of me.",-1

I don't object to their Ryanair-type methods. I've flown Ryanair in Europe, no problem. $3 for a soda? Could care less. $2 for crackers? So what? Window seat charge?  What I object to is, despite their claims, they are not transparent and upfront. For example, their $9 membership, isn't $9, it's $59. At the end of the arduous online experience when you're trying to book your ticket (and after shutting down that $9 club window numerous times), you receive a summary of costs and you must pay it now. There's no option to say ""no"" don't need or want this or that, and then pay. So, for example, most online sites when providing a summary before payment, let you correct any errors. Not Spirit Airlines. You need to go back to the beginning and start all over again. Their marketing gimmick of sending panic notices 2 days before your fight is well-crafted psycho drama. Reserve your seat now or it will cost $100 at the airport! Well, guess what? You don't have to reserve a seat. Guess what, you don't have to pay for one carry-on that sits beneath the seat in front of you. But you just did. This is not about knowing the ropes. It’s about not getting suckered in by an organization that wants to sucker you every step of the way.",-1

Spirit landed in TX, and the next flight was delayed 1.5 hours. Finally boarded the plane, only to be told the flight was being cancelled due to weather. All the New Orleans' passengers had to get off, leaving 4 passengers bound to Ft. Lauderdale. Wouldn't the plane fly over the same/similar air space to go to Florida as it would to go to Nola? So all the Nola passengers deplane and are told there is nothing they can do for us at that time. We can either get only that leg of the trip refunded, or come back in two days and they would try to get us on a plane. I've never heard of an airline abandoning their passengers and not have any options for them.

I was shoved over as I entered the plane by a female flight attendant. She looked straight at me and never said a word, just shoved past me as she closed the overhead baggage compartments.

2016-04-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to LAX,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,never been so uncomfortable,False,"  First and last time flying Spirit Airlines. The flight to Los Angeles was awful. They have no affiliation with TSA precheck, so we waited in a huge, slow line for security. The plane was late arriving, and departed close to an hour late. The seats were so cramped - I am only 5'4"" and my knees were only a couple of inches from the seat in front of me. I've never been so uncomfortable on a plane in my life. The return trip departure was also delayed. This was different model of plane, and it did provide a bit more leg room - by stripping the seats down to metal and a thin layer of padding. The tray table was about the size of a business-sized envelope. Wouldn't fit a food container, a laptop, or even a tall water bottle. It was completely useless. The discomfort is not worth the cost savings. And then Spirit sent me a ""customer satisfaction survey"" after each leg of the flight. I tried to open it both times, on an iPad and a laptop, and there was nothing there - no file to be found. So clearly they don't really want any feedback. I will never fly Spirit again.",-1
2016-04-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGA to DTW,,,,,,1.0,1.0,never fly Spirit again,False,"  I received an email at 12pm today (Sunday, April 24th) saying that my 4:55pm flight from New York to Detroit was cancelled - not delayed or postponed to another time just flat out cancelled. I was on the phone with their customer service for almost 2 hours and talked to 4 different people, I explained that I had a funeral tomorrow morning and needed to get back. They told me they could get me home Tuesday (the 26th) morning or they could refund me the portion that was cancelled but they couldn't give me a full refund to put towards another ticket. I had to pay out of my pocket to get another ticket through a different airline and I still won't make it home to go to the funeral. I will never fly Spirit again. They did nothing to help me, and I still have no idea why the flight was cancelled.",-1

Spirit Airlines are not really cheap also they have a lot of tricks to purchase for the baggage, seats, insurance. Check-in is $10 if you ask to the passenger assistant at the airport. My flight schedule was 6.25pm from Atlanta airport to Dallas. They had an issue with the maintenance for 4 hours. Departure time was changed 6.25pm to 10.15pm. They do not let the passengers know what the reason was. No apologies of course. They do not really update promptly. They don't even give you the water when you are on the plane. Everything is purchase necessary. Their service is not really professional.",-1

Arrived at the airport 3 hours early just for that to be pointless due to the fact that no representative even showed up to start checking people in and getting boarding passes to people until 1.5 hrs prior to takeoff, mind you at this point they have to check in pretty much the whole flight at this point. The plane was at the terminal ready for boarding yet no boarding even began until 5 min prior to scheduled takeoff. The plane finally actually started its taxi 45 mins past original takeoff time and the excuse was that they had messed up the paperwork in the terminal. Also, bags do not fly free, they don't even fly at a reasonable price, thankfully I brought a small personal bag and that's it, otherwise you would pay more for the bag to fly than what I paid for my original ticket. You will not save money with Spirit Airlines and you will be lucky to get wherever you are trying to go on time.",-1

On the way back from Vegas we needed a boarding pass print out so we went to the counter before security check to get the boarding passes, and since the same carry on bag was a little heavy we decided to check it in, the lady at the counter said if we want to check it in it will cost us $50 so we decided to carry it on. At the gate however they said we cannot take it on board it's got to be checked in and that it will cost $200, we made an objection that the lady at the check in counter asked for $50 only why do we have to pay that much now. They refused and forced us to pay $100.  When we were already at the gate boarding, and there was nothing else we could do, but to pay the $100.",-1

Only to have the door literally slammed in my face. I watched as the plane sat for another twenty minutes while I was told I could not board. Customer service was rude and seemed under internal pressure to act in such a way. They did book me on the next flight at no charge. This is my third time flying Spirit and the second horrible experience with the airline. On another flight they canceled it because of weather. It hadn't even started raining. On my extended layover and delay they offered no hotel or food. I wouldn't say everyone is rude, just the customer service reps in the airport. Telephone and flight attendants where pleasant. I won't fly with them again.",-1

2016-04-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CLE to DFW,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the worst travel experience,False,"  Even as seasoned traveler, this has been the worst travel experience of my life. It started with the hidden fees being an unpleasant surprise. After booking through a travel website I discovered the seating/baggage/etc. fees. I contacted customer service since I was unaware and it actually would have been cheaper to fly another airline once you take into account their fees. Once at the airport, my flight was delayed. Okay, weather and stuff happens. The problem I have is that they were notifying by email only and no one was available at the gate to answer questions. I felt they could have taken better care of people despite having an uncontrollable delay. The fees started they were in place to save time during boarding but they actually did quite the opposite due to the number of individuals that had to be stopped and the time it took for them to complain.  The way home was a new adventure. We were delayed once and the gate agent announced upon the second delay that they could not find our pilots? At that point, I was done. I booked another flight for the following morning on another airline. But it wasn't over yet - they totally lost my bag. Spirit will never get my business again and the site I booked the tickets through should probably stop doing business with them as well. The whole experience was an absolute trainwreck.",-1
2016-04-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to LAS,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,front desk shut the door,False,"  I was at the gate two hours early for my flight from Denver to Las Vegas. The flight was delayed. Finally, we began boarding, and my travel companion didn't have her boarding ticket so we went 20 ft to see if it was in her chair. Meanwhile, the group we were traveling with were waiting for us right after the boarding area to get on the plane. At that time we were at the front desk to print a new boarding pass which was less than 1 minute total. The front desk shut the door, told us he could print a new boarding pass but it wouldn't be until 6pm on the next flight, and there would be a fee. I am a very frequent flyer and have never had the door shut while in line. It turned out that there was only 1 seat available to go to Las Vegas that night. The only other available seat was for the next day at 11am. I would have missed the wedding we were going to. I had bought these tickets January 12th, 2016 and the trip was April 13th, 2016. This was my first experience with Spirit and this is why I will never fly (or attempt to fly) Spirit ever again.",-1

Despite the many negative reviews, I had a great experience with Spirit on both legs of my trip. All of the employees from check in to the flight attendants were pleasant and cheerful. There were no hidden fees as many report. They have a simple, easy to navigate website that explains everything. Many people complain about leg room. I'm 5'11 and had several inches between my kneeson and the seat in front of me. Oh, and both flights left on time and arrived early. I would absolutely not hesitate to use them again!",1

I commend the crew from the cockpit to the cabin, and definitely enjoyed the nonstop option from my big seat!",1

But today we were supposed to fly out at 8 back to New Orleans. We get to check in and we were told the flight was delayed. Then less than 5 minutes we were told our flight was cancelled. So we had to move to another line. Come to find out other passengers were going to Boston, Chicago were also canceled. We get to counter and they tell us lightning hit the plane. Ok, well how does that effect the other 2 planes? Well anyway they only offered refund or flight for next day. We opted for flight next day because with 3 people we couldn't afford another flight. Now I'm here with a 8 year old at a shady hotel. Nothing available due to the fight and GNR concert this weekend. Oh, all other flights were heading out.",-1

They claimed it was due to weather. However It was not windy, not raining, and there were few clouds. All other airlines delayed their flights but did not cancel them. Spirit Air offered only to rebook next day or refund the ticket. With a husband terminally ill in a hospital in San Diego I had no other choice but to go to Soutwest buy a very expensive last minute ticket and fly home. When I got to Southwest Airlines they explained that the reason for the delays was the Vice President had flown over our air space and the area had to be temporarily cleared for security. Once his flight had moved on all carriers were repositioned to fly. This is clearly not a weather issue and Spirit airlines should pay the ticket prices for their customers who had to go to other carriers.",-1

2016-04-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to LBE,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,2.0,seemed not to care at all,False,"  I booked a round-trip flight from Latrobe - a small airport 50 mi. east of Pittsburgh PA to Orlando. The initial departure from LBE to MCO on 3-31 was delayed 2 hours, not a problem. I arrived in Orlando at 9.30 pm on Thursday night. My return flight was a different matter. On 4-2, flight #878, MCO to LBE was originally delayed 45 mins - to 1 hour due to inclement weather. After I arrived at MCO and checked in at the service desk, the Spirit agents asked all passengers for LBE to meet at one end of the counter. We were informed that the flight was cancelled and that the next available flight to LBE would not be for 2 days. Spirit only offered only 2 choices. 1) Receive a refund for only the return flight - $109 or 2) Wait for 2 days. Spirit offered no help with trying to help board another carrier, finding or help reimbursing a hotel, or help with obtaining a rental car. After no luck with Hertz on a one-way rental to LBE, AVIS rented me a one way to PIttsburgh. After 16 hrs and 1026 miles later I arrived in Pittsburgh. I then had to take the Avis rental to PIT then had to get a ride to LBE 50 mile east of PIT to get my truck. Spirit seemed not to care at all that their passengers would be stranded for 2 days and basically left to their own devices. I would never fly this airline again. It's not worth saving a fews bucks to risk being stranded.",-1
2016-04-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SAN to FLL,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,not worth saving the money,False,"  San Diego to Fort Lauderdale. Worst customer service. Cancelled my flight 7 hours prior to departure and this happened late at night so I didn't find out until I went to check in online on my way to airport. They couldnt get me another flight until 3 days later so I had to pay $300 for a new flight home. They told me they gave me a voucher valid for a round trip for inconvenience when I went to use it it was only worth $50. Spent 2 weeks calling them about this and every time it was a different story. All the representatives are like robots. Like they have had the most impersonal customer service training ever. ""Thank you for patiently waiting, please hold another minute or two while we look up your information"". Sometimes it's just not worth saving the money.",-1
2016-04-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to BWI via ORD,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,worst flight experience,False,"  Las Vegas to Baltimore via Chicago. This was the worst flight experience I ever had. Our flight leg from Chicago to Baltimore was cancelled due to ""Air Traffic Control"". I am not sure I believe it or not. The staff at the counter could not have been less helpful. I was told the Chicago to Baltimore flights were booked through April and there was no way to reroute us. They said the airplane that was supposed to go from Boston to Chicago and been cancelled and they were not responsible, but they'll give me a refund for the Chicago - Baltimore leg. The manager was too busy to come and see me, but he eventually did. He reiterated that where was nothing the airline could do for me. Nothing. I ended up having to spend $1,190 for my family and I to fly home on AA. Also we had to drive and go pick up our luggage from the airport instead of them bringing it to my house. Spirit's customer service was the worst I have ever experienced and I will never fly them again. I don't care how inexpensive they are. They said they have no relationship with other airlines so they could not even book us with an alternative. It is not worth taking the risk with Spirit and I am finished with them.",-1

2016-04-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to ATL,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5.0,service received was kind and pleasant,False,"  It's important to remember that Spirit is a low cost carrier and they do everything to turn a profit and keep their costs to a bare minimum. This translates into savings for flights that otherwise might be double at the major airlines. THIS is important to keep in mind. They're not offering luxury but they will get you there inexpensively. The service I received from flight attendants was kind and pleasant. The few flights of Spirit that I've been on have all yielded similar results and it's worth noting that no matter what airline you're on, you're going to get back what you put out.  As a taller person I'd find almost any airline seat (that's not first/biz class or premium economy) uncomfortable and in that sense, Spirit flights aren't drastically different from any other flight you'd take from any other carrier. On the flight coming back from Vegas, I purchased a premium seat and due to a technical snafu whereby they thought I had canceled my trip (they manually boarded me in Atlanta so they had no electronic record of my having flown) I was only allocated a regular seat. However, the manager on duty at McCarran was incredibly understanding and sympathetic and found me an upgraded seat to move into (as they were all technically purchased and I had no choice but to get bumped down, lest the same thing happen to somebody else) without hesitation. I do notice that Spirit flights often experience delays and cancellations, however the company is growing rapidly to meet passenger capacity needs so these problems that arise when flights are delayed getting in from one place, thereby affecting that plane's itinerary for each of its following legs, or when crew time out. All in all, Spirit get you there and get you there cheaply, if not always on time (but usually with little delay). They've got a wonderful, on the whole younger group of crew, their in-flight services leave you wanting for little (I highly recommend their pre-made ""Tequila-Rita"" cocktail) and won't break the bank, and overall still offer anything you could require in an air travel experience.",1

2016-04-01,0.1,Business,Economy Class,ORD to IAH,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,keeps getting worse,False,"  I've flown 42 round trips from Chicago to Houston on Spirit this year. I can't explain it but this miserable airline just keeps getting worse! Last week after 3.5 hours of waiting in the terminal I was offered a chance to reschedule. I ran to the counter and secured the only remaining ticket for the following day. That flight was eventually delayed 4 hours. Today, after checking in on-line I see that again this same flight is delayed for 4 hours. I called hoping to reschedule. The reservation agent was totally incompetent (or she simply didn't have a mastery of basic English). It took her nearly 30 minutes to find my reservation, attempt to change the departure to the next day and then she informed me that there was a $220 charge for changing and that the following day's ticket was more expensive so I'd need to pay that difference. Funny, on-line the 1-way ticket costs $180. But here they hold you hostage. If I was to purchase that new ticket and then not board the original flight they would cancel my return reservation (non-refundable naturally) incurring me the cost of purchasing another return ticket. Unbelievable.",-1

2016-03-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,PDX to MCO,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,2.0,no apology or any assistance,False,"  I flew Spirit Airline on business from Portland to Orlando. My family accompanied me. The flights on these legs were on time and seemed efficient. Things to know about this cheaper airline - No beverages or snacks that you don't pay for, water included. Seats do not recline at all and are extremely uncomfortable. Cabin service is virtually non existent except for trash pick up. All the additional fees - of which there are more than you would ever beleive - add up to more than flying a more reputable airline. Baggage - you will pay for a bag, and dearly. Spirit says about baggage ""why should you have to pay for someone else's baggage in your ticket cost"". Apparently they beleive that no one needs to travel with more than a drivers license and tooth brush and things like clothes and shoes are optional. The return trip was an experience from hell. Our 3/26 flight from Orlando to Dallas was cancelled. The links on the website do no not work so we resorted to the concierge at the hotel attempting to help us. Spirit stated they could get us on a flight 4 days later! Even when we explored driving to different cities to try to get home quicker there was nothing and no offer of help by Spirit. They could have cared less and offered no apology or any assistance for what would have been 4 days of resort fees, rooms, and food. My 76 yr old mom and twin kids were with me and they now are missing school and I am missing work. In the end we opted to rent a car and take an extremely riaky drive 3028 miles across the US because it would get us home faster than Spirit! When I called up Spirit again to see how they would respond to this they seriously could have cared less and only offered a refund of less than 1/2 the cost of our flight. I would not recommend this airline to anyone unless you want to fly with an airline that does not care about their travelers or the inconvenience they impose.",-1
