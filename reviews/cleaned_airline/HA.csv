2024-09-17,1.0,Solo Leisure,First Class,New York JFK to Honolulu,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4,Truly an excellent flight,True,"   A near perfect flight. Very comfortable despite 2-2-2 seating. As a solo traveler I choose a middle aisle seat which is unfettered access and no one climbing over. The privacy divider is small but adequate. A full meal upon takeoff with two options plus a smaller one before landing also with options. Both meals were quite tasty and ample. The flight attendants were excellent combining true aloha with efficiency. The IPad entertainment system is clunky and with limited options but Hawaiian now has free Wi-Fi on most of their long haul aircraft so it’s not a big deal. Reception was excellent the entire flight. A short delay, due to a medical incident was made up for in the air. Truly an excellent flight.",1
2024-08-31,0.9,Family Leisure,First Class,Maui to San Francisco,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,"Wonderful comfortable flight"" ",True,   Wonderful comfortable flight with excellent gracious service provided by two attendants instead of the usual one on Delta American or United. Decent food and drinks. Good seat for 4%1/2 hrs. Free WiFi!,1
2024-06-14,1.0,Solo Leisure,First Class,Kona to Honolulu,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,4,rarely been disappointed,False,"   I've flown on Hawaiian dozens of times, both inter-island and long-haul, and have rarely been disappointed. For a KOA-HNL round trip everything was just fine as usual: Punctual, friendly service, inflight refreshments fine considering it's a 40 minute flight, and no hassles. I wish they weren't quite so pricey, but Hawaiian has been habitually very reliable.",1
2024-06-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Los Angeles via Honolulu,,,,,,1.0,1,Horrible Experience,True,"  Horrible Experience. They left me stranded in anther country. Had a round trip ticket for Auckland NZ. My flight home was scheduled on April 25th. I had confirmation #, flight details etc and my flight home disappeared! It simply did not exist when I arrived to the airport! They stopped flying to New Zealand while I was there! I did not receive any notification. I spent over $850 to get home on time for my father's funeral. They only offered me about half that amount. I have been waiting patiently for over 5 weeks for them to make this right before I decided to give them a bad review.",-1
2024-05-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,,,,,,,1,"They lost a client"" ",False,"   Be careful with their bait and switch credit card offers. Was given an in-flight promo code to receive 70,000 points after spending only one $1 within first 90 days. Applied for the card on their website, never saw a place to add the promo. Card was approved with a requirement to spend $2000 during the first 90 days. Immediately called the Barclays Bank provider and they said they could not take the promo after the card was approved. Poor customer service. So, I closed the card. After investigating around, here's what I found: If you apply from Hawaiian Airlines website https://www.hawaiianairlines.com you will NOT see a promo box. You have to go to https://www.myhawaiiancard.com to see a promo box before applying. It is the exact same application, but one does not provide a promo box. See the attached pictures. Deceitful credit card application design & careless customer service. They lost a client for life! And, their family, and their friends, and their influence group.",-1
2024-05-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hawaii to Sydney,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,seats were uncomfortable,False,"   Terrible airline, clearly cares about shareholders more than customers. The plane was outdated with old 10 year old entertainment systems that was slow clunky and lacked features. The seats were uncomfortable small and worn beyond acceptable levels for an airline that should be proud of it's service and reputation. Food was terrible, a sandwich for dinner? They cannot compete with even the most basic foreign airline. The staff were excellent and smiling and definitely the backbone of this airline professional and courteous, but I feel sorry for them serving up such poor products on a run down derelict old plane they should be proud employees. I'd avoid Hawaiian airlines and Alaska airlines, two of the worst quality flights I've ever experienced.",-1
2024-05-11,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Boston,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,“the worst service airline”,True,  Absolutely the worst service airline you can fly. Makes Spirit look like Emirates. No help when trying to change a flight other than “book it again and take it up with your insurance company” is what you’re told by the customer service manager. I will never fly this airline again simply due to the fact that you will get nowhere with the customer service team. Bought insurance to protect your flight and need to change a passengers name? Nope. You’ll have to eat the cost and book a totally new ticket and they will send the seat empty (Literally what the service manager told me was going to happen).,-1
2024-05-07,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Sydney Australia,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2,“such an unprofessional flight crew”,False,"  I have never flown with such an unprofessional flight crew. Also lack of food for the 10 hour flight We had a very small meal the first hour at about 2 pm. I saw water being offered about three times in the afternoon which was good. No afternoon tea or snack, meaning tea or coffee or cold drinks and nothing to eat at all. When I asked about dinner, the male host seemed quite irritated that I expected dinner. He said it was going to be a snack. It was a sandwich that came around about an hour and a half before landing which was about 6:30 pm. The staff had no class, more likely they should’ve been back in Hawaii in the Hawaiian shirts serving in a beachside bar normally hosts annd hostesses are very professional but these were quite the opposite. I actually told the hostess this was the worst airline I had ever travelled on. My partner flew from Hawaii to Sydney on another airline and in a 10 1/2 hour flight so they had two proper meals and then a snack during the day, I feel this is a very honest review with no exaggeration.",-1
2024-04-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oalkland to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1,We have no other options,False,"   I am very disappointed with all of the players in line to serve Hawaiian Islands and most importantly Hawaiian Airlines. I've lived in Hawaii since 2018 and the price and quality of the interisland travel not only has jump dramatically in the last several years (its not a longer distance, there are no improvements, the gas prices are stable,  but the service is bad, everything is in addition to an already 500% increased price. We have no other options but to fly from Oahu to Maui, Hawaii and Kauai, the only ferries left are between Maui and Lanai and Molokai. I used to be able to go see my family at least 2-4 times a year. Now I cannot afford it at all. Why are the Hawaiian airlines so greedy? Yes go ahead and charge international/intracontinental passengers whatever you want, but don't cut our wings when trying to keep our families and community connected. This is a huge problem! Hawaiian Airlines have not improved on the quality of customer service, or the comfort of their passengers, neither the availability of food or drinks, and finally flight times (flights availability), yet their prices jumped from $48-$55/ round trip with Mokulele who was an extremely reliable, fast and comfortable commuter between islands, to $250-300 for a 20 min fight? it is absolutely appalling and is extremely damaging for the interisland business and communities.  What is their problem acting like a discount airline, yet asking for TOP dollar. I believe Is because they can, no competition. It is ridiculous and we are stuck at their mercy. It is terrible for all of us locals..",-1
2024-03-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,New York to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“Complete bait and switch”,True, Complete bait and switch. No pods. Open seats. No entertainment screen at seat. Worn out seat belt. Horrible. Demand 11 hour flight basically coach seat for first class no WiFi on board not even a tv screen. Complete ripoff my first and last time on this airline.,-1
2024-02-21,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,San Diego to Honolulu,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,“No help from anyone”,False," Horrific service. There was no sky cap, only one employee at the counter. We searched for first class check in, nothing. In horrible rain after leaving almost 4 hours early due to unforseen accidents and such they had nerve to say the cut off time for bags was 8:05 and as of now it just turned 8:07. I said what you have no employees where any other airline does are you serious. They wouldn't budge. We threw away a bag and my other friend was like no I can't throw all my stuff away. Horrible legacy to leave, rude employees I personally will never fly Hawaiian again in my life. No help from anyone just a trashy experience",-1
2024-02-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oahu to Sacramento,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,"Didn't try to hold flight"" ",False,   The airline kiosk broke down. They only had 2 employees one of which decided to have breaks while the line was out the door. We were already checked in but just needed to tag bags and go. There were other people behind us in same situation. The line took an hour just to drop off bags. We got to desk with 55 minutes for departure and they told us no. Told us we had to fly standby the following day. Can't help us with getting a room. No rental.car. No comps. And she didnt show an ounce of concern or willingness to help. Staff refused to give us her name to contact company with a report. She said she would write up her own report and we didnt need her name. We finally got her name from a manager. There was only 1 manager on duty to help. We had to wait long time for manager. Didn't try to hold flight for several paying customers in same situation. We had 2 young children.  We had gotten the Hawaiian credit card for perks but now and canceling it.,-1
2024-02-08,1.0,Solo Leisure,First Class,Kona to Honolulu,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,Not a single complaint,True,"  Short but pleasant ride inter island. Completely full plane boarded fairly efficiently. Great attendant in the front drink refills, done graciously. Not a single complaint.",1
2023-11-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,delayed for almost 2 hours for no reason,True,"  We took a flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu on November 29 at 7 am. My other group of friends used Delta airlines and departed at8am. Flight duration was the same l, however they landed way before us. Hawaiian Airlines used the weather as an excuse to land in Maui. How is that possible if my friends were right behind us and landed before us , something is not adding up. We were stuck in Maui for about an hour ""refueling"" might spend extra next time and use Delta. We were delayed for almost 2 hours for no reason.",-1
2023-11-15,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Honolulu,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5,service was very smooth and efficient,True,"  Checking in at Tokyo's Haneda was very smooth despite my flying standby. Hawaiian does not have check in kiosks like they do back home but the JAL Staff manning the check-in counters were very quick and efficient. Going through Immigration and Security screening was quick, easy, and efficient. Having gone through NRT and HND, I definitely prefer HND. The flight aboard Hawaiian Airlines A332 was very smooth with some turbulence along the way. The cabin staff kept us informed and turned on the seat belt signs with the turbulence. Surprised that no announcements made from the cockpit throughout the flight. Cabin service was very smooth and efficient with the usual Aloha Spirit shown by each of the cabin attendants. Food was good, the entertainment system worked well with the exception of the inflight map which did not work at all. This was HA 864 11/9/2023. Very disappointed that the inflight map was not working on this particular aircraft. HA's A332's are excellent aircraft, but are starting to show their age. The lack of wi-fi is a definite minus. Hopefully things will improve with the arrival of their Boeing 787-9, although April 2024 is not soon enough. HA should work on getting wi-fi on board their A332's and A321's. All in all a great flight. Hoping Hawaiian Airlines Dreamliners will utilize 2-4-2 layout in economy, as with their partner Japan Airlines. JAL's Dreamliners have the roomiest and most comfortable economy I've ridden.",1
2023-11-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Lihua via Corona,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,Made us feel so unimportant,False,"  So sad. I have never been downgraded in seat assignments. We came early to check in to get a middle row seat. Just before boarding they moved us to the way back, by the bathroom. Talked to the counter person, zero care. Said they moved everyone back to balance the plane. Made us feel so unimportant. Won't use this airline again.",-1
2023-10-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Honolulu,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,2,"think twice before flying with them again"" ",True,"   I am writing this review after an absolutely harrowing and frustrating experience on a recent flight with Hawaiian Airlines from Las Vegas to Honolulu. I am still in shock and disbelief over the terrifying incident that occurred during our trip.  The flight started off poorly, with multiple delays that were poorly communicated. The departure time was continually pushed back. This caused a lot of unnecessary stress and confusion, and no explanation or apology was given for the inconvenience. Then, at the start if the flight, our plane was struck by lightning. The flight crew, although they tried to maintain calm, seemed just as shocked as we were. Upon landing, the communication from the airline was still lacking. There was no debriefing, no reassurances, and no explanation of what had occurred. It was as if they wanted to brush the whole incident under the rug. This lack of responsibility is unacceptable. However, I do want to express my gratitude to the pilot who managed to land the plane safely under such stressful conditions. His skill and professionalism in that moment were the only silver linings in this otherwise dismal experience. Despite this, I am extremely disappointed with Hawaiian Airlines. Our safety, both physical and emotional, should have been their utmost priority, but it felt like we were an afterthought. The inconvenience of the delay and the lack of apology for the lost day of our vacation only added to our dissatisfaction. I will think twice before flying with them again.",-1
2023-10-11,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Honolulu,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,3,attendants were so grumpy,False,  Would not recommend Hawaiian Airlines. Flight attendants were so grumpy. Their service was very unprofessional compared to some airlines I have flown with. One flight attendant didn’t give out the right amount of headsets/eye masks so we had to ask for an extra one. She did that with 4 other people who missed out on them too. The woman who served the food didn’t even know what was in the sandwich. Felt so uncomfortable around her and if I had to ask any questions I felt I couldn’t. Didn’t even say goodbye thank you for flying etc when we were getting off.,-1
2023-09-16,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Los Angeles,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5,exhibited genuine Aloha spirit,True,"  I just wanted to say that Flight Attendant Miley, based in Los Angeles, exhibited genuine Aloha spirit in our interactions. It is evident she thoroughly enjoys working her job, her coworkers and her customers, thank you Miley! You are amazing. Flight 34, Maui to Los Angeles.",1
2023-09-11,0.3,Solo Leisure,First Class,Honolulu to Seattle,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,3,feels like the economy of economy,True," Being local, I am not proud to say that Hawaiian Airlines did not meet my requirements for being a good representative of Hawaii. I am sure no one is going to read this from Hawaiian Airlines but if they do. 1) The website is not good. I couldn't do online check-in, the website is slow and very ""heavy"". It's not intuitive and a lot of the links do not work. I am not sure if this is on purpose but just got to do better with the website. 2) In-flight service was not great. Food was subpar and the entertainment was again ""heavy"". However, most of all....the seats are horrible in Economy class. Not comfortable at all. It REALLY feels like the economy of economy. I thought Hawaiian would offer a little better than that. 3) Finally. I felt like I was being nickled and dimed for everything. I received multiple offers to upgrade, or had to pay extra for every little thing. It felt like an LCC. Not sure if Hawaiian is going through some financial problems, but as a customer it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when I keep getting asked if I want to BID to get a better seat. The Aloha is lacking. As a whole it was not really bad but compared to United, Delta, and Alaska, I was really disappointed with Hawaiian. I don't want to trash talk them. I was just very disappointed that my local airline was so junk compared to others. Especially since everything in Hawaii is so expensive. Unfortunately, as a customer, I will be avoiding Hawaiian when I can in favor of other carriers.",-1
2023-09-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Kona to Honolulu,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,Poor customer support,True,"  Poor customer support and indifferent counter agents. No ability to make changes to your flight online so you have to call in order to make changes to a reservation. Phone lines can be down so it can take several dialing attempts before you get through. In one particular instance, we needed to change our departure time (interisland) to a flight thirty minutes later and were told there would be a change fee equal to the cost of the ticket. When we asked for clarification on the unreasonably high charge, the customer service agent, who clearly was not based in Hawaii or the US, hung up on us. As someone who lives in Hawaii, we try to fly Southwest, which in comparison, charges no fees for ticket changes, allows you to make changes on their website, allows up to two pieces of luggage checked in for free, and has great customer service. Additionally, they jack up the rates of interisland flights when there are no competing flights. Not very aloha.",-1
2023-08-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Kahului,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,App crashes on a routine basis,True,"  After first booking direct from SFO to OGG and back my flights were changed in a vague email that made no sense or didn’t seem to apply to me. No details were embedded in email and their App crashes on a routine basis. So instead of direct to Maui I need to go through Honolulu. Once arrived boarded for Maui but had engine troubles as we were then stuck in heat. For passengers going to Oahu to Seattle on this flight other arrangements were made and most of the plane disembarked. Another 10 minutes and remaining passengers were told to go to B2. No departure or arrival time provided. Went to B2 and gate attendant said we were now leaving out of gate A14 (next door to original departure gate). Even though there was a flight to Maui at 2:35pm we weren’t able to board that flight, and had to walk back to gate with no idea of said departure. Been traveling now for 10 hours and feel numb and pissed at idiot’s who are operating Hawaiian Airlines. If you have a mechanical issue they must have a procedure or practice to help the frustrations of passengers who are now getting on/off planes twice. What a bunch of idiots running this show.",-1
2023-08-24,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Las Vegas,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,1,Never flying with them again,True,"  The return flight from Maui to Las Vegas was cancelled and I was rebooked on a different airline from Honolulu to Las Vegas. The problem, I have to pay for seats and check in baggage and Hawaiian Airlines could not do anything for me. I talk to a representative and they said they could not do anything for me at their end. The agent would or. Could not forward me to someone who could do something for me. I thought they would do something for the customer in good faith because they are the ones who change my reservations to United. Very disappointed in Hawaiian Airlines. Never flying with them again.",-1
2023-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Maui,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again,False,"  We had booked 4 round trip tickets from Saturday to Saturday to Maui. Saturday morning when I check online to see if our flight was on time, I read that the flight had been cancelled. I called customer support to book another flight. The same flight, the next day was the next one available. Then the agent told me I had to pay for the flight on Sunday. I explained that I was booking the flight because the Saturday flight was cancelled. He would not listen, so I bought 4 more tickets. The following Saturday, I checked our returning flight and found that we were on standby, not reserved seats. This was after I had previously confirmed both flight. I could reserve the seats for $200 each. In other words, they extorted us for an additional $800. To add more insanity, the walk from the gate at LAX to the sidewalk is one mile. When I got home, I called my credit card company and had the charges I had made Saturday for the new flight cancelled. There was no dispute from Hawaiian Air, since what they had done is illegal. We visit Maui twice a year. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again!",-1
2023-08-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Honolulu to San Diego,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,lady behind the counter rudely started chirping,True," Reason for leaving Hawaiian Airlines as a preferred carrier. In February of 2023, my wife and I decided to purchase tickets from Hawaii Airlines(HA) after learning our cat would only be allowed in the cabin on either Alaskan Airlines or Hawaiian Airlines. We had also made changes the year before placing this as one of our preferred airlines on our AMEX because we had used them a few times to go stateside. My wife felt unsettled in May with the ticket because it did not mention the cat on the ticket. So, she called the airlines to ensure our cat can fly in the cabin. She received confirmation and the cost for our cat Fred to fly. Post the conversation, she felt better about choosing HA as the preferred airline. On one occasion, we checked the HA webpage and noted they were changing their pet carrier dimensions. The pet carrier we owned prior was one inch larger, and since HA was making the changes effective June 2023, and we were flying until 20 July, we did not want to take any chances of having a tape measure come out and stop the cat from flying with us. So, we bought a new carrier to fit their new guidelines and started months in advance to get him acclimated to the new pet carrier. If you own pets, you understand this reason. Moves can be stressful enough on people, but when the animal does not have a place of refuge, it can be even more stressful. On the morning of 20 July, we went to the airport with eight bags and the cat. My wife was due to fly on HA 19 to San Diego, and I helped her move three bags containing all our clothes, along with our cat, into the Hawaiian Airlines departure terminal. My buddy then drove the kids and me to the Southwest terminal since NAVPTO could not get us on the same flight. I started unloading the truck, and I got a call from my wife crying, “They will not let Fred (cat) fly! They said he is too big and could not stand.” The cat was calm as a cucumber in his new kennel after a month of finally getting acclimated to it. We had one an inch bigger than the latest change HA made and my wife was just trying to get clarity. My buddy, who was dropping us off, brought his cat to Oahu two weeks prior from Sacramento on HA with a pet carrier which was the same as the one we chose to not use because of its size. So, we asked if he could get his carrier to fly with our cat. We also asked a friend to bring us their hard case pet carrier. Before their arrival, my wife went into the line and showed the bag turning on its side, unzips, and expands, allowing the cat to stand and just wanted to know if it would work. The lady said, ""You cannot alter the carrier!"" my wife calmly explained, ""It is not altering it; it is just unzipping the side."" Again, the rude lady stated you cannot alter the bag and no this will not work. Shortly after this, our friend brought the hard case pet carrier to fly the cat in the belly of the aircraft. Then the HA associate stopped my wife because she had a reservation for the cat to fly in the cabin. My wife was trying to explain she's moving to California to another HA associate, and the lady behind the counter rudely started chirping, “She started crying, thinking I would change my mind!” Who says that in the service department of Hawaiian Airlines? Apparently, it was ok for this lady to do so, and she was allowed to escalate the situation, which my wife was just trying to find out how she could fly with the cat in the cabin or get the cat off the island. FRUSTRATED!",-1
2023-08-15,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Los Angeles,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,1,tells me I was bumped to standby,False,"  19 hours before flight couldn't check in online. Couldn't check in at kiosk. Counter rep tells me flight ""might"" be booked up. Gives me a boarding pass for a later departure (without informing me). I proceed to the initial gate Info from telescopes. Get to gate and my boarding pass doesn't work. They tell me I'm on plane for 6 hours later.  I argue, they are calling my name, as I'm arguing and they are emailing me. I show my id, they tell me I'm on standby for a flight in 6 hours.  They played me, gave my seat away right in front of me, said I checked in for the wrong flight, I explain the situation, and she tells me I was bumped to standby.",-1
2023-08-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Kaui,,,,,,,1,never use the airline again,False,"  I have used them 2 times previous to this and had no problems, but I was scheduled to fly with them this October going to Maui then to Kaui but due to the horrific sad and devastating situation in Maui we are not able to go there and decided to make our vacation to Kaui only. I had opened a credit card with them and one of the perks was to get a 1/2 off companion pass in which we used on our first reservation, when I went to rebook my flight not only did the price of my tickets more than double in price but they penalized us by taking away our companion pass saying we already used it on one reservation and now because we had to rebook we would lose it. I spoke to a supervisor who gave me the worst customer service I have ever had with a airlines and said there was nothing they could do about companion pass it was just gone. Hawaiian airlines could care less about there customers and will mess you over in a second. I do not recommend them and will never use the airline again as well canceling their credit card.",-1
2023-08-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hilo to Honolulu,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,today was terrible,False," I have been a loyal Hawaiian Airlines customer for over 30 years but today was terrible. I booked an interisland trip for my family 3 months in advance. I booked seats so my family could all sit together. Getting to Hilo was fine, everything went smooth no issues, which is why I always choose Hawaiian. However my flight home from Hilo was a joke. First off I went to the ticket counter to try and change my flight to am earlier one and the ticket agent wouldn't look up flights for me. He insisted that the only way I could change is by calling their call centre in the Philippines. I know this isn't true because they've done same day changes for me before with no issues. I decide to let it go and just keep our original flight. We come back a few hours later and the same guy changed my selected seats and had all of us, including my 3 year old daughter, sitting by separately. He took off his name tag so I didn't get his name. He wanted me to wait in line to be helped again. I couldn't wait another 20 mins so I went to the gate to fix this error. The guy at the gate desk Darryl was giving me attitude saying well it's only a short flight and infants cant sit in the 4th row because ""there's an airbag."" I've never heard this before and I don't care if the flight was 5 minutes long, my 3 year old daughter is not sitting be herself. So he begrudgingly sat me and my daughter together in the very last row and my wife and my other infant child sat somewhere else. If you want decent customer service look for another airline. I'd be willing to fly Southwest after this fiasco.",-1
2023-08-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Phoenix,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,never fly with this airline again,True,"  In my 50 years of flying this was my first trip with Hawaiian Airlines and it has been the worst experience ever. Started off with flight being cancelled to Kona, and needed to hang around airports until I got squeezed in somewhere. During this my seats I paid extra for were no longer assigned. On the way back my flight from Kona was cancelled and then the flight to Phoenix was cancelled. Again the seats I paid extra for were not assigned and then the luggage I had to pay for on-line when buying tickets had to be paid again, because, as explained to me, “the baggage fee is for a different flight”. They owe me money at this point, and I will never fly with this airline again.",-1
2023-08-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Honolulu to Hilo,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,"Customer service is almost non-existent"" ",True," Hawaiian Airlines cares little for its passengers because the airline holds a virtual monopoly over interisland travel in Hawaii. Customer service is almost non-existent. Hawaiian recently ""upgraded"" its check-in process, and merely created a confusing, time-consuming, and frustrating opportunity for its personnel to show disregard for passengers. The contempt does not end there. Almost without exception (in fairness, there are a few good apples), every Hawaiian Airlines employee from check-in to departure treats passengers as inconveniences rather than as revenue-paying guests of the airline. It would not take much for Hawaiian to improve its outward face substantially.",-1
2023-08-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hilo to Honolulu,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,3,Avoid unless you have a world of time to spare,True," They canceled my flight last minute, which needs me to grab the last seat in the next flight. Still, they don't manage their boarding gate well and the flight needs to wait for an available boarding on the ground. Avoid this airline unless you have a world of time to spare. In comparison, flight experience and staff service are fair. But still, the airline makes side trips to another island in Hawaii very hard. Despite Hawaii being a holiday destination, the Hawaiian airline makes travelling in Hawaii a painful and stressful experience. Last thing to note: the Hawaiian airlines say that you can change your flight within Hawaii freely, that is not very true. Firstly, you cannot do it online, you can only by phone or in person at an airport. Second, if you have checked in luggage, you cannot change to an earlier flight. I am totally OK with additional fee for changing flight, but having unwritten rule for that is not OK for me.",-1

I was unable to apply it a few days later and called and they told me to wait 3-5 business days and try again. I tried again today, July 19 and was again not able to apply it. I then called again and they say they are still unable to apply it on their end. I asked to speak with someone above them and they said they could not even put me in line to talk to a manager due to high call volume. I am now suspicious they are just trying to get me to give up and have no intention of making good on their voucher. This review does not apply to any of the rating areas below and I've defaulted to using ground service, though my review is specifically regarding customer service, for which I give them a 1/5.

Not only have the flights been delayed by many hours but with no informative updates! Both time seemed to be pilot and ground crew have not cleared flight yet. The first time we missed connection and staff were extremely unhelpful in helping us get another flight. In the end put us on a lesser value one with no compensation! This time we get a voucher for $12 which doesn’t even cover the cost of a sandwich. We are also obliged to stay the night in Honolulu because connecting flights aren’t until the next day, but by the time we get there it is a total waste of money.

Flying back from Hilo (changed flight from Kona) to Sydney. Arrived at the airport over 2 hours early. Checked luggage… then had to wait for security. No mention when I checked that one of the machines was down and the wait was over 3.5 hours to get through the scanner… Meant missed flight, then missed connecting flight. To my surprise the “machine hadn’t just gone down”… it had been down for a few days. They could have prioritised it being fixed, text passengers to let them know arrive 4 hours ahead to allow time to get through security (due to only one bag scanner). They then also lost my luggage - which I later managed to track down a few days later thanks to the apple AirTag, not the Hawaiian staff who had no idea where it was. Only flew with Hawaiian to get points as a partner airline to Virgin Australia. Needed to do a claim for insurance on extra costs incurred from this issue (connecting flights and hotels not connected with this booking) extra costs included $500 - wrote in feedback and complaints several times to all channels and ZERO response. Points also never came through even though they had my number, submitted claim through virgin with details and to Hawaiian. Seriously most incompetent service at all levels.

We were just standing and waiting for boarding on side and not in anyone’s way. She told us to go site down, i reply saying we are not in anyone’s way. She then said they will be calling the pre boarding and first class first. When I told her I am first class, she didn’t believe me and took the boarding pass out of d my hand to confirm.

All the staff are genuinely customer focused, friendly, cheerful and enthusiastic about helping travelers. All staff members from Check in, Baggage Handling, Departure Lounges and Flight Attendants were always smiling, welcoming and pleasant to deal with. Such a refreshing change from most major airlines who can learn a lot from Hawaiian. They even give you a free welcome drink of juice or water! True Hawaiian hospitality - genuine and sincere.

2023-05-27,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kahului,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,really carry the spirit of Aloha,True," Hawaiian Airlines is really the airline to fly with between the Hawaiian islands. There was a hiccup on my experience but it was handled very well. Terminal 1 in Honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time I had visited 10 years ago, and feels very modern, airy and welcoming, but less ""island-style"" - simple and relaxing, which is what the other airports around Hawaii feel like. Security took less than five minutes, and there was plenty of seating at our gate. I had two trips with Hawaiian, from Honolulu to Lihue/Kauai and Honolulu to Kahului/Maui. Both these flights are what I would describe as ""up and down"" flights, literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent. One of the funniest things that I realised was that on both trips, the flights out of Honolulu was operated by the same aircraft (N483HA) and left from the same gate A19. When I asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircraft's registration, I told her ""I flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to Kauai two months ago!"" She was extremely nice and joked that I should buy it, since it was ""my plane."" That really made my day. Onboard, even though these aircraft are around 20 years old, they did not feel too old, and the 2-3 seating configuration is great for couples and families. I definitely recommend choosing an A window seat when departing from Honolulu to get a great view of Waikiki beach. The seats themselves actually don't recline and have a small drinks tray - no way you could get any work on your laptop done. Considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes, I don't see any issue with the bus-like seats. The surprising thing is that during these ""up and down"" flights, the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water, juice or coffee, the latter only on morning flights. Even with the limited service due to the short flight time, I still had great interactions with the flight attendants. The return from Kahului/Maui was a bit of an issue, where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in Honolulu. I went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight, and I was rebooked at no extra charge. Hawaiian Airlines' operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays, the knock on effects went on for hours. However given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight (and luckily I didn't end up in a middle seat) it shows that they can handle a crisis very well. Indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed, but it meant I got into Honolulu an hour earlier than if I was still on my original flight. Overall, Hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product, and beats other US regional carriers by miles. They really carry the spirit of Aloha onboard and I would definitely choose them over Southwest when flying Inter-Island, except if I needed to check any luggage.",1
2023-05-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lihue to Kahului via Honolulu,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,structured incompetence,True," Where to begin? First leg of flight initially delayed. That is not my complaint. Came in after supposed departure of connecting flight. Was told by gate agent to stand in line that would take at least an hour, while the connecting flight was still boarding but not told that! Found out by going to the gate instead of waiting in line. They let me on. All my bags did not make it however. Filed a claim at airport on Maui. Was provided a number that doesn't work. Still trying to reach a human and when I do they pass me off to another number that starts with thank you for your patience, but we are helping others and then plays music that is from WW2 cabaret with no response while asking me if I would like to participate in a survey after they don't help me. So here I am with 3 lost bags, no one to help track it down and no one at that airline is hired to care. It is structured incompetence, insensitive employees on an airline that has a monopoly on this island for most inter-island travel. Not sure what to do next as no human ever responds on their phone line, which is recorded for training persons. My best guess is they immediately fire anyone who actually helps! Poor people of Hawaii, so little choice in flying one or 2 islands over.",-1

Flight from Maui to LAX was scheduled at 12:40pm. When we arrived at the gate, we were told it was delayed. Then, we were moved to another gate. No one ever provided updates. We sat for hours to later find out the flight was canceled. No one from the airline came out to direct the passengers to next steps. Line for ticketing did not move. Luggage did not come out until 5 hours after the flight had been scheduled to take off. I had to book my own flight out for the next day and book a hotel, totalling $1,000+ for 3 people. This is an additional significant expense and hardship for my family. Who knows if and when I will ever be reimbursed. This airline needs to get it together and have a process for communicating to passengers what the process is in these situations. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed.

Not Hawaiian Airlines, it's taken 5 to 10 minutes per standby passenger.

Traveled with my wife 2 months ago and Hawaiian Airlines decided to move my flight up 2 hours earlier without notifying us. 20 people missed that flight due to the lack of communication from Hawaiian. We had to pay 600.00 to buy tickets on another carrier to get back home. I was also bumped on a flight last year in Seattle with Hawaiian, we have yet to get reimbursed for that transaction from Hawaiian Airlines.

2023-05-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Seattle via Maui,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,felt so helpless and disregarded,False,"  The flight was a connecting flight to Seattle, WA from Honolulu HNL connecting in Maui OGG. The Maui to Seattle flight was delayed by over 4 hours and we were not informed or notified in any manner. We had arrived from Honolulu and were waiting by the gate when we noticed the departure time change. I was traveling with my wife and 9 month old son and we did not expect this and didn't know what to do since this was our first time travelling with him. My wife went to inquire about the situation and was told by the manager/chief at the gate desk and they said ""there is nothing we can do"". She was worried because we did not have any baby food left or formula and it was frustrating. I went to speak to the same manager/chief and ask if we could get any assistance because we would have to sit in an airport with an infant for an additional 4 hours on top of the initial 2 hour of our flight. While I was talking to them they called security and threatened to get us thrown out of the airport because manager said she will not speak to us because ""we could not understand even is she tried to explain it"" I believe she was trying to imply we were incapable of understanding her and we need to move out of the way so she can help other customers. Shas just gotten another frustrated customer who was yelling and screaming at her and being hysterical but she gave her a completely different treatment and gave her another flight since she was from there and decided to flight out another time. We stood back and record while the security arrived and started questioning us. This was so frightening for us. We didnt know what was going to happen to us. Were we going to get arrested? were they going to take out infant son from us? what were we going to do in a place that is foreign to us and we did not know anyone there so thats where we were recording for our own safety. We decided to wait it out because it felt like the more inquiries or help we requested it was met with aggression and complete disregard of our infant child. We swore never to travel there ever again because we have never felt so helpless and disregarded and treated so poorly compared to others.",-1

2023-05-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Hawaii,,,,,,1.0,1,stressful and unnecessary situation,False,"  This was such a stressful and unnecessary situation. My husband is Navy and we were stationed in Hawaii in February of this year. Hawaii has very strict pet laws, so while I got all that sorted, our cat lived with a friend on the mainland. I finally booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines for May 5th for my friend to fly our cat out to be with us, and just to double check that I had all my ducks in a row, I called their customer service line. I went over everything with the representative on the phone, including asking her specifically if our cat was good to fly on this flight and she said yes. I even offered to pay for the ticket ahead of time, which is insane that they don't let you do that, it is first come first serve since they only allow 4 pets on the plane at a time. We get off the phone and I am content that I did everything I was supposed to. My friend drives an hour and a half to Atlanta airport, gets there at 3:30am for her 6am flight, and the front desk denies a ticket to our cat. All they can tell us is that there is an error in their system and they cannot book her a ticket. They were incredibly incompetent. I was on the phone with her the whole time listening. They were rude to my friend and told her to just go the gate without a ticket for our cat! They held her up so much that she had to run from the train to her gate, and then come to find out they had the wrong gate printed on her ticket so she missed the flight anyway! We got on the phone with customer service and mind you, it's 11pm where we are. We then spend the next hour explaining what just happened and asking Hawaiian to fix it, and eventually they get us to a very nice manager named Joyce who helped us schedule another flight for the same day at 10:35am. Time comes for our friend to buy the ticket for our cat for the new flight, and the same problem happens. It took another hour for us to get a straight answer from front desk; Hawaiian Airlines had booked both flights with JetBlue as the first leg of the flight, and Hawaiian Airlines does NOT allow connecting flights with other airlines to carry pets. You'd think a manager on the customer service line might know that before booking our tickets and wasting more of our time. So if she had made it to the gate in time, they still would have turned our cat away. At that point we told our friend to just go home. My husband stayed up until 8am on the phone with their customer service trying to get them to fix us another flight for the next day, but they told us the only way they could do it is if we purchased two separate round trips and arranged for the times to line up. There are no nonstop flights to Hawaii that allow pets that fly out of Atlanta, so she would have had to stop in Seattle. There are so many risks involved in buying tickets that way, not to mention possible delays, going back through TSA when she lands in Seattle and the fact we did not want our cat in a carrier for that long. In the end we just asked for a refund. They gave us an additional $70 (whoopie) for wasted time, and apologized for the ""miscommunication"". We are booking another flight with Alaska Airlines instead. I was devastated, sobbing in the middle of the night because I have been so stressed out planning this for months , and they ruined it in the last hour. Never ever using them again. Only giving two stars because Joyce was so kind and apologetic to us.",-1

We wait in the plane for 2 hrs, with the excuse being that they are waiting on a part that needs to be shipped to Maui. Finally they deplane us, and lie to us saying that they need to install said part now - so first it was that the part needed to be shipped, and now it needs to be installed?

I reached out to your customer service team for assistance, hoping to help me with this issue. However, I was extremely disappointed with the response that I received. Despite my explaining the urgency of my situation, your representative informed me that Hawaiian Airlines was not able to help me with my reservation as it was made less than 24 hours ago. This is a policy that was not clearly communicated when I made the reservation. I find this policy to be unfair and unreasonable.

I purposely booked air and hotel travel package through the Hawaiian airlines website, but it turns out it actually went through Expedia without my knowledge. Several issues: website had the option selected to pick seats (that was a lie). Received a pop-up message I could pick seats after booking, (another lie). I never received a confirmation email, and had to call in to get a confirmation the day before the flight. When I called in to get the confirmation I was told that I did not book through the airline website. They said I booked through Expedia. I was never able to pick my seats and flying with kids makes it very stressful not knowing where everyone is sitting. The gate agent apparently picks your seats for you. They will however offer to sell you upgraded seats which is pretty greasy. Staff are extremely rude and not very helpful. Seats were uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment system was broken and no WiFi. Very expensive checked bag fees, you pay for all checked bags.

They had no clue of how to assist us with other routes we could take. When we had a lay over in San Jose we found out the flight was canceled. We called customer service to find out what would happen with our bags as we would be in Maui already.

Zone 3 over there in an unnecessary loud yelling pitch once more. There is no reason to yell at any passenger. She has the wrong temperament for her job. I was Embarrassed and boarded my flight very upset in Hawaii of all places. Then, There were issues with plane and we were boarded and de-boarded 2x so we had to stand in line. Just my luck we get her again. Patiently waiting, finally our turn, We wait to be summoned to approach her desk after watching her handle all people before us just fine. She looks up and say do y’all have a question or what? After standing in line all that time, yes we have questions and and need a connection flight issues. She told us she doesn’t know anything we don’t have any option and just to sit tight, sorry. For Another 6 hours. This has been the rudest experience I’ve encountered and added unnecessary stress to a stressful travel day on their part. Now if I would have conducted my self with the same volume and shortness reminding her that I’m not a child. Don’t yell at me I’m standing right here, they would not allow me to board their plane. So I have to take the mistreatment and deal with it after spending my money with this airlines. And I'm sitting here looking at her in her computer helping every guest after me. She didn’t even look at anything in the computer to me! I love coming to Maui. We come every year and this is my first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines (Honolulu was my transfer flight) Never Again. Thanks for making a stressful travel day with Hawaiian airlines more uncomfortable and have me sitting here angry instead of relaxing to get through this next 6 hours in the airport. They announced they were helping with connecting flights over the speaker yet at her desk she advises calling the airline my ticket is with. So why did I stand in line 45 mins at 1 am.",-1

I went back to Hawaiian Air and was once again told it's not their responsibility and I have to contact the airport. I now resisted this and shared what the airport had told me but the customer service rep was adamant that they don't help with lost luggage. I went back and forth to both parties one more time before filing a police report and filing a complaint with the FAA. If you take the time to read thru the FAA guidelines it is clearly the airlines responsibility to assist with lost luggage, but Hawaiian Air does nothing to help their customers with this. I was going to sign up for their credit card and intend to use them more often, but I will now do what I can to stay away from them.",-1
2023-03-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hilo to Honolulu,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1,they treat me like the low class,True,"  I took advantage of the low fare that Hawaiian Airlines offered and then they treat me like the low class that the ticket represents. I had to check my own bags but I couldn't select my own seat. No one is available to help you check your bags because all the agents are standing at the boarding gate and sorting out the seating arrangement for the low budget flyers ... and that's how they assign their staff time. You then board in group 6 and scrap for baggage space in the overhead bins. You get what you pay for and you are treated like it too. Only positive of the trip was the movie selection, after you pay $4 for earbuds.",-1
2023-03-11,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,Honolulu to Las Vegas,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,big change in quality,False," Hawaiian Airlines used to be good; known for its friendly service and flexible reservations. However, I notice a big change in quality. The reservations person on the phone said that we could get a credit on a ticket we had to change but when I called to make reservations they did not honor the ticket. The staff also made us wait 3 hours on the plane due to plane problems. When I alerted them that they needed to allow us to get off the plane after 3 hours according to Federal guidelines, they got upset. No food or water during the wait. Poor service too.",-1

2023-03-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Lihue via Honolulu,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,shockingly poor experience,False,"  Really shockingly poor experience! Our flight out of Maui was delayed and we ended up missing our connection to Lihue. There was no text notification (like we routinely get with Delta), and the PA announcements don't reach outside the immediate gate area so we didn't hear the page. They got us on another flight, assuring us that the last flight of the day usually waits on folks connecting. We relied on that, but our flight to Lihue did not wait the extra 10 minutes and we were left in Honolulu. They put us up in a seedy ""hotel"" I wouldn't board my dog in (room smelled like a dirty bathroom). Staff on board and in Honolulu could not have cared less, and frankly, I'll take less smiling and ""mahalo"" for efficient customer service.",-1

Cons: You get what you pay for! But I learned my lesson the hard way! Cabin Staff service needs to be much better for first/business class. Please stop calling it Champagne when you are serving prosecco! Ground service Horrible in JFK. I had extra baggage and needed to pay for it. It took four staff 35 minutes to process the payment after being passed on to three different check-in desks. Not a word of apology or regret for having me wait for 35 minutes because they did not know how to do their job! My flight was from JFK to KIX with a night stop in HNL  which I did not ask for). I was told they would not through check my luggage to KIX. I had to retrieve all my six bags in HNL, they do not have storage in Terminal 1. Have to drag luggage all the way to Terminal 2, and it's 20$ a piece for overnight storage. Fellow passengers came to my aid with the difficulty in handling my luggage at HNL but the Hawaiian Airlines staff just shrugged it off despite asking for help. The next day when checking in for my flight to KIX at HNL was told I needed to pay for extra bags again but eventually did not have to after some back-and-forth discussions. For Inflight entertainment, ipads are handed out with not much entertainment in them! The business class lounge was full in HNL with a large majority being Priority Pass members so I had to use one downstairs. the choice of snacks and beverages were unimpressive, when I finally made it on my second go. Hotels are not offered by the airline for the night stop in HNL! Moral of the story: Hawaiian Airlines, never again!",-1

First they delayed my flight for 6 hours. Then at the airport the delayed a flight again for 1 more hour and said that our plain is coming from Vegas.

My husband and I bought round trip tickets to Hawaii and returning to San Francisco in February. The flight to Hawaii was great as always but on the return flight the day before I tried to check us in and it turns out that Hawaiian Airlines canceled our flight tickets - why ? I have no idea. I called Expedia because that’s who we booked with for our vacation package and they said the airline canceled us and that we would get refunded by them (Hawaiian Airlines). We were left with no flight and it was up to us to look for 2 flight tickets so we could go home. 24 hour before our return really? This is so upsetting because the flight was not even canceled it was just our tickets. Ended up spending more money, missing work and not returning home until 2 days after. I’m still waiting for my refund and till this day I don’t know why this happened when I booked and paid 6 months ahead. I will never be relying on Hawaiian Airlines again!",-1

When I called to change the flight to closer to what I originally booked and paid for I was told it was too late and I was misunderstanding. I have never had an airline customer service experience like this one where I was blamed for a schedule change on their end. Do not recommend this airline and will not book again.,-1

2023-01-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Kona to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,You could not pay me to take one of their flights,False,"  I have been traveling for 30 years and can't express with words just how bad my experiences with Hawaiian Airlines have been. My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii every January for the past 15 years and every year I contemplate hiring a boat to take me from island to island rather than dealing with this lousy airline. My most recent experience, I had booked two one-way tickets (Maui - Kona and Kona - Honolulu). My plans changed and I only needed the Kona to Honolulu portion of the trip. Rather than being able to make this change online I used chat, text and three phone calls. After more than 2 hours, I was told by the agent that I had to cancel this ticket and then rebook it completely. I said, ok and asked the agent to rebook the flight for me. I was then told that they couldn't rebook it, but I had to use the credit voucher online. After waiting 48 hours, and no credit voucher appearing in email, I logged in and tried to find the credit. Another two hours of waiting for a chat agent, only to be told that I couldn't book this online and had to speak with an agent. Ok, I call the number....90 minutes later, I'm told that ""because I called an agent, they were going to charge me $25 for each ticket for a processing fee."" So, my ticket that had a value of $116 per person, and I was trying to rebook a new ticket for $39, and I was going to immediately lose the remaining value of the credit, was really only saving me $14 off of just abandoning the original ticket and rebooking online. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my years of traveling. Unfortunately, they have a monopoly when it comes to inter-island travel so you have to use them which I guess is why they can get away with providing such lousy service. You literally could not pay me to take one of their flights out of the Hawaiian islands to their mainland or Asia destinations.",-1

If I didn’t call the seats wouldn’t have been confirmed (we didn’t know this) even though they charged us already. They wanted us to fax a statement over stating the booking was paid for and then call them back to confirm (going through the “system” takes a while to begin with. This is not 1980 Hawaiian Airlines!

The next day Waited for 2 hours just to get our new boarding pass. They tried to charge me $100 just to sit with my wife. At each section in the airport they had one to two people working with up to 50 customers waiting for help. Once we got to the gate they were hostile and undermanned. We tried asking questions about our seats and they told us to ask after they started boarding everyone. Once in the air they brought a food cart that you had to pay for everything, then after that you could get free drinks and a sandwich. No amenities whatsoever where given for free. Headphones, blankets, and real meals you had to buy. They provided movies but expect you to pay for headphones or bring your own.",-1

I booked a flight from Las Vegas to Honolulu and I booked a flight with a different airlines to get from Honolulu to Australia. Right before departure they said that something is wrong with the engine and we have to wait to fix it. They took almost 2 hours and I didn’t see anyone fixing anything! Due to this, I missed my flight to Australia because of the time of landing! I basically lost around $2500 because I had book another ticket to Australia and also book a hotel room plus food for that night! I was trying to talk to the staff for more than 3 hours at the airport and they kept sending here and there without any solution!

It took them over an hour to figure it and in total 2hr delays. On the way back we had technical issues, engine stretch or something (different model). I am not sure how good their maintenance on this airplane are but it’s clearly a problem. We are not frequent flyers with Hawaiian Airlines but people who sits around us said it happens often. Just very sad how no one cares to fix the maintenance issues instead of going through this all the time! What’s the chances that both our flights in days difference had technical issues.",-1

I cancelled out of the site, waited to make sure I didn’t get an email saying the reservation went through, and several hours later went back to the site and booked the trip. The next day I got two emails with two different reservations. I called Hawaiian and the agent told me that they could cancel the ticket but not refund it. I asked if it could be used as credit toward a hotel stay and was told that it could. When I tried to redeem the credit the agent told me that it could only be used toward a flight. Hawaiian doesn’t even fly out of DFW so I lost $350. Had they been honest the first phone call I could have potentially used the credit some other way. I will never, ever fly Hawaiian Airlines again.",-1
2022-11-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kahalui to Honolulu,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,Don't expect any sort of service,False,  My wife and I flew an inter-island flight from Maui to Honolulu in Nov 22. Although the flight was delayed the experience onboard was fine. Upon arrival into Honolulu one of our bags didn't make it. The man at the Honolulu Hawaiian airlines baggage desk was super rude and quite frankly it felt like he didn't even want to serve us. We filed a 'irregular baggage report' and did the standard protocol. The man at the desk said they would call first thing the following day and let us know our bag whereabouts. The next morning we received no call so decided to call the aiport as we where staying 1.5 hours from the airport. We were put on hold for 3.5 hours and then 2 hours where no one picked up the phone. The following day was the same! On hold for 3 hours and no answer. When someone finally answered they said they had found the bag and would send it out immediately. 2 days later we still hadn't received the bag and once again couldn't get through on the phone to anyone at the airport. We ended up driving to the airport where there were 3 staff working on the hawaiian airline baggage desk not serving anyone talking amongst themselves. When I asked why no one was answering their phone they all laughed. My bottom line! Don't expect any sort of service at all with Hawaiian airlines... especially if something goes wrong.,-1
2022-11-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Honolulu to Kona,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,surprised at the poor customer service,False," I'm not one to leave reviews but feel the need to warn people away from this airline. As someone who travels domestically and internationally very regularly I was surprised at the poor customer service and ""gotcha"" approach with flight changes. I made an error with booking inter-island transit and within 15 minutes tried to change it only to be told that customer service was unwilling to do so based on the ""fare rules."" mind you it was a first class ticket that had been changed once to this new island and by accident I got the wrong airport. This was disappointing and frustrating and, from my experience, not in line with industry standards for any other American or international carrier I have used (aside from deeply discounted budget brands). Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. You don't want to be in my situation where an error caught in 15 minutes means you forfeit your $$$. So many other airlines fly to Hawaii and actually have some basic standards of customer service. The money grab really feels inconsistent with the beautiful culture of Hawaii. How disappointing.",-1

Booked a flight a year out and paid 345 each extra for extra comfort seats. 670 dollars. Went to check in the day before the flight and not only were my partner and I not even in the same area of the plane, we lost extra comfort. Called customer service and was told for over an hour our seats were gone and there was nothing they could do. Told us someone else had our seats. Then paid 270 per seat (540) to re upgrade and was told I would be reimbursed if I spoke with agents at Logan. They then told me I would have to call customer service. Kept going back and forth and both were useless, rude and zero help. Was told ""don't worry"" this won't happen 10 days later your seats are good to go. Checked in 10 days later and had same issue. They have literally stolen over a thousand dollars from me and just could not care less. Will never fly them again or recommend them to anyone. A terrible experience from start to finish.",-1
2022-11-04,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Honolulu,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,I won’t fly with them anymore,True,"  I’ve had so many problem with Hawaiian over the years that I had to write a review at this point. It started with them canceling my husbands and I’s flight during Covid and not offering any sort of voucher for a last minute hotel. If you can imagine, getting a hotel day of on Honolulu is the worst. Talk about cockroaches and a nasty bed. Not to mention being put on hold for 3 hours only to give up, call back later and be put on hold again for hours. That was in 2021. Later that year we purchased tickets and they were unable to check us in as though our tickets never even existed. que going to the “services” line in the Honolulu airport and coming close to missing our flight - not because we weren’t early but because the wait in the line was nearly out the door. And the employee barely knew what she was doing so everything took forever. If you’re unable to do the job properly you need more training. Now I go to check in in 2022 and they got rid of the check in lines all together and have kiosks and people walking around- you weigh your own bag etc. remember this is all at the Honolulu location. If you have an issue- just go wait in a line for hours and miss your flight. They got rid of free check in bags for military spouses (no other airline does this) the customer service said because they have “issues” with people sneaking bags or something - no, it’s clearly cutting corners. Active duty personnel is still allowed to have free checked bags but they have to go to the line that take 3 hours to simply have one checked bag. So they make you really contemplate if that free checked bag is worth missing your flight! Also all of this with no heads up with changed in policy’s. Unfortunately I already booked multiple flights with them the next month because they pop up the cheapest. But out of principal and their treatment of military and corner cutting I won’t fly with them anymore. Military and their spouses already have a hard enough time traveling around, paying for way more flights than normal people, so it’s clear how they feel about military. And before anyone says anything about military occupation, we all Know big corporations don’t care about that. They just want their $30 dollars, and to make sure they hire as little employees as possible. Also the seats are squished together so even as a small woman I’m shoulder to shoulder with people and can barely move. It was a nightmare trying to get comfortable",-1
2022-11-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Honolulu to New York,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5,ruined the whole experience,True," Before my flight I called Hawaiian airlines to get an approval to use my cpap machine on the plane each way from New York JFK to Honolulu. The woman told me I would have to upgrade my seat because coach does not have outlets but extra comfort does have them so I had to pay over $900 for upgrade for my wife and I to use my medical device. Only allowed 100 watts for a battery and that’s not enough to run a cpap machine. Flight from JFK to HNL no problem used the machine 5 star. Return flight from HNL to JFK I was told cpap machines are not allowed on the plane. I told the lady I was approved to use it. They called the supervisor and he said it is a safety issue I cannot use it. I said it is only a safety issue if it is used in the emergency exit, and this is not where I am sitting. Told him I was allowed to use it on flight 51 on the way to HNL. He said no I cannot use my machine on an overnight flight, my throat literally closes up from snoring. After reading Hawaiian Airlines rules it clearly says rule number 8 cpap is a medical device and allowed to be used. It's a shame this ruined the whole experience of flying with Hawaiian airlines because all the rest of the staff was great. Paid the for the seats so I can use the cpap.",-1

When arriving to Hawaii our baggage was lost and not one employee could care about our lost luggage. We contacted managers, employees and multiple people and not one person was compassionate, empathetic, cared or took the time of the day to follow up on this with us.

Booked an 8:10am flight that left the gate 15 minutes early and left us behind due to TSA checks. We tried to board and they told us too bad it’s gone and out bags we’re already on the flight and gave us a number to call. We called reservations and went rounds for over an hour and a half! During that time they changed the flight prices on us 3 different times! After trying to get ahold of a manager and refusing to transfer we finally were forced to book the only flight they had. Cost us $2500 when it shouldn’t have been more than $100! Not only that but they took so long to get us situation we almost missed a 2nd flight! When we boarded the plane we were informed they don’t offer wifi which was a huge disappointment for a long flight! Emailed corporate to complain and they wrote me a sorry letter basically refusing to refund me and offer flight credits knowing I’ll never use them!

2022-09-23,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Los Angels to Honolulu,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,1,customer service incredibly bad,True,"  Where do I begin… arrived at airport before start of boarding. Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said that’s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats… If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well… nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. We’ll it happens… Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- “So, what are the options now?”. Answer now is “You’ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and it’s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning… what are my options? Answer was “well you can take the room and voucher or not… that’s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, we’re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was “file a complaint”. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty. Food was by far the worse I’ve had on an airplane, and almost all levels of customer service were incredibly bad. I’ve never seen an airline with staff so uninterested in what they do. I do have to note their in-cabin crew was very nice. They seemed to have truly tried to help. Everyone else was god-awful. Remember… if this was my experience in first class, what would it be for folks in the other seats?",-1

I tried to check in and and baggage for my flights the day before when I received the email reconfirming my flight. It would not allow me. So I called. The customer service rep told me the amount I had paid for said flight was just to ""place my flight on standby"" and the 2 seats I purchased were not actually confirmed. He said this may have been a computer glitch because this never happens or sometimes with HA this happens because people want to pay their taxes for the flight at the airport. This has never happened before with any other airline I have used. I received no notice that my flight was not confirmed, instead I received the opposite that my flights were confirmed. If I had not called I may have gone to the airport to find out there were no more available seats on the flight (customer service rep told me this). This is crazy. I paid another $100 something for taxes. At first I thought it was a scam, but realized that didn't make sense because they had the correct flight info and my info before I have it to them. So thank God it wasn't a scam, but risked almost missing 2 flights on my honeymoon because of a ""computer glitch"" or failure to contact me to let me know my flight was not confirmed. None of this makes any sense. Customer service rep was very nice and worked with me. But extremely frustrating and still do not understand how this happened",-1

2022-08-26,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Honolulu,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,thank you Hawaiian for a job well done,True,"  Boarding at JFK's Terminal 4 orderly and efficient. Seats comfortable for the nine hour flight back to Honolulu. The cabin crew was awesome with their food and snack service. The complimentary wine with the meals is a nice touch albeit the only course was a vegetarian pasta dish with salad and cookie. The snack prior to landing was good as well, especially with the mac-nut chocolate included. The flight itself was extremely smooth with very little turbulence along the way. Of the various airline pilots from different companies which I have flown, HA pilots make the smoothest landings, well appreciated. HA's entertainment could use more varieties of movies, and definitely a wi-fi system on board which HA has none. All in all thank you Hawaiian for a job well done. Hawaii truly does fly with Hawaiian.",1

Despite being a single aisle aircraft, Hawaiian delivers on this route. Great seats and legroom are accompanied by warm efficient service. Warm greetings and consistent attention really make the difference. They served a very good substantial warm lunch with a separate dessert course. F/A’s were constantly making rounds offering top off’s etc. Only negative is no wi fi. Compared to the competition…well there is none. Tired of the tight spaces and dour faces on the other carriers.",1
2022-08-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hilo to Lihue,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,attendants on Hawaiian just watch,True,"  I fly interisland often in Hawaii and have flown with both Hawaiian and Southwest. SW has them beat by a long shot. SW flight crew actually assist with boarding on the plane, greeting you as you board, ensuring carry ons in the overhead compartments are placed neatly, this makes a big difference in shortening the boarding process. Flight attendants on Hawaiian just watch as passengers take their time wondering which compartments they should pick. This just prolongs the boarding process so if u have a tight connection it just makes it stressful. And you can't beat the price and service for flying SW. Sorry HAL, there's a new kid on the block.",-1
2022-08-21,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Honolulu,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,literally offered zero service,True,"  I will never choose Hawaiian airline anymore in my life. Both the ground and cabin staffs literally offered zero service! There were other couple things that happened and made me angry. But today I will particularly talk about a young male attendant who was on HA 21 from Seattle to Honolulu on August 20 morning. I asked him for a Coke while he was serving food and drinks, but then I politely asked him to exchange it for a zero. I used all sorts of polite words when I asked him, so I didn't feel I had offended him in any way. But he reacted to me with extreme impatience. He even stopped, looked at me and let out a loud sigh. I told him I was sorry when he changed it for me. But then the more I thought about it, the angrier I got, because it wasn't my fault at all, and he had no reason to be impatient with a small request from a customer. I can understand that he might have this irritable personality but I don't think that's the kind of personality that can work in the service industry. If he could read this post, he would know I was talking about him. I really want to hear an apology from him.",-1

We called ahead of time and asked to make sure our 2 year old, who had his own ticket and seat, was seated next to his parents. When we got to the gate and asked the gate agent why our tickets were not together, they could not give us a good reason. The gate agents began barking orders to us as if we were the cause of the confusion. After we boarded, still without having at least one parent next to our 2 year old, the flight attendants continued to be rude and unhelpful. They said it was ridiculous that these seats were not together. We agreed but no one would fix it. It is absolutely stupid that we should have to request a second time to have one parent by a two year old who has a purchased ticket when we called ahead of time and were reassured our child had a parent by him. Fortunately, there were kind passengers that happily changed seats. The flight attendants did nothing except stand together in a stupor.",-1
2022-08-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Honolulu,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,refused to cover any costs,False,"  My fiancé and I chose to fly Hawaiian Airlines for our first trip to Honolulu and had back-to-back issues with them. On our initial flight from Seattle to Honolulu, they lost our luggage. We were told by baggage claim services that we had to call the number we were given to talk to someone about what to do, but that our bags were most likely stuck in Seattle. After being on hold with the number they provided us for over an hour before even speaking to a single representative, we gave up with them. They eventually called us way later to inform us that our bags had been at the Honolulu Airport the whole time, but had been delivered to the wrong place. We finally got our bags back. On our flight back from Honolulu to Seattle, our flight with Hawaiian was so late that we missed our connecting flight. Hawaiian was so unhelpful and refused to cover any costs, accommodation, or anything. We couldn't afford a hotel and ended up having to sit at the Seattle airport for around 5 1/2 hours till family members were able to drive all the way to the Seattle airport to get us before we had to drive roughly three hours to our hometown. Such a ridiculously stressful experience, on top of which: my in-flight entertainment screen never worked on EITHER flight we had with them, there were zero vegetarian options for the free meal they provide for ""dinner"" (not everyone eats pork, Hawaiian!), and the stewardesses seemed incredibly inconvenienced by the simplest of requests. Passengers shouldn't be treated this way when they pay a ridiculous amount to be on that flight.",-1

2022-07-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Seattle to Kahului,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Stay away from this company,False,"  I just had a terrible experience with Hawaiian Airlines, after being their loyal customer for so long. My husband and I was offered multiple times a companion ticket discount of $100 but when I tried to use it online, it errored out, the website asked me to call their customer service and provided a phone number. I called in, explained that their website keeps error out upon using the discount. The rep told me that they ""are aware of it"", Reasonably enough, she offered to give me one time courtesy of not charging me $25 for using the phone service. Not until the price they offered me is ~$200 extra per person than the web pricing! Luckily, I did the math, and told her that, with the price they are offering me, I am probably better off buying the same tickets online without the $100 companion discount - What a trap! I insisted she to talk with her manager for at least matching the website pricing since I had to call in due to their website error. About an hour later, the rep did call me back, offering a much lower pricing than their first offer. I made the purchase. Only then, I noticed, adding taxes and everything, the actual discount I got is only $61 than my original website pricing, not the $100 discount as their ""earned discount"" offer of $100. Their explanation is: The base pricing for the ticket, since our phone conversation to get the $100 discount took so long (~3 hours), has gone up from $496.56 to $562! So, the actual cost for me to call in is more than the $25 phone change cost since their website didn't work. Yes, the website problem which should cost them in fact cost me instead! Yes, while they are claiming ""No change fee"" yet there is a $25 phone service charge upon anything you want to change, too! What a lying, cheating, blood-sucking company! They charge for every turn, every little thing including their mistakes, too (website error)! Stay away from this company, if you can! They are in blood-sucking mode right now!",-1
2022-07-26,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Honolulu,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3,poor quality offerings,True,"  Phoenix to Honolulu. In order to enjoy a trip from Paradise home, one must pass through the gates of purgatory, which is another word for Hawaiian Airlines within the Daniel Inouye airport in Honolulu. For two seniors traveling with luggage, this was an excruciating experience. The three separate (and long) lines needing to endure just in order to check baggage was senseless. The walk from the main terminal to the gate to the departure area might as well have been from downtown Waikiki, which might have been more pleasant. And then there's the food onboard. Or more precisely, the absence of anything worthwhile to consume. Fortunately we learned our lesson on the outbound flight after going hungry for about eight hours. We packed a good lunch and snacks and were then able to bypass the airline's poor quality offerings.",-1
2022-07-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Lihue,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,providing well below average service,True,"  Thank you very much for providing me with a horrible service and ruining my honeymoon.  I used Hawaiian airlines for inter-island transfers and they were never on time, always late. I had a day trip to Maui and they started loading cargos after all passengers had completed boarding, thankfully it only took about 20 minutes or so. On 07/23/22, there was an issue on a plane and all passengers had to deplane and take another flight. i planned a day trip to Kauai departing Honolulu at 7am and coming back at 6 pm. however, because of the delay, now i have to cancel all booked activities. The airplane is still not departing (as of 7/23/22 8:40 am). One good thing about Hawaiian airlines is they are very consistent - they are very consistent in providing well below average service. They don't let you down when providing poor services. They are never sorry for anything. I have another upcoming island excursion to the big island. i hope not to get the same consistent service.",-1
2022-07-08,0.6,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kahului to Honolulu,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,3,Such a bad customer service,True,"  Kahului Airport. I was traveling with two kids and an infant. We got our bag tagged and only seen my infant’s paper ticket. Upon checking in my bag and my daughters car seat, the lady who assisted us kept yelling at me for a good 6 mins bc I didn’t see my ticket printed and it dropped on the ground. I was about to show her my e-ticket and she did not even bother and told me she didn’t need that and she demanded the paper ticket. She literally kept yelling at me trying to explain how she needed the “ticket” in order for “her” to scan. She told me to go back to the self service to check if I dropped my ticket in which she could have just easily printed it herself because she had already verified my ID. I went back and grabbed my ticket from the floor and gave it to her. She then told me she didn’t need it because she will print a new set of tickets.  Such a bad customer service, rude and disrespectful AF. She shouldn’t be in a customer service industry with that rude attitude of hers.",1

We had to wait in a 2 hour long queue before boarding. My parents aged 75+ are diabetic. There was no Vegan / Vegetarian food option on the flight and the attendant didn't care about not having food for us on a 5 1/2+ hour journey. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.,-1
2022-07-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Maui,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,Terrible customer service,False,"  Hawaiian Airlines is great for flying, but terrible customer service. My wife has been on the phone with them about once every 2 months for the past year trying to get her name changed on her Hawaiian Airlines account. The customer service tells her to do the same thing every time and that she will be contacted within 24 hours. She never gets a return email, call, nothing. She just got off of the phone with them and the representative told her to literally just hope that it gets done this time. She asked to speak with someone else and was denied. This is literally never going to get resolved. Terrible customer service.",-1
2022-06-30,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Honolulu,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2,What deceptive business practices,True," So utterly disappointed. I booked my ticket under the airlines website's promise of ""no change fee"". After calling to change my travel dates due to work, turns out there is a change fee. Furthermore, the fare differential to make the travel date change is higher than if I were to rebook a new ticket. That's just great AI driven pricing software. What deceptive business practices. Hawaiian Airlines has one of the very best cabin service in my opinion. Yet, their ticketing and customer service, which is farmed out to a 3rd world call center staffed by 5th world personnel, seems substandard compared to other airlines. Emptor Caveat. Buyer Beware. Behind that warm aloha spirit, they are still a money making machine first and foremost, customer service be damned.",1

There were three lines: one for first class, one said “main cabin” and the third one for dropping the bags. We waited in the main cabin line for 30 minutes because the airline representatives were extremely slow. And when it was our turn to check in, we were asked to wait because there were people in the first class line. Apparently, first class passengers get a priority in the main cabin line as well. We tried to ask but Hawaiian representatives very surprisingly rude. I’ve never had such experience with airlines in USA. Will never use them again.",-1

The crew were nice and smiling and they offered welcome drinks an IPad for flight entertainment and a breakfast which was ok. Nothing special about it but adequate service over all. However the aircraft was old and the first class seat when fully recline is not comfortable at all for a sleep. Luckily it was a morning flight and didn’t need to sleep. The highlight was the friendly smiling crew of Hawaiian something is missing in all other US carriers. And being a full service airline domestically even though they fly from international terminals.,1

Best part is entertainment options are good especially with kids staff and all crew members are good too. One request to all airlines when someone traveling with kids give them seats that are comfortable for them with kids because some people are really rude during flights they don’t want any noise. They don’t understand that kids can’t keep quiet for 5, 6 hours sometimes it’s really hard for those who are traveling with kids.",1

Paid for premium economy and was no different than economy. Same seats, same food and we were told we could not stretch our legs because the area in front of our seats was considered a walk way. Booked 6 months in advance and chose flight based on available seats. When we were boarding instead of the front row we reserved they changed our seats to the back. Unacceptable!",-1

We came from the mainland and visited Oahu so we thought of visiting Hilo island. Flight from Honolulu to Hilo was good - at check-in, the name on the boarding pass didn't match as ID and TSA requested me to go visit Guest Services; they rectified the issue quickly. Boarding was quick and efficient. For a 35 minute flight passionfruit juice was served which was adequate. Flight took off on time, crew was very efficient in the service. Likewise for Hilo to Honolulu sector. Recommend Hawaiian for short inter island flights!!",1
2022-05-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,Orlando to Honolulu,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,Little about this flight was impressive,True,"  We recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and we wanted to fly to HNL, where we spent our Honeymoon. We purchased First Class R/T tickets on Hawaiian Airlines. Not much about the experience was impressive, and I wish we'd given that $7,000 to the Ukrainian war effort. The agent gave us the gate number but said nothing about the need to line up at the gate and be checked in for a wrist band to avoid having to get screened once we arrived in HNL. About 20 minutes prior to departure we realized that people were queuing up and receiving wrist bands, so we got in line. After having been in line for about 15 minutes, the same agent who had taken our bag at the ticket counter advised those of us still in line that it was too late to be issued a wrist band and walked away. Not only had all of the extensive online pre-clearance effort been a waste of time but we only ended up boarding the flight a few minutes before the doors were closed prior to departure. I was livid before we left the gate and worked hard to not let such a poor showing on their part ruin our vacation before we left the ground. Little about this flight was impressive. The lie-flat seats belong not in first class but in an intermediate class of service. They are 6 abreast in the cabin. The lack of wi-fi at this juncture is inexcusable. iPads for entertainment? Really? Were we eligible to use the first-class lounge? What about the frequent flyer miles? Where would we find them, and can we have Delta FFMs instead? And then there was the food. Two chicken thighs with the skin on in a forgettable sauce was in-edible for me, I never eat dark-meat poultry. That was the extent of the food until breakfast, which wasn't much better. There were no snacks served in between on a flight exceeding 10 hours. Had my wife not brought her extensive survival rations that she typically takes when she flies to Asia, we would have been starving by the time we got to HNL. The return flight was equally pathetic--essentially Chef Boy-R-Dee ravioli without the sauce. It was tasteless and so dry we couldn't eat it all, and it was not a generous serving. Breakfast: also pathetic, we stopped and ate at First Watch on the way home. Like the food, the service was forgettable. Actually, it was nearly non-existent. If you don't ring a call button you won't see a Flight Attendant between meal services. Beverage choice in First Class is quite limited. Hawaiian offers a level of service that resembles Southwest Airlines. Do not under any circumstances purchase a first class ticket. Neither their Agents nor Flight Attendants are trained to provide that level of service. Their cabin interiors are dated and not adequately maintained. There is no WiFi. In Flight entertainment is via iPad, which must be purchased in coach. There is little customer service available from the company - virtually nothing in real time. I've been waiting for a response from them via their website for over a month, which is why I elected to post this online. We liked the fact that we could fly non-stop between Orlando and Honolulu; for less money we could have flown on Delta and, given the lengthy maintenance delay on our return flight we would have spent no more time had we connected in any of their hubs. Bottom line: Don't expect Delta Service on Hawaiian Airlines.",-1

Super long walk (20 min?) to gates. There are small carts available for part of the walk. Upon return, to get to baggage claim takes even longer and is very difficult with multiple escalators.

Only the ticketing and customer service are excellent. The flight's service was appalling. There was no options for vegetarian and vegan. I just napped on the plane from Honolulu to Las Vegas while they served dinner. They didn't bother to call me. When I inquired about food after 5 minutes, they abruptly informed me that no food will be served at this time. The strangest thing is that if I purchase with a credit card, they would deliver the food. This is inexcusable. During the journey, I only received a small amount of juice. The flight attendant was quite haughty and unprofessional. In general, they treat passengers as though they are travelling free of cost. In the future, I would not fly with Hawaiian Airlines.",-1
2022-04-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they provided no service,False,"  Firstly, during the booking of the flight the reservationist confirmed that the tickets were for comfort plus seating. Upon arrival to gate, was advised that seats were standard cabin and would need to upgraded to comfort plus but unfortunately nothing was now available. We asked about upgrading to first class and was told we'd have to enter a bid. Sounded odd but this was the first time using this airline so not understanding. During the flight my seat was broken, reclined during take off and throughout the flight making it a very unsafe, uncomfortable and a frustrating flight. In additional to not having the seats we preferred, a seat that was broken, the stewardess had a open bottle of water with no cap and spilled water on my fiancée as she was attempting to give her trash wetting her entire left side blouse. She apologized but this only added to frustration. Upon arriving to the destination, we immediately went to check-in to advise of the trip and inquire about either upgrading to Comfort Plus, First Class or cancelling return flight. Was advised we'd need to contact reservations. This is the first time using Hawaiian Airlines, the first leg of our trip and would never use again especially considering the fact that when we called, they provided no service and didn't bother to do anything to fix the problem or accommodate our return flight.",-1
2022-03-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Naha to Honolulu,3.0,,3.0,,1.0,3.0,1,Customer service is the worst,False,"  Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced relative to other airlines. Their ""live chat"" is worthless and its near impossible to rebook a ticket. You can't do it yourself if it involves more than one city which is absurd. Changing a ticket booking because the airline canceled flight is a basic level of service that I should be able to do from my phone. If you are going to force me to have a representative to rebook my ticket then provide representatives that are available! I spent days waiting on phone lines and ""Live Chat"" rooms for such a simple task. If the tickets weren't so overpriced, I would of dumped the money and rebooked with another airline. I have no issues with the actual planes, flight attendants or workers of Hawaiian airlines but the company needs serious restructuring of its customer facing services.",-1

However, when I booked a flight then cancelled it - it was literally like pulling teeth to get a refund. The agents for Hawaiian Airlines seem ill prepared and undertrained to handle any situation. Needless to say, this experience has made me tell everyone I know about what to expect when booking with this airline.",-1

Bought 2 one way tickets on Alaska airlines which was great. Then when leaving on Hawaiian our flights had been canceled. After an hour fixing that we were seated next to a screaming kid. We asked for ear plugs and the FA said sure but never brought them. So for 5 hours we would doze off and be awoken by a screaming kid. My first trip to Hawaii ended as the worse day of my life.,-1

You will spend hours to get the most basic support like rescheduling a ticket. There call center lines occasionally out source to some foreign countries with people who barely speak English and it’s very disappointing. Hawaiian for then last decade used to be my preferred airlines, but with the death of island air and corporate greed caused by COVID you're better off flying Delta or Southwest. Very disappointed with how this company has destroyed its customer service credibility over a few thousand dollars? Corporate greed at it’s finest.",-1
2022-03-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kahului,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Terrible experience,False, Honolulu to Kahului. Terrible experience trying to get refund for canceling travel for medical reason. We thought the mask mandate would be over when we booked our flight. Due to high blood pressure and retina vein occlusion and some loss of eyesight my husband cannot wear a mask for 14 hours. We thought the mandate would be over by now so called to cancel. The will not give a refund or rescheduled. Reschedule has to be in 3 months which we cannot get back by then and hope for mandates to end by then either. We were charged almost $400 to go one way for two of us between HNL and Maui. Refund for situations that you cannot control are non-existent and prices rather high. No consideration for doctor report of risk for flying extended time with mask.,-1
2022-02-25,0.7,Solo Leisure,First Class,Honolulu to Los Angeles,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4,I love Hawaiian airlines,True," Honolulu to Los Angeles. The trip from LAX to Honolulu was superb. The food was amazing, the service was wonderful, and the lay-flat seats were glorious. I am grateful for their mask and vaccine mandate as it made me feel safer since this is my first time traveling again since Feb of 2020. The trip back from Honolulu to LAX was good, but this time the food was disgusting. They are supposed to have some serious chefs that do their food and I would have given them kudos for the first trip. But the food coming back tasted about as good as it looked. It was supposed to be coq au vin (wine-braised chicken) with green onion chickpea cake. Well, the chicken was the stuff you leave after stripping away the meat from the chicken - the left-over giblets with gristle, fat, and skin. Yuk. The green onion cake had absolutely no flavor at all. You might as well have eaten a piece of the polyester pillow. And those little bitter mushroom things that looked like worms? What are they thinking? Seriously. A true chef understands that there must not only be flavor, there must be a visual appeal. This meal ruined the entire trip and tasted about as good as it looked. I nearly got sick to my stomach. My mother (who usually eats anything) also thought it was repulsive. YUK!! Overall I love Hawaiian airlines and I would fly with them again but they need to get a grip on the food. To Hawaiian Airlines: When you try too hard to give people the ""fru fru"" stuff you miss the ball altogether. Give us some meat with veggies and a vegan option and call it good. No need for the weird stuff. And you'll save some money by avoiding expensive disgusting ingredients too. Stick to the basics. A happy tummy is a happy customer.",1
2022-02-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Honolulu,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,Worst customer experience calling them,True,"  Not really specific for the flight information provided above, but when I tried to travel the next time (tried to book / cancel). On my previous trip, the flight was delayed by 12+ hours. Due to this, we received travel credits of $300 each for the next flights. Now trying to use this credit to book the trip, and wasted hours and hours due to it. Booked a flight that is 2-3 months away from now to KOA (Kona airport), so I thought the ticket price would be pretty stable. We booked the flight through the Hawaiian website, used up all the credit to save up so we ended up paying $118 each (it was $418 - $300 credit). The next day, we saw the price dropped to $358 per ticket, so we contacted customer service (the call was on hold 30+ min) to either get our price matched or cancel the flight. The customer service representative said I can get $418 full refunded to my credit card, which really didn't make sense so I confirmed it multiple multiple times and the associate confirmed that that is going to be the case. After a week, I only see $118 posted on my card. Contacted them again waiting 30+min again, they said they did refund $418 to the card and asked me to contact my credit card bank to confirm the refund amount. Did that and American Express confirmed that they only see $118 from Hawaiian. Called Hawaiian again, holding 30+ min again, and finally, they transferred to the supervisor (which took another 30+ min). Finally, the supervisor says they cannot do a full refund since $300 was charged by travel credit, and they can re-send the travel credit via email. I complained about my wasted time and also told him to please educate the customer service associate about this non-refundable travel credit information so people like me don't have to waste their precious time, and the supervisor just hung up on me without any answer! I don't know when or whether I'll be receiving my credit, and I really don't want to call them again for the credit not received yet, but I may have to. Worst customer experience calling them, never had a clean flight with them, plus they are usually more expensive than other airlines, so I'd highly highly recommend flying with some other airline.",-1
2022-02-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kahului,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,attendants were all very nice and cheerful,True,"  Used Hawaiian Airlines for a day trip on Tuesday 02/15/22 from HNL to OGG to visit hubby's family there. Hawaiian Airlines use all of Terminal 1 in HNL airport. Announcements were made frequently regarding flight status and gate updates, really good. Boarding is quite organized and people were called to board by zones. The airplane for flight HA 216 was N488HA, a 23 years old B712. We opted for the over wing emergency exit with extra legroom. The seats are very standard plastic backed type and at the emergency exit the tray tables were located in the armrest. However since the trip only takes minutes we don't really have the need for the tray table. We only bring our backpacks for the flight and were able to put them under the seat in front of us. The overhead bins are on the small side, and based on its size can accommodate slimmer carryon only. We depart around 15 minutes later than schedule (which is a big deal for the 20-30 minutes inter island flights like these) however we land around 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight attendants were all very nice and cheerful, and within a short 20-25 minutes flight were able to serve us drink (water or a delicious POG juice cocktail - Passion fruit-Orange-Guava) and collect all the trash within minutes, and we are ready for landing.",1
2022-02-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kahului to Honolulu,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,enjoyed our flight with them,True,"  We flew Hawaiian Airlines back to HNL after a day trip to Kahului to visit hubby's cousin there. The flight HA 395 OGG-HNL was using N484HA, a 23 years old B712. The incoming airplane arrived early but there was still another airplane at its designated gate; and after waiting for a few minutes they were able to use a different gate so there will be no delay. A relief, since we have to catch a flight out from HNL later that night. Boarding was quite orderly and we were boarded by zones. The flight left on time and arrived in HNL around 10 minutes early. The FAs in this flight were very nice and cheerful, and they have good interactions with the passengers. Within 20-25 minutes flight the FAs were able to serve water or juice for passengers, collect all the trash and getting ready to land again. Hawaiian Airlines is a good airline to use for short island hop trips like this, and we enjoyed our flight with them.",1

Never will I ever fly Hawaiian airlines even if they let me fly for free! Our family was stop at the boarding gate because we had shopping bags and purse, saying they only allow 1 carry on 1 personal items. So if you went shopping they count that as a personal item so you can’t bring it on the plane. Doesn’t everyone go shopping for souvenirs? How is one suppose to bring it back? How about food n snacks if you carry the snack in your hands it’s also consider as a personal item. Even my small Fanny pack was consider a personal item so I ask what do they want me to do they rudely reply as “that’s for you to figure out!” While rolling their eyes. Never will I fly Hawaiian Airlines.",-1

2022-01-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to New York,,,,,,,1,never book with Hawaiian again,True,"  Booking with Hawaiian is a nightmare. Tried booking on the website using our Hawaiian miles but couldn’t because of a website error. Had to call and book the reservation instead. Took 3 hours just to get through to someone. Finally was able to book the reservation only to see that my card was charge 3 times. Called again, waited 4 hours, tossed around from operator to operator each one telling me they were unable to refund. After 12 hours finally got to someone who told me they could request a refund for me. Fine.  Two days later I see they charge me 2 more times! And the nightmare continues. Once again calling and being told they cannot refund me. I will never book with Hawaiian again.",-1
2022-01-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kona,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,HAL got us where we needed - eventually,True," We had booked a multi-leg trip through Delta that used ""Partner"" Hawaiian Airlines (HAL) between islands. For their part, HAL got us where we needed - eventually...but not without a lot of wasted vacation time and unnecessary anxiety. 1) An hour before check-in for the next day's flight to Kona we get a text from HAL that our flight was cancelled. Okay, cutting slack for COVID or whatever reason (none was given) we were still worried about how to continue the next leg of our trip. We had no place to stay if we couldn't travel, and expensive reservations waiting the next day. They gave us a Toll-Free number to ""call"", after hours of trying, all we got was busy signal and we never got through. There was no way to rebook on HAL website, since ticketing was through Delta. So, spending 4 hours on hold getting through to Delta we rebooked for a later HAL flight - but had to pay fare difference, even though it wasn't our fault we had to make a flight change. 2) Arriving at the airport, HAL was a mess. Although our reservation included checked bags, they insisted we had to pay because, ""we're not Delta Airlines."" I get that, but we paid Delta - who already paid HAL for our seats and baggage. 3) Finally getting on the plane, there were a ton of open seats. My guess is the earlier cancellation wasn't COVID related, just saving expense to consolidate flights. We were in Economy seats and after boarding, all Exit Rows were open. On any other airline, we've been allowed to move to open seats, but not on HAL. At first, the flight attendant said we couldn't sit there because of Exit Row requirements. I responded, ""as long as we meet Exit Row requirements, why can't we sit there?"" His response, ""more money."" I get it, they market them as Premium seating. After cancelled flights, additional charges and vacation time lost, the least HAL could have done was let us sit there. The Customer Service value would cost them nothing. No. Who sat there instead? Uniformed HAL employees, probably being repositioned. I'm not begrudging that staff deserves to be treated well, but aren't we the paying customers? Through everything it seemed the message HAL was sending was, we don't need you - you need us - so live with it. Easy fix - Obviously, HAL had our cell numbers, because they texted us that the flight was cancelled, due to low occupancy. It would have been easier for them to simply put us on another flight and tell us of the time change. Better yet, since there were only about 30 people booked, they could have called us. Rather than have us keep calling their toll-free and never getting through, one of their agents could have called us (same amount of time on the phone for their agents). We paid a premium for everything on this trip, costs were about 30% higher than in the past. We knew that going in. The cost of more than a half-day of lost vacation time and toll of having your itinerary cancelled mid-trip - priceless.",-1
2022-01-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Hilo,,,,,,,1,Impossible to reach customer service,True,"  Impossible to reach customer service. They canceled my flight but I can't reach anyone to receive a refund. When I did finally get someone on the phone, the call was disconnected before a refund was processed. They didn't call me back and the wait to speak to a representative no matter when I call is almost two hours long. I've tried both chat and text customer service options. They responded over 36 hours later when I was asleep and closed the thread before I responded a couple hours later. This has happened three times! Not even given a chance to respond and I still do not have a flight or a refund!",-1

I had a 4 hour layover and needed to recheck my bags since i was transferring airlines. I spent an hour getting to Hawaiian Airlines check in since is in a different terminal? I guess Hawaiian Airlines with international flights instead of the domestic where i landed. I got there with my 5 bags from my extended trip and the check in was closed! Apparently they close 30min after each flight and open 2.5 hours before each flight. So I'm stuck here till 11:30pm for them to reopen. It shouldn’t have to take two hours to recheck bags.

2021-11-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Sacramento,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,worst experience on this airline,True,"  I had the worst experience on this airline. I am 18 years old and have flown quite a bit, both internationally and within the US. I am a female and I was on my period. I had run out of some stuff and needed to get to my sister who had some feminine products in her bag. She was on the other side of the plane all the way to the back. I quickly made my way back there trying to not get into anyone’s way. When I got there the flight attendants were getting ready to do the food runs so I moved out of their way. When I was ready to go back they were in the way so I sat in an empty seat to talk to my sister. I was then told I had to go back to my seat. I informed the flight attendant that I would as soon as they weren’t in the way of the isle. She argued for a bit then finally left it alone. As soon as the isle was clear I went back to my seat but was stopped by a flight attendant physically blocking my path and stopping me with her hand. I told her I wasn’t going to walk through there again and just was getting something from my sister. She then accused me of going back and forth over 3 times. I corrected her and she continued to complain about what i was doing even though I was not causing any problems. After the flight my sister told me she had also had issues with a different flight attendant. That makes 3 different attendants who were rude. When we got my sisters bag out of baggage claim it was soaked and the metal badge had been ripped off. They honestly were so rude and unkind it was shocking. I have never written a bad review because I try to assume people are doing their best, but this was just awful. I will never fly with them again.",-1

The check in agent notified me that there was a $30 fee per bag, no big deal, I said “you’ve got to be kidding me!”. Apparently, he thought I said something else and immediately got in my face, yelling, screaming, threatening etc.. Then proceeded to tell me my credit card, which I used 10 minutes prior, was bad, obviously trying to jerk me around and embarrass me in front of everyone else in line. I am a business manager, if one of my employees treated a customer in such a disrespectful manner, they would be fired on the spot! I will never use Hawaiian again nor recommend them to anyone! I do hope that management from Hawaiian Airlines makes necessary changes so that others do not have such a horrible experience. They are totally unprofessional and arrogant with the way they treat their paying customers!",-1
2021-09-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Honolulu,,,,,,,1,worst customer service ever,True,"  My family and I were going to Honolulu in November. I purchased 5 tickets costing $1870 in August and tried to get a refund in September, 40 days before our flights were scheduled for. Hawaiian Airlines said they canceled the flights but the money would be credited to my account and needs to be used with the next year or forfeit your money. If that isn't the textbook definition of extortion then I don't know what is. All their tickets are non-refundable. You need to purchase a 3rd party insurance to protect your travel which I have. But why should I use the insurance when I didn't use the Airlines services. My hotel and rental car refunds were returned in one day. The customer agent lied to me and said when you purchase the tickets it says refundable or nonrefundable which it doesn't add she called me a liar. The worst customer service ever. I've written numerous complaints to Hawaiian Airlines all with returns saying they will not refund my money.",-1

Flew first class both times and I will say the flight attendants and service were wonderful both times. The check-ins not so good! Both airports we ran into extremely rude check-in clerks. At Ontario’s check-in we had a male clerk that was extremely rude. He wouldn’t even look at our paperwork showing we’d been vaccinated and tested negative for COVID-19. Wasn’t about to help us and told us we’d have to get out of line to download our results even though one of our results had been downloaded. Isn’t his job to help? On the way back at Honolulu airport the clerk looked at us like she had doubts we were in first class even after showing her our boarding passes. Had the nerve to asked us twice and looked down her nose at us. I’m not sure what the problem is with their customer service, but they definitely need to work on it. I’ve worked with the public for over 45 years and know this is not how you treat your customers. Very disappointed with the treatment we received from them at their check-in counters.",1

Governments new mandate 8/21. Hawaiian said due to Covid cancellations they will hold your ticket for your next trip. What they don’t tell you, is that they only waive the change fee, and you have to rebook within one year of your original booking date. In my case that was March 1, 2021. (With our timeshare we are only allowed to book 1 year in advance) Also, they will collect any additional fees if there is a change in your ticket cost. No accommodating for Covid/Government hotel/timeshares etc shut downs for restrictions. Do not book on this airline. I’m now out $500.",-1
2021-08-12,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Oakland,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3,how bad this experience was,True,"  We arrived at the airport in Maui 4 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart to Oakland. It looked like they decided to have every flight for the day leaving all within a 2 hour window due to the extreme amount of people trying to check in. It took over 1 hour just to have 1 bag scanned through to check for fruit / agricultural items. Then we sat in line for 2 hours just to check in one bag. This line moved at a snails pace and only had 2 employees checking baggage in. I have never seen such a slow process in my life. It literally took around 10 minutes per person. There was no sense of urgency from any of the staff at any time. The lines grew so large that they stacked up down the street. I have 3 small children who had to stand in the heat the whole time.. Then we had to stand in another line to go through security. There must have been 500 people wrapped around the building. I had to beg another family to let us cut in line because our flight was about to leave and would have had to stand in line for at least another 3 hours. We somehow made it 5 minutes before boarding. The worst part of the day was the male flight attendant (Dark spiked hair, glasses, approximately 35-40). He must have been having a bad day because his customer service was terrible. He was rude, grumpy, pushy, conttoling, and had a poor attitude. He constantly baggered people about wearing their masks even though this was during the time they kept serving food and drinks. What are we supposed to do? Cut a hole in the mask for a straw? Overall just not the kind of person I would expect to be a flight attendant. I could tell that the other female staff members did not like working with him. Doesn't seem like someone that should be working in customer service. The flight from Oakland to Maui was wonderful. I work in customer service and depend financially on receiving good surveys. This is actually the first time I have written a negative review on anything online in my entire life, I never complain unless in person. So that should tell you how bad this experience was.",-1
2021-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,procedure to again deplane us,True,"  Our 2 year old baby was required to wear a mark during the boarding of our flight from Honolulu to Boston. We, the parents, fully cooperated with the personal by putting on his mask, but he refused to use the mask because he was hungry and drinking his bottle in this moment. We made clear to the staff that he will be wearing his mark as soon as his finish his bottle but even though we were asked to deplane and stay in Honolulu at our own expenses. Our flight was rebooked to the next day. During the check-in and boarding time, we were given a special treatment by not only being allowed to do online check-in but also by being closely checked by the staff if our son was wearing the mask. As the feeding time of our son mashed with the boarding time, we faced a same situation as the day before. Our son woke up asking for his baby bottle. We gave the bottle already sat in the airplane. It resulted in a clear procedure to again deplane us (as we were threated).",-1

We arrived at the airport at 12pm for our 2pm flight out of OGG. Check-in had already been done the day before on the HA app and we also paid $30 for a checked bag. The situation at the airport was complete chaos. Huge lines apparently just for bag drop off. Self check-in kiosks were not working properly and not printing out bag tags. We ended up having to wait on one of those lines. But before that (and several times more during our wait) we talked with someone from the HA staff and explained our situation: I have a heart condition and need to be medicated every day. Losing our flight (even though we arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance) could have drastic consequences. The staff person guaranteed us that we would board the plane and that the flight would wait for us if needed. Again, we were guaranteed multiple times that the flight would not depart without us. At 1.50pm we finally reached one of the bag drop off desks… but the HA assistant suddenly left the desk and said she couldn’t help us. No one apparently was available to help us so we waited a few minutes until finally we went to another line and asked to be helped - it was 1.55pm. When we were about to check our bag (which had been already paid for) the new HA assistant told us that the boarding for our flight was already closed and we couldn’t board. I explained my health condition and what we had been told before by other HA staff - that the plane would wait for late passengers due to the chaotic situation at the airport. Unfortunately, the HA people were still not able to let us board our flight and, even worse, were not interested at all in offering any kind of alternative to help us go to San Jose (or San Francisco) on the same day. Finally a ""manager"" came to help us but, of course, she was also completely useless. Her excuse was that all passengers are advised to arrive 3 hours before their flight, for a domestic flight! She said everyone received an email with this notification. Obviously, we didn't get anything remotely similar to it. At the end, she apparently was got tired of dealing with an upset customer and decided to ask for security to get us removed. Right. We ended up having to buy three new tickets on United Airlines for that night - in other words, we paid an $1k+ more, waited in OGG for 7 hours and arrived home one day after. I lost one cycle of my medication - hopefully there won’t be other serious consequences. The lack of concern, ridiculous handling of bag drops at the airport and total misinformation by the HA staff are all reasons for our disappointment. Because of HA, we had to buy three new tickets on a different airline.",-1

After boarding we were informed that there was a problem with engine. Spent 2 hours inside the plane and were deboarded. Right after that it was announcement about 14,5 hours delay! Finally around midnight we took off. The flight attendants and gate agents were very rude. It was very cold inside the plane. I was lucky to get a blanket, but my husband was not. When he asked for the blanket, the flight attendant offered him to purchase, no free blanket any more! It was 11 hours of torture, literally. The food was not edible. I am not a picky eater, but what they served was not a food, it was a garbage. The worst airline I've ever flown on. Never again.",-1

I called in and was told that a change had been made to my flight, that there was no alternative flight I could be booked on and my only option was a refund. I wondered ""where was the call when you changed the flight?"" If I hadn't called in I could have shown up in LA with no flight to Hawaii. And there was no “we're sorry for the inconvenience please enjoy______” (fill in the blank - maybe some free air miles or something? I've been a Hawaiian air miles member for over 10 years). The impression the customer service rep gave me was that she was just waiting for me to accept the refund so she could say her rehearsed ""I do really apologize is there anything else I can assist you with?"" line. The refund takes 7-10 business days so I couldn't even use my money to book a replacement ticket with another airline. Super disappointing.",-1
2021-06-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,should have never booked with them,False,  I have to change my flight dates because of a situation at work. No compassion or understanding or willing to work with their customers. Which I think they should appreciate given that the pandemic happened and airlines are hurting. I said I was willing to pay the difference to change the dates and all they want to do is say no and not work with someone in a tough situation. Even tried to upgrade. This is whole thing ridiculous and I should have never booked with them. They are forcing someone to spend more money to because they are greedy for not being able to make money last year.

First, already annoyed that they couldn't just divert to LAX, which was an hour away, opposed to HNL, 2.5 hours flying back. When we arrive back in HNL, we're told to deboard so the passenger can be cared for and the plane can be refueled/cleaned. We were given an estimate of an hour. Well it is now 2 hours and we should have already re-departed. Now there has been an ""incident on the jet bridge"" and we are still waiting to board. So in my opinion a re-route back to our original destination, a 7 hour delay, rude and grumpy flight attendants and gate agents, and no compensation or meal vouchers offered, are all valid reasons qualifying for a 1-Star review and I will never fly with them for future trips.",-1

This airline, who market themselves as selling the warmth of the Hawaiian Islands is actually a heartless, cut throat business which in practice can care less about their customers. They literally lie about their benefits (such as being able to upgrade on line if seats are available in first class within 24 of your flight). Once I was flying and an engine caught fire. We had to make an emergency landing and stay in Maui for hours. Hawaiian issued $50.00 credits to the passengers on board. When I tried to use it the credit it was denied.

Then it was cold, but guess what. They had no blankets! Come on now really?! Since when did Hawaiian start lacking this much? They finally served a sandwich for the 5.5 hour flight. A sandwich with lettuce, tomato and no meat. They need to go back to the days when they actually tried. Because this was not the best experience for my wife and I.",-1

Perhaps Covid was part of the problem, but the cabin crew was not concerned with the passengers. Seemed almost irritated that we were there. We had pre ordered a special meal. No explanation and no special meal, either. Maybe things will change after COVID, but right now we would not fly Hawaiian again.",-1
2021-04-24,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Lihue,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,3,disgusting food served,False,"  I have flown Hawaiian Air a number of times over the years and considered them top notch in all categories. My recent flight was different. I still admire Hawaiian’s efficiency and courtesy, but the food is a different story. I realize the COVID-19 era is challenging, but there is no excuse for the utterly disgusting food served. On the flight to Honolulu from Los Angeles, the meal was a warmed sandwich: a huge grinder bun with some cheese slopped on it and a sun dried piece of tomato. It was inedible. On the flight home, they served what was called a chicken sandwich. It was another bun with bits of chicken in a sauce of some kind. My husband, who will eat anything, took one bite and declared it “nasty,” I looked at what was inside and threw it away. There has to be some acceptable alternatives. Try harder!",1

Due to covid we were unable to travel and had to cancel our flight. When contacting the third party, they said I should cancel the flights through Hawaiian Airlines. We called Hawaiian Airlines, who said we couldn't be refunded, but offered vouchers for a later trip. I accepted the vouchers. When I called Hawaiian Airlines to rebook the flights, they said that 3 of the 4 vouchers had been refunded. I received no refund. When I asked who authorized the refund they would not tell me. When I asked why they would give me vouchers and then cancel them, they refused to answer. When I asked why only 3 of the 4 were ""refunded"" they also refused to answer. They simply refused to honor 3 of the 4 vouchers totaling $1321.85. Don't fly with them, they will steal your money.",-1
2021-03-10,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Maui,,,,,,,2,now been changed to a connecting flight,False,"  My original flight was a direct flight from Las Vegas to Maui, my flight has now been changed to a connecting flight in HNL without my choice. When I originally purchased the direct flight, it did cost more than the connecting flights that I am now on. I was willing to pay more for a direct flight due to obvious convenience and an earlier arrival time. I strongly believed that I should have been compensated for the following inconveniences: 1. The connecting flights are cheaper, and just on principle, we should receive the difference. 2. My experience dealing with the above changes: a. I get the change email, I try to contact via text, wait 2 hours for someone to text me back, once they do, I ask my questions, with hardly any answers, other than “due to current demands the direct flight is gone till May.” b. Due to the lack of help via text I decided it would be better to call someone. I waited on hold for another 75 minutes. I got someone nice enough to answer my questions and send me to this form. I filled out the form once, it did not send and erased what I originally put in this box plus a ticket number that I now have forgotten and cannot look up due to my flight change. c. All this just to find out that you choose my flight for me and even if I did have a choice, and I found something cheaper, such as the day before or after, you wouldn't automatically refund the difference!? 3. Inconvenience the actual flight change inflicts upon us. a. The original flight got us to Maui at 9:30 AM, new flight arrival is 3:30 PM, which takes away 6 hours of our vacation. b. The rental car that has already been booked now needs to be changed and may incur a fee. c. An early check-in at our hotel that we paid extra for, which we will not be refunded for. d. The added stress of finding a connected flight Customer service did nothing when I reached out to them about this, I also cc'd the CEO and he had no response as well.",-1
2021-02-20,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Maui,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,it is terrible customer service,False,"  Hawaiian Airlines changed our flight during COVID to have a connection and doubled our total travel time. We intentionally booked with them to avoid connections (we're trying to limit our time in airports to not get COVID). They had an alternative direct flight on the same day that departed from a nearby airport. We called to ask to be switched to this flight, they said if we made that switch we would have to pay a $400 switching fee per person! I spent an hour on the phone with them, and they said that it was within their rights to switch the route on us. Though technically this might be true, it is terrible customer service to refuse an option that would avoid connections as we originally booked (and actually would be better for public health). Really terrible experience - I would recommend that they reconsider their customer service during COVID.",-1

Like drive to the store, go shopping and then is unable to find the car afterwards lost. So we called Hawaiian airlines to request assistance when he had to find his way through PDX to return to Honolulu. The agent on-line said to ask for a gate pass and then we would be able to accompany him to his gate. When we got to PDX and requested a gate pass we were informed that they were only available to military and children. So a supervisor was called. Mimi was wonderful. She was understanding and offered to escort him to the gate herself after he passed through security. All was well and he was able to get to the gate safely. Big shout out to Mimi at Portland airport. She was the essence of excellent customer service.",1

This is a review of the airline policies - booked future travel RT for 2 to NYC in May - everything cancelled due to pandemic. Greedy Hawaiian Airlines is refusing to refund and transfer miles back to mileage account. Offering vouchers good until 12/31/2020. Uncertain whether we can even travel before the end of the year. Swapping spring trip for a winter trip? We are very senior and have to plan our travel carefully - when we are able to travel. Hawaiian Airlines is using the pandemic to make a grab for our comparatively scarce resources because they (think) they can.,-1

Spent over 3 hours on the phone trying to navigate their travel waiver policy. Ended up having to pay fees that were supposed to be waived. Inflight entertainment was whack.

2020-02-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Sydney  via Honolulu,,,,,,,1,It’s a total ripoff,False,"  Maui to Sydney  via Honolulu. Asked for flight from Maui to Sydney on Hawaii Airlines. Booked me on HA (first leg) & Jetstar (second leg). Was led to believe had to fly Jetstar to Sydney ... found out today this is not true ... was lied to by somebody - could be that Flight Hub and/or HA makes more money by booking passengers on Jetstar. When found out there were HA flights to Sydney was told by Flight Hub that could only rebook on another Jetstar flight with still a day layover in Honolulu. To book both legs as HA makes existing tickets NON-refundable (ie, worthless). Have no choice but to rebook since Jetstar luggage restrictions are not medical condition friendly (have lots of bag weight due to medical stuff). Nobody stepped up to fix ... not Flight Hub ... not HA... not Jetstar. We worked our whole lives w/o any long vacations and now that we finally go on one we are sick to our stomachs and it hasn’t even started. Someone should have pointed this out or asked the right questions of us ... they are the travel experts - we are old but inexperienced in this travel stuff (lost about $1000 dollars so we’re not talking about a rebook or cancellation fee. It’s a total ripoff ... these companies should be avoided.",-1
2020-02-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Phoenix to Oahu,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,charges baggage fees each way,True,"  Phoenix to Oahu. Even if you buy a ticket that says you can change your flight, you will be charged the fare difference and a $200 fare fee. You try calling in and they charge you the fare fee of $200 pus an additional $25 fee plus the difference in the fare. When you ask them to accommodate you, they say it is above their scope. It is a simple change in their system to change the flight and they try to say that it is specific in the ticket upon purchase- it is not. This is my first time flying with them and it will be my last. My boss bought my ticket and it is the only reason I am on Hawaiian Airlines.  Hawaiian Airlines charges baggage fees each way - checked bag fees are $30 for the first bag each way (that is nuts) when Southwest you can fly to Hawaii and receive a free bag checked and change your flight without a fee, simply pay the difference of the fare. Lastly, even if I wanted to cancel my flight and I paid for the ticket that had the option to do so, I would only receive a travel credit and upon using that travel credit would be charged a $200 fee. Seriously amazed how this airline is still in business with all these rules. I am so disgusted they charge so many fees for no reason especially when there are so many airline options that people can choose from.",-1

Auckland to Honolulu. We are a family of three, my husband and I were travelling back home with our two year old, we checked in four hours before flight time, so you would think you would get good seats, or even sit together? They seat us in different seats (behind each other) but that is not the point, we are a family we don't have to request to sit together? there were three seats and four seats in the center isles and we could have sat there together, this was our worst flight ever, having to move a toddler back and forth between me and my husband was just terrible! I would not recommend, but if you do go as a family or even a couple double check that you will sit together! didn't think I had to do that",-1
2020-01-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Boston via Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,customer service was horrible,True,"  Sydney to Boston via Honolulu . The entire experience with Hawaiian Airlines was absolutely shocking. The seats we uncomfortable, the entertainment selection was low in comparison to what one would normally expect for long international flights, the ear buds provided didn't fit inside the socket properly which made it very difficult to listen to music or watch a movie without physically holding the cord in place. The aircon was freezing cold and dry, causing my nose to bleed through the flight and for at least 2 days following. When I asked the crew for another blanket because they weren't able to do anything about the temperature, I was told I could only use the one so the entire flight (all 4 flights that I had booked in fact for the one return trip) was miserable. I have never in my life had plane food that was as horrible as the food on Hawaiian and they had no options to give you. I didn't eat any of the food provided. With all of this in mind, it would have been nice to think that the staff may have been a little extra courteous to make up for the short comings of the company, but they seemed disinterested and almost too used to the complaints they were receiving to care any more. When we reached our halfway mark and had to transfer planes, there was next to no direction given on where we were meant to go or where to leave our luggage for the next flight. We ended up running to catch our next flight and were told to leave the luggage on a spot in the middle of the airport without any security whatsoever. After running and just making it to our next gate, we were told that the gate had moved so we, again, ran to the next gate so as not to miss the flight. After finally arriving the the appropriate gate, we found out that our flight had been delayed by several hours. I understand that delays happen, but the way it was handled and with the rest of the flight in mind, it was disappointing. To top it all off, when we finally arrived to our last destination, we were told that our luggage had, of course, been lost. They gave us provisions to pay for basic necessities but could not guarantee we would see our luggage again, which held all of our wedding clothes and decorations inside which, they let us know, would not be replaced if the luggage was not found. This was a horrible way to start what was a long awaited vacation and the start to our wedding. When we tried to speak with them at the end about all of the troubles, they were only willing to offer us a ticket to fly with them again for an amount that wouldn't get us anywhere, we would need to cover the rest of the cost of the ticket and didn't want to hear another word about it. The customer service was horrible along with everything about the flights that we had with them. It was the first and last time we will be booking with them. We are disgusted.",-1
2020-01-20,0.7,Family Leisure,First Class,Honolulu to Phoenix,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,3,cabin staff were amazing,True,"  Honolulu to Phoenix. I have flown Hawaiian severs times within the Islands and several times to the US mainland and this experience to Phoenix was consistent with those flights: amazing cabin crew and onboard food, with poor ground service and management choices that make Hawaiian not a premium airline which is unfortunate for the excellent cabin staff. When compared to southwest, Hawaiian charges for checked bags and even enforces a 50 dollar fee for business class to the mainland for baggage above 50 pounds when both American, Delta, and United check 70 pound baggage in business. The ground staff seemed angry at the passengers and were not helpful. However they did seem understaffed and had to deal with many passengers who were confused of where to go so this was probably more on management creating their poor service. The lounge was basic. On-board, the seats looked modern and sleek but lacked padding and were not very comfortable. Better than a recliner on a 737 to and from Hawaii but not as comfortable as united 777’s to Hawaii (although it does have the advantage of not sitting 4 in the middle like united a domestic 777). The cabin staff were amazing. They addressed every passenger by name and were fantastic. They also thanked each individual passenger for flying with them before landing. The food was very good. Average entertainment delivered through an IPad. Summary of what was good: great cabin crew and food. Average: the seats and entertainment. Poor: ground service and lounge. Hawaiian does not compete with LCCs to Hawaii and because of small things isn’t a premium airline like what they want to market themselves because of some management choices. Can’t call United, Delta, or American “premium” airlines either but are better because of small things in business class so long as you with the draw and get a good flight crew with them.",1

I had only one reference number for the tickets. I’m planning to stay in the airport overnight as I had a long layover. Weeks prior to my flights I talked and emailed the customer service in their website. I asked them where I will claim my 2 checked in baggage. They all said in my final destination which is NZ. To my surprise they check out my bags in Honolulu and I can’t come back inside the airport coz they said my flight is on the next day. I almost didn’t have place to stay that night carrying my suitcases because hotels cost a big amount and mostly fully booked. Most of their employees I encountered were rude, arrogant and unprofessional. They even told me that their customer service doesn’t use emails. I told them I have communication thru email from their website and I called them for confirmation. One more thing, my flight was not comfortable. The plane is to cold. You need to buy a $10 blanket.

I've flown Hawaiian Airlines twice, once each domestically and internationally. Never again, if I can help it. The queue times at the gate aren't particularly long, as the flights are boarded efficiently. The meals are fine, in my experience. The entertainment options have some interesting public interest sort of programs about Hawaiian life and culture. But the staff, whether at check-in, the gate or on the plane, work efficiently, they're robotic. Meaning, they seem to exude the characteristics of aloofness and just being miserable. They're doing their jobs obligatorily, so obviously, and they just don't seem to enjoy serving customers. I don't have an explanation as to why, as they're shuttling passengers to and from paradise. Maybe Hawaiian doesn't treat their staff well?",-1
2020-01-01,0.6,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Sydney,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,3,the inflight service is very basic,True," Honolulu to Sydney with Hawaiian Airlines. We purchased seats in the quiet comfort row as I was travelling with my wife and 2 children aged 5 and 1 to ensure we had space to let them sleep and allowed for more leg room. Boarding was smooth and staff friendly. However the inflight service is very basic. The major problem is the inflight service. They serve a meal as you reach cruising altitude and then another just before landing. This leaves around 6 hours of no food or refreshments or something to break up the 10 hour flight. They do offer additional food to be bought which a lot of passengers were taking up due to the time gaps between meals. This was a day flight so not alot of people were sleeping. The staff occasionally walk around to offer water but it was up to individuals to be proactive if they wanted anything more. Given the time between meals, it would be good to see them bring drink options through the aisles as the attendants mainly were sitting around chatting (at least I perceived this). When you compare to other airlines, it just appears unprofessional. The staff were pleasant and friendly but it was just the level of service I would say is sub par. Meals were very ordinary and there is no choice of meal either so be prepared to eat whatever they have, ie no vegetarian or kids meals etc. The big appeal was baggage limit i.e 2 X 32kg checked luggage and the extra comfort, you really do get extra leg room. They provided an amenity kit but I didn't have.much use for it. Inflight entertainment was ok but not a large depth of films/shows considering its 10 hrs there and 10 hrs back.",1
2020-01-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Kona,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,a terrible experience,True," San Francisco to Kona. We planned a Hawaiian trip a couple of weeks before the Christmas holidays. We booked Hawaiian Airlines through a third party website, paying a premium price for the tickets as a result. We did not realize that it was main cabin basic - which the cheapest class on the fare list. We had a terrible experience with the onward and the return journey. It seems that the airline has no regard for customers that have this class of tickets. They treat them as if they are doing them a favor and are very rude. They treat you as a zone 6 - which is the last to board. During our onward journey, they told us that we cannot carry our cabin bags as the flight was full. We were ok to check-in all of the cabin bags except one as it had costly camera equipment. The ‘agent’ as they call them was so arrogant that she told that she would re-book us on another flight if we were not ready to check-in that bag too. I then asked what if the equipment gets damaged, she was haughty and said we could claim it later! I am astonished by the disregard she had for customers. We had an equally bad experience on our return journey too. The airline does not allow you to choose seats during check-in because of the class. I had injured my leg and needed assistance, so we called in the customer service to request them to seat us together. They told us that they would service the request at the gate. At the gate, the agent again said he would process our request when it comes, and it was placed last (mostly because of the fare class). He then said that by the time he got to the request, all the seats were taken and could give both aisle seats. Once we boarded, another agent came and made us change our seats, seating us far apart in spite of telling her my situation. She also was haughty and said to us that we were not assigned seats in the first place! We wished we had never flown this airline. The agents have an attitude towards so-called `cheap` ticket class - I wonder why do they even have it in the first place if they loathe them. I will never again fly with this airline.",-1

Most of their US based locations do not have a club lounge and when you arrive to Honolulu to transfer to another flight they do not honor your first class upgrade. Also, the boarding process is awful. You pay more but you board after about 25 to 50 people. So, save your money and do not book with Hawaiian Airlines! You get treated way better in other airlines.

I flew with premium economy seat from Auckland to Honolulu. (11 hour journey). The leg room and the seat was reasonably good. I was so shocked when I saw how small and tight the economy seats behind me were. (Seats and leg room are much smaller than usual.) Food was just a pack of cold sandwich and juice for the whole journey. Flight attendants basically disappeared in between food time. No conversation, not many smiles on their face, no interaction with passengers. They provided minimum customer service. During my return journey (back to Auckland). I was not feeling well and had a temperature. I decided to upgrade myself to First Class so I could lay down and have some rest. The upgrading process was done over the counter at the airport. Staff: no smiles but got it done very quickly. Returning flight: Seat was able to fully decline to a flatbed. The service was so different from those premium economy or economy. Flight attendants made conversation with those first class passengers with a smile. What a surprise! Food is average but of course it is considered to be much better than the cold sandwich and packed juice. I fedback to the flight attendant that my blanket smelt awful and requested to change to another one. It smelt like it hadn't been washed for at least more than a month. She replied me saying that there was no spare blanket around, so she couldn't do anything. Giving me that kind of ""Take it or leave it"" attitude and just walked away. I was so disappointed. They called it ""First Class cabin"". I was feeling so cold the whole journey. Bear in mind that I was not feeling well and this experience was really poor. Yes, I agreed that the cost of their airtickets are slightly cheaper than other airlines but I would not fly with them anymore. I rather pay a bit more to get at least reasonable service.",-1

The flight left on schedule and the flight was same as the one we had from Honolulu to New York few days prior. One thing I did notice was that they first went through the the drink and food cart to sell them. Then, they went through the second time providing the meal with complementary alcoholic beverages and drinks. I got little confused at first on the first run of the of the food cart with the accompanying announcement thinking I had to purchase the drinks and food until the the meal cart came through. Probably a marketing ploy to get passengers to buy. Anyway, given that US domestic services offered by all airlines including the big three operate on budget airline model of charging for everything, it is to be expected if you live in the States. Other than that, for other aspects of the flight my previous comments stand.",1

First time flying on Hawaiian Airlines after more than 20 years of not flying with them. Flight leg from Sydney to Honolulu was full. Unique part of the airline is the Hawaiian culture it promoted in the background music, style of food offered during the flight, and the flight attendant uniform. Having lived in Honolulu during my early 20's with many local friends, it does bring back memories. However, staying on the subject at hand, the seats were average quality, food was better than average for the most part, alcoholic beverage was free, and the service was as expected of an average carrier. One negative is the time between serving and picking up the tray is too short. If they have another 10-15 minutes that would have been comfortable time given for a meal. The one big disappointment was the IFE. The selection was limited and you could not play until after the plane had taken off and the IFE was stopped about 30 minutes before landing. They could learn from carriers like Air NZ, Emirates, Qantas, and Virgin Australia and update their system to play IFE from the moment the passengers board to disembark when they land. After all, they are competing with some of these carriers from Australia to US. As we were transferring to another A330 in Honolulu to New York, the baggage transfer information was provided on the plane and it was easy to locate the counter after the Customs. We left Honolulu on time and the flight to New York was pretty much a repeat of our journey from Sydney to Honolulu.",1
2019-09-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,Las Vegas to Kona via Honolulu,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,fly another airline if you can,True,"  Las Vegas to Kona via Honolulu. My wife is terminally ill. In May 2019, I purchased two first class round trip tickets from Kona Hawaii to JFK NYC for medical treatment. I paid $8800 for these two tickets. I had to cancel for emergency medical reasons. I was issued a voucher for the $8800. In July, I attempted to use the voucher to buy tickets for the same route. The online price was $8800 but they wouldn’t accept the voucher. I had to call customer service. I was told that the same tickets that I was looking at online would cost me $17,000 because I was using a voucher. I decided to go to Las Vegas on Hawaiian and then on to NYC on their partner airline, Jet Blue. They told me that I couldn’t use the voucher to travel with Jet Blue. I asked for two first class tickets r/t from Kona to Vegas and back. The cost for these two tickets was $3400. Hawaiian told that I could only use the voucher once and that they would be keeping the remaining $5400. When I asked why, I was rudely told to “go read your contract”! The trip from Kona to Vegas was mediocre, the food on the menu some foreign unpronounceable dish. I asked for bread and butter but they didn’t have any. The return trip from Vegas to Kona was horrible. I arrived at the airport an hour before takeoff, at 08:30. Hawaiian told the rental car shuttle bus driver that they didn’t have any wheelchair available. I went into the terminal and there must have been 10 wheelchairs at the Hawaiian check in kiosk. After getting my wife in the terminal, when I went to check in, at 08:45. I was told that they had released my two tickets and the aircraft doors were already closed! I immediately said “it’s 45 minutes before takeoff” and the attendant replied “you are not going to make it through TSA” and “your luggage will never make it in time”. She checked us in and notified the boarding gate that we were on the way and that our tickets should be reinstated, it’s was now 08:50. The SAS personnel at McCarran Airport were outstanding. They rushed my wife in a wheelchair, through TSA, on the tram and around the terminal to the boarding gate. We got there at 09:05 and they had just started board the main cabin. The flight left on time but again the meal was some unpronounceable name. I asked for bread and butter and was offered a croissant. When we got to Honolulu, it was raining, This time Hawaiian provided a wheelchair but I had to push my wife through the terminals. The connecting flight was delayed for almost an hour and the boarding gate had been changed but no announcement was made. Upon arrival in Kona it was pouring rain. My wife was transported off the aircraft and I was asked if I would mind pushing her wheelchair through the rain to baggage claim. So if you are thinking of flying first class with Hawaiian, save yourself a lot of money and fly in the main cabin. As a matter of fact, fly another airline if you can. The service is the same but the tickets are a little cheaper. As for me, I will never fly on Hawaiian Airlines again.",-1

First time on Hawaiians new narrow body aircraft across the Pacific. I had a very positive experience. Very comfortable seating (far better then Delta or American or United on similar aircraft). The service was excellent and the food was actually delicious. Had a great staff and experienced aloha from start to finish which isn’t always the case. I will definitely take this flight again. Only complaint, Hawaiian stubbornly refuses to install Wi-Fi. That's just stupid.",1

Soon there will be an alternative to flying Hawaiian out of Sacramento to Honolulu nonstop - Southwest will start in January and I will never fly Hawaiian again. Why do I detest Hawaiian so much? Because of their high prices, outdated and unreliable planes (frequent mechanical problems), packed seating, terrible entertainment (only option is their horrible Hawaiian music videos, which never vary noticeably), shameless hawking of their credit card to a captive audience, self-congratulatory preening because they serve a (terrible) ""meal"" in coach, and to cap it all off, undeviating penalties that hammer you whenever you need to alter a reservation.",-1
2019-08-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Maui to Sydney via Honolulu,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,flight attendants did not interact with the passengers,True," Maui to Sydney via Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines. This 12.50 pm flight left Honolulu on time. Once we were in the air we were instructed to close all the window blinds and the meal was served immediately. The flight attendants then turned out the lights and disappeared for the remainder of the flight. (In the main cabin, in any case, perhaps the experience in business class was different.) They have a lounge built into the middle of the plane, and they spent the entire flight taking turns slipping in and out of it while ignoring the passengers. Meanwhile, we spent the entire 11-hour, daytime flight in the dark, with window blinds down and all the lights turned out. I felt like the intention was to make it feel like night time so everyone would sleep and not be a bother. Other than breezing down the aisle with a water bottle a couple of times, the flight attendants did not interact with the passengers in the main cabin until they came around with the second-service sandwiches - one hour before landing. Seven and a half hours into the flight I caught up with one of the attendants as he was unlocking the lounge for his turn inside, and asked him about food. Without looking at me he said he didn't know what time it was but the food was usually served 1.5 to 2 hours before landing. He then turned his back and slipped into the lounge, locking the door behind him. An hour and a half before landing there was some activity in the galley but still no food. By this time it had been 8 hours since the meal, with nothing offered in between but water. I went back and asked if we were going to be getting our sandwiches and I was cheerfully told it was coming. Half an hour later - one hour before landing on an 11-hour flight - they passed out sandwiches, then started through with the drink cart. The automated overhead message saying food service was ending due to proximity of landing came on while they were doing this. So, basically, for an 11-hour daytime flight the flight attendants served the meal immediately, turned out all the lights and disappeared until one hour before landing. They spent the entire flight taking turns in their private lounge and otherwise staying completely out of sight, then reappeared for the second meal service as we were about to land. I know the flight attendants are there primarily for safety and the customer service part of it may seem, to them, secondary. But for passengers, whether a long flight is bearable or unbearable rests largely on the quality of the crew. I felt in this case they planned the flight for their own convenience and comfort and didn't care about their passengers even a little. I would never book a long flight on Hawaiian again, and I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

Everyone was very nice. Until we encounter a rude flight attendant. I called for her attention very politely. She, on the other hand, was annoyed by me even calling her over. My question was how many carbohydrates were in the complimentary breakfast. As a type 1 diabetic is very important for me to know. Well, she was extremely rude, no intention to even try to figure out how many carbs the breakfast had. Again the entire time she seem annoyed. But later we saw her being completely different with the family in front of us. She was nice, talkative and polite. I am extremely upset that the do not provide the nutritional facts for food which legally they should.",-1

Boarding was not chaotic anymore. As usual FA were helpful and smiling. Maybe Southwest Airlines completion on this monopoly market is resulting in a positive effect.",1
2019-07-30,0.7,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Honolulu,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,3,we got to board early,False,"  My mother and I flew from San Francisco to Honolulu in the Extra Comfort Seating. We got to the airport early and dropped off our luggage. Staff at the check-in counter made it easy to check us in and give us our boarding passes. The boarding started on time and we got to board early thanks to our extra comfort seating. The plane was OLD. The IFE was very unresponsive and there were no personal air vents. We took off perfectly on time. After takeoff, the cabin crew came around with various items for purchase, such as snacks, earphones, and blankets. The IFE selection was small but had some new movies. The cabin crew came came around with complimentary drinks and a free meal, one of the big positives of Hawaiian Airlines. I ordered and POG (Passion Orange Guava) juice and was given a sandwich with mushroom and mayo on white bread, which tasted pretty good. I thought the meal/drink service was finished for the time being but then the same cabin crew came back and offered me the can of POG juice. The cabin crew often came around with water. As the flight ended, another drink service commenced and cabin crew handed out customs cards for Hawaii and offered everyone free maps of the island of Oahu. After landing, it took a while to find our luggage out of the baggage claim, but we eventually found out and were on our way to Waikiki beach.",1
2019-07-25,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Honolulu to Phoenix,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,you'll get nothing and like it,True,"  Honolulu to Phoenix. Given the competition, I am surprised people even fly Hawaiian. Premium economy gets you 2 things, a seat with a few more inches and boarding just one zone earlier.  Even United (historically the worst) gives you free drinks in that class. The A330 has no passenger controlled air vents and the smallest overhead luggage bins on a widebody I have ever seen. The crews on Hawaiian definitely lived up to the island credo of ""no worries"", which translated into, you'll get nothing and like it. Food, drinks, information, etc.  I have not seen that level of unprofessionalism on a flight since the last time I flew United many years ago. Hopefully now that Southwest is coming to the island, they will figure it out.",-1
2019-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Honolulu,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2,Hawaiian Airlines is not up to it,True,"  My family and I were booked on the July 14 2019 flight New York to Honolulu which was scheduled to depart at 10 AM. The cabin crew had arrived on the HNL-JFK flight 26 hours earlier. There was a blackout in Manhattan on the evening prior, although power was fully restored by midnight. This had supposedly affected the ability of some of these personnel to get sufficient sleep. Nevertheless, they all turned up to work on the morning of 14 July. However, at about 9am, the pilots decided they had had insufficient sleep. HA found some replacement pilots by about 11 am. However, at that point, the cabin crew decided that they had also had insufficient rest hours. They wandered off for their 10 hours rest, which commenced when they reached the hotel, around midday. The rest of us were pretty much stuck at JFK for the duration. So we had some time to look around, including wandering over to terminal 4 to look at alternatives (Delta, it didn't work, but that's a whole other story). For what it's worth, and I looked extensively at the airport and online, I am not aware of another flight leaving JFK that day that was delayed due to the impact of the blackout on crew. The HA JFK ground personnel, who all had to pull a ~19 hour shift (and were great) handed out lunch and dinner vouchers and then $300 discount vouchers for future flights. Arriving back at the terminal around 11 pm, it seemed likely from the shopping bags they brought that at least some of the members of the cabin crew had spent some of their additional 10 hours in Manhattan productively... The flight departed after 1 am on Monday 15 July, more than 15 hours late. They then set up the crew sleeping quarters in 45-46 C-G, and left the fasten belts sign illuminated for most of the flight. We arrived in HNL at 5 am local time with the crew gregarious and friendly and the passengers weary. I personally had by that time been awake for 30 hours and had to stay up all day to get back on time. A family we met on the flight advised that the same thing had happened to them on a BNE-HNL flight - they were actually flying on the vouchers they received that time. Issues for HA to consider: 1. How is it possible that even with a blackout, your cabin crew did not have the opportunity to get 10 hours rest in the preceding 24 hours? Do you not have early check in arrangements with Manhattan hotels? Why are other airlines able to handle the impact of a 5 hr blackout on crew? 2. If your crew aren't going to play ball, or the flight isn't leaving for any reason, please advise your customers as early as possible. 3. Your passengers are mostly heading out on vacation. Surely it would cost HA a lot less to pay your cabin crew a ""hardship bonus"" or overtime rather than absorb the cost and PR impact of stealing a day of vacation from 250 passengers, for something less than a pretty good reason? 4. HA and its personnel appear to have an attitude well suited to island hopping, but not well adapted to the rigors and challenges of long haul operations. So HA should stick to island hopping. Under no circumstances would I ever again use Hawaiian Airlines for anything else. It is a fact of life that flights can be delayed. Reasons can include weather, emergencies of various kinds, mechanical issues, etc. The mission for long haul operators is to get aircraft in the air despite the challenges. Hawaiian Airlines is not up to it.",-1

No WiFi, only beef option for breakfast going. Returning again no WiFi. We did not get offered water although some passengers did. Had to ask for a soda.

2019-05-20,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Honolulu,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2,difficulties on the return flight,True," Portland to Honolulu. The flight to HNL was without any hiccups. The flights were on time and the staff was friendly. My difficulties came on the return flight. I had made a separate reservation for my Dad and his dog to fly on the same flight I was booked on, with a stop in Maui. I called reservations to attach the dog to the ticket because we were going to put in on as luggage. I spent an hour on the phone trying to get this complete. The staff on the phone made no indication that a stop in Maui would be any sort of problem. Upon checking in at HNL, it went as smooth as I could have expected. The staff checking us in inquired with someone about what notes needed to be made in order to ensure safe delivery for my Dads pet with the stop in Maui. She was satisfied with the answer, so she sent us along. In Maui, I received a phone call indicating that the plane to Portland could not support the pet, so I'd have to go back to HNL, where I just came from! Because the dog was being handled so much he was getting too anxious, thus we needed to come down to meet him. This was after a gate attendant tried to get us on a flight back to HNL. She was kind enough to offer a food voucher (which I could not use because I spent all of our time in the security line). We settled the dog, waited in the security line, for the second time that day and made the flight just in time. What a waste of time and communication. My Dad with breathing and walking difficulties was being taken from one side of the airport to another, a lot more walking than he anticipated, along with the stress he's feeling in regard to his dog. Back to HNL we go and make it in time for the direct flight to Portland. I was not offered any kind of compensation, acknowledgement of the mistake nor did I feel that anyone cared about the distress this caused during this whole fiasco. I had paid for Extra Comfort seats and for the two different people in Maui was trying to do the rebooking, they did not notice this until I pointed it out, twice. So, had I not mentioned it, there was a possibility that I would have got economy seats and I would have lost that added expense. I could not lose my cool because I didn't want my Dad to stress more. I have never encountered such an experience. I felt like this was something I should have known ahead of time rather than an oversight on the airline's part, not once, but twice. With the rising cost of their airline tickets and all the 'for purchase' items, it's becoming harder and harder to make the trip back to visit the family that I do have left there. The crew on the aeroplane was friendly and checked in often. I have flown a pet before and this horrific visit was a far cry from my first. I was relocating my Dad and this day actually made him question the decision, saying, maybe this wasn't a good idea. I kept my cool and did my best not to show my frustration.",1

We are from the UK and this was our first time using Hawaiian Airlines  and we were very disappointed. We paid 80 Dollars each to upgrade to Premium Seats and although the interior of the plane was light and airy and clean, we thought the service was shocking. The temperature was so cold everyone was putting on sweaters and jackets. When we mentioned how cold it was to the cabin crew they offered us a blanket for 10 Dollars each. We think this was a deliberate ploy in order to sell blankets. No meal was provided just light snacks, fair enough, and we were offered complimentary drinks, my daughter and I both requested Diet Coke and were given one can between us and asked to share it - unbelievable penny pinching. We would never use this airline again",-1
2019-04-30,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Auckland,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,3,cabin staff marginally more friendly,False,"  Honolulu to Auckland. Return leg following previous review of outbound leg. This was an improvement on the outward journey. Cabin etc fairly identical though a newer aircraft. Food was better and cabin staff marginally more friendly. IFE was ok and departure/arrival times were as predicted. Beware the 10 min delay to be gassed with insecticide at AKL airport - this appears to becoming a more frequent addendum to the experience and I would stress, this is nothing to do with Hawaiian Airlines - though they could have advised us there would be a delay after landing.",1
2019-04-28,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Honolulu,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,2,negative thing is inflight food,True,"  Sydney to Honolulu. Hawaiian Airlines A330 was spacious and new aircraft. Seating configuration was 2-4-2 in economy class. Boarding was swift and was before time, we push-backed before the departure time of 9.40pm. Aircraft was clean, spacious and cabin crew was smiling in Hawaiian style. I liked that the flight captain instructed the passengers to keep the window shades down to keep in mind that the other passengers would be sleeping. Generous baggage allowance of 32kgs per checked bag and 2 bags were allowed per person. Both the sectors’ flights departed and arrived before time and the baggage was loaded on the carousel swiftly at Sydney while arriving back into Australia. Check-in staff at Honolulu airport was very helpful. We only carried 23 kgs per bag (had 4 bags each) as the ticket was on Virgin Australia, however the staff said we can carry 32kgs per bag (total 4 bags). Even without requesting, he inserted “interline transfer” tags on all our 4 checked bags and due to this, our bags were the first ones to arrive in Sydney. This erased my worry of time delays as we only had 2hrs and 20 mins at Sydney before our connecting flight to Melbourne. The only negative thing is about inflight food on both Hawaiian Airlines flights. On departing from Sydney, we were given a small snack pack consisting of less than one sandwich, a non-edible chocolate cake piece and few cut fruits. Morning breakfast tray was very small and was equally bad. On the return flight to Sydney, afternoon lunch was boiled noodles with few veges, cut fruits and grated cabbage in vinegar. Just before arrival into Sydney, we were given a very tiny bag consisting of 1 small sandwich and small sized apple. I know that US airlines are not customer friendly, but on these medium to long-haul flights, food trays should be good. Food service was the only part which took down Hawaiian Airlines. Hopefully they improve on this, considering their flight tickets are expensive.",1

2019-04-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,First Class,Boston to Kauai via Honolulu,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,I would avoid Hawaiian Airlines,True,"  The new non stop Hawaiian Airlines route between Boston and Honolulu cost me more than $1,900. It started out at the boarding gate with about six employees looking everywhere but at their customers. Only one overwhelmed woman had a clue. It seemed that they were too busy training their other employees. Holding a first class ticket I expected that when it was time to board there would be an announcement . Nope. Instead they called that they were boarding anyone who needed special assistance. Ok. Like people who are elderly or in wheel chairs get to board first....this wasn't the case...They let about 25 kids and their parents board in coach first ..while I waited and waited. I'm sorry but 30 people sitting in coach should not take priority over your first class customers except if someone is actually handicapped. Bad start. After boarding I was offered a drink. The seat was nice although no one greeted me to tell me how the the seat worked. No one greeted me by my name. There are only a handful of first class passengers. Jet Blue Mint first class greets you as soon as you board..by your name and they take the time to show you how your seat works. (Jet Blue Mint cross country is as little as $499.) Next came the flight attendant who requested I order my food for the entire 12 hour flight including what I wanted to drink. Ok but I'm not sure at 9am what I want to drink 10 hours latter. I ordered the ""Veggie"" option. When the first meal arrived it was a soggy quiche, stale bready croissant, unripe boring melon and get this..a glass of red wine. She put the food down and disappeared. Next came the 13 inch iPad entertainment they passed out. They had a few good movies and I watched The Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody. I was hungry again after the poor quality breakfast and was informed that all they have is potatoes chips and the next meal won't be served until an hour before we arrive in Honolulu about ten hours later. But a flight attendant came thru first class selling box snacks. Really? $1900 dollars one way and they are selling me a snack because I'm still hungry? I passed. A little while latter I walked back to Premium Comfort and asked the flight attendant there (because the first class flight attendants had blocked off their station with a table of potato chips and disappeared for most of the flight) if I could possible get something to eat. Her cold response: ""You are in first class go up there."" OK so I go back and ask the flight attendant if I can have a snack box. She says ""I'm busy now changing over the flight deck, I'll just be a minute"". After listening to her and a male crew member laugh and talk for at least 15 minutes I determined that she completely forgot about me. I went up and asked again. She apologized and brought me a complimentary snack box that had a few chips and two bites of hummus in it. I was never offered anything to eat again until about 10 hours later when the main meal arrived. I looked across at the ""veggie"" meal that my fellow passenger was eating and thought oh boy that looks mushy and I think I ordered the wrong thing. Not to worry because when she brought my food she brought me the wrong meal and I was given a dry semi cold piece of chicken and stale bread with one piece of butter. No one ever came by and asked me if I wanted anything else. I would avoid Hawaiian Airlines in the future. Its only good for the seat. Service dialed in, food poor. First class? Not.",-1

This was my first trip to Hawaii on Hawaiian Airlines. The seats in economy class are really cramped. They just want to make money out of anything and everything. They asked for $10 for a simple blanket. Entertainment system sucks. They ask you to download their stupid entertainment app, which of course, worked only with in-flight wifi. And, lo, you have to buy packages if you want to watch anything. I have never had experience with any airlines so far that asks money for in-flight entertainment. The snacks they offer have no choice. If you ask them to replace the meat item with a veg then you will get a simple answer - this is all we have. C'mmon do you expect anyone that boards your flight, to eat meat? I am not going to fly this airline ever.",-1

They have monopoly on air travel here in Hawaii and they are behaving as such. Agents barely speak English,  and god forbid you need to make any changes to your reservations.

I used them to fly to South Korea and even their trans-oceanic flights are way below their competitors level in service and overall experience.",-1
2019-02-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Sacramento,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,responded by apologising profusely,False,"  Well, Hawaiian have now investigated their screw up for 2 weeks and responded by apologising profusely and given me a $400 e-Ticket with strings attached. That it takes 2 weeks to investigate an admitted huge and obvious screw-up of this magnitude, shows how little Hawaiian really cares for its customers. Having said that, they completely fail to appreciate why they screwed up. After 2 weeks, they think it was a training problem. It wasn’t. Their employees (all 4 of them including 2 supervisors) followed their policies and procedures, so training won’t change anything. The screw-up I experienced had nothing to do with training. It was entirely a management and cultural issue – Hawaiian’s staff were not and are not empowered to make the obvious right decision within a 2 hour period because they fear the consequences of acting without authority so much, that they very deliberately and knowingly to my face increased my inconvenience by some 10 hours. That Hawaiian Airlines considers a $400 eTicket credit to be adequate compensation for its 3 very substantial failings that resulted in such extraordinary frustration and massive inconvenience, highlights for me, and I'm sure most others, how little Hawaiian Airlines values its customers and how little it invests to seek to make amends for its staff’s very deliberate lack of care for its customers. If Hawaiian Airlines genuinely wanted to prevent a re-occurrence of this monumental screw-up, this matter would have been escalated to senior management, specifically the CEO, which is the only area of any organization where substantial management and cultural issues are able to be successfully addressed. But they didn’t; so they’ll continue to screw over many more customers.",-1

What a rip off and no benefits. No movies unless you get a app on your phone. If you want a pillow or blanket they want to charge you $10.

This is only my second time flying in this airline. First time the flight was delayed for 3.5 hours. The second time the flight was delayed for 45 minutes waiting on a crew member. They got us all on the aircraft before they let us know. Would've been nice to wait in the terminal instead of waiting in the cramped airline seats.,-1
2019-01-27,0.4,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to Honolulu,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3,Very disappointing service,True," At my travel agent's recommendation I flew Hawaiian Airlines (first trip to Hawaii) so my bags could be checked in all the way through on my return Big Island / Honololu / Sydney flight. Very disappointing service on Sydney - Honolulu flight, and almost as bad return. Grumpy cabin crew who did not seem to even want to be there, very limited meal selection, very hard to get attention or service. It was more like a 10-11 hour domestic flight than an international travel experience. Glad I bought the US$125 ""premium"" economy upgrade though. Inter-island Honolulu - Big Island and back were fine. I would not fly Hawaiian again and wish I'd flown Qantas.",-1
2019-01-26,0.6,Couple Leisure,First Class,Honolulu to Seoul,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,3,getting my suitcases last,True,"  Honolulu to Seoul. I have flown Hawaiian Airlines many times. As a Pualani Platinum member I was able to compare my experiences every flight. Customer Service wise, ground staff are average and flight staff varies (some flights were great, some very disappointing). I travel First Class most of the time. Seat comfort and space is just alright, food is average. My major complaint is the baggage service. What’s the point of having a priority tag on your suitcases being in First Class or Platinum Member if you will receive it last anyway since they will prioritize connecting passengers? This is mostly on flights landing in HNL and mainland US. Other airlines I have flown with, when I have priority tags on my suitcases and/or flying premium cabins, I get my suitcase as soon as I arrive the baggage carousel. With Hawaiian Airlines, since most passengers are connecting to different islands or somewhere else, I always end up getting my suitcases last or almost last! That is very frustrating since you disembark first and gets to the baggage carousel first and you will be left there when almost everybody have collected their baggage. I really do not see the point of them putting priority tags for First Class passengers if they are not connecting anywhere and get their bags last anyway. It happened every single time and it is just really frustrating! I mostly travel long haul and all I want is a fast way to get home after a long flight. But no, my suitcases will come after all the economy connecting passenger baggage! Sorry Hawaiian Airlines, but compare to Emirates and Korean Air that I traveled in First Class, their First Class service really feels like First Class on everything especially giving you priority on mostly everything! To me, priority means “PRIORITY”!",1

The flight over was what we expected, with comfortable seats, quality food, and good entertainment. The flight back, not so much! The airplane was downgraded to a smaller class, and we were given $300 vouchers at the gate for the 'inconvenience.' If you are ever in this situation, do not accept anything short of a full refund. The seat was broken; wouldn't recline without standing and pushing it back manually, and the leg rest did not work at all. The good was gross - there is just no other word for it. The flight attendants were not helpful in any way at all. The voucher can only be used for 12 months, is not transferable, and is a waste of paper. Do not get conned by this airline.",-1

I was travelling with a trolley of +/- 12 kg and allowed cabin size. When boarding a check in agent lifted my bag and said ""too heavy"". I asked for a weight check on a scale but she refused and literal when i say it is too heavy it is too heavy? You have two options to check it to Honolulu or Narita.  Totally unacceptable customer service and clearly an employee that does not have any competence in working with customers.",-1

I knew that the B717 was not a large aircraft and the flight was only 40 minutes long so I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and seats. The flight attendants were very fast if you asked for something and they were kind. The seat was pretty comfortable and there were only two seats on my side of the isle. I will definitely fly with them again.,1

The service this airline provides is so poor and slow. Starting with the customer service and pricing on my flight. My husband and myself both opened a Hawaiian airline credit card to take advantage of their 50,000 air miles promotion. I got my miles but my husband didn’t and when we called the customer service number the representative couldn’t give us an explanation as to what happened to his air miles. When we were in the airport the representative took approximately an hour to help two people in front of us. The experience we have had with this airline has been so stressful and unpleasant I’m planning on cancelling my credit card and never giving this airline my business again.",-1

My wife and I went on a vacation to Kauai by Hawaiian Airlines. The flight time to the island from Los Angeles is 5.5 hours. The overall experience was very good. On a scale of 1 to 10, I will rate it as 9. The scheduled departure time was 8:00 AM and it departed exactly at that time and arrived at Lihue Airport also on time. The aircraft was new and the cabin was quiet inside. The inside was clean. The cabin crew were very courteous and professional. The in-flight service was also good. On the way to Kauai, they gave a light breakfast and soft drinks. In addition there was also coffee. On the return flight, which departed at 2:30 PM, they gave us chicken sandwich, which we could not eat as we are vegetarians. This is the only drawback i could find and that is the reason I am giving 9 instead of 10. The arrival at LAX was on schedule.",1
2018-12-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Seoul via Honolulu,,,,,,1.0,2,I was not allowed to board,True,"  I was not allowed to board this flight because the Hawaiian Airlines representatives at the Honolulu Airport refused to recognize my US passport, which listed my name as given name first, then family name, as matching a reservation made in the Asian way, as last name first followed by given name. If Hawaiian Air wishes to continue offering flights to Asia, it needs to educate its staff about alternatives to the way names are listed in the US. Much of the world recognizes the last name first. Further, the woman at the counter was nasty, rude. I demanded to see her supervisor, who was unaware of naming conventions. For international flights, I would not recommend this airline.",-1
2018-12-02,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Sydney,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,2,worst flight experience,True," The first issue, the flight from Sydney to Honolulu. Couldn't go online to check-in until 24 hours before the flight, when I did login no seats available! I had been auto allocated a seat, same booking but my husband had not! At the airport the next day my husband was finally allocated a seat at the back of the plane row 47, I was seated in row 22! This was rectified just prior to boarding, not the best seats but we were seated together so this was appreciated. The return flight was a nightmare. They had automatically seated my husband & I in seats 25E & 26E, not together & stuck in the middle of the middle rows. (I have had bowel surgery so this option would have been extremely irritating to whoever sat next to me in seat F) No economy seats available so I was forced to pay an extra $125 USD each to sit in their 'economy premium seats' the only ones left 14c & 14d. Seat 14c, at the front of the section so not much legroom as there is a wall in front! 14c is on the aisle halfway in front of the door leading to the bathroom & service area with a constant flow of passengers passing & knocking me as they passed. The seat was broken & would not recline, so no sleep for me. On takeoff there was one meal selection, teriyaki chicken! The snack prior to landing was half an egg sandwich & half a ham & cheese sandwich. I'm fairly certain those sandwiches were more than one day old! Various other issues, service below par, water was not offered during the flight, well I should say the staff ran through the aisles with cups & water but they rushed past so fast most passengers missed out! To top this off I asked for a gin & tonic, they don't have gin, only scotch or vodka, I opted for a white wine instead which was terrible! So only water for me. Did I enjoy my flight, no! Did my husband enjoy his flight, no. Overall, this was the worst flight experience we have ever experienced! Incidentally, we have flown to Hawaii 12 times in the last 10 years. We have flown Hawaiian at least 4 times previously, last time in 2016, same trip and was happy with all details of our flight. Not this time!",-1
2018-10-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Lanai,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,delayed hours or canceled,True,"  Honolulu to Lanai. 75% of flights I've taken or tried to take have been delayed hours or canceled all together.  The worst part are the continual mechanical issues on this small aging fleet. Just several days ago the cabin filled with smoke and had to divert back to HNL. My advice, fly into OGG Kahului Maui, Uber or taxi over lo Lahaina and take the ferry. It may be more costly but you will feel safer and could very well beat the time you will lose during idle at the gate. You might even see some whales and dolphins on a side benefit.",-1

2018-10-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Portland,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,never recommend this airline,True,"  Honolulu to Portland. I originally bought my ticket for a 1:15pm flight that would have arrived at 10pm which was perfect timing for me as I needed to drive home another 2hrs so I'd arrive home around midnight. At first, it got changed to 1:30pm; no big deal, whatever. In the airport, it got delayed another 45mins; alright, okay, I can get over that. Then the departure time was changed to 6:15pm, 5hrs after the original time I purchased my ticket because the plane we were supposed to take wasn't functioning properly and we had to wait to switch planes with all new flight staff. We arrived to our destination at 3am. I did not get home until 5am. The compensation? A $20 food voucher for the airport we were stuck in that almost everyone the flight found useless as everyone was prepared fully to be on board with snacks and drinks ALREADY paid for (we had started boarding before it got delayed 5hrs) and most stores closed early so if you didn't grab the voucher and run somewhere quick, too bad for you. Then, you find out in flight, they had the gall to make you pay for a blanket! I'm sorry, if someone wanted a blanket, they should have been given one. It was a flight which turned into a red-eye and at the very least, blankets should have been given out. You had to pay for literally everything, at least give the people who were trying to sleep a blanket! Here's another issue, this 5hr delay caused my partner to need to call out of work the next day as they were my ride home. They lost a whole day's pay now. I had anxiety medications for flying and when I saw we were boarding, I assumed it was safe, so I took them and then when we were delayed, I was screwed out of my anxiety medications for the actual flight.  I will never recommend this airline and will never fly with it again.",-1

The aircraft when entered was like a refrigerator, when asked for a blanket, they needed a credit card to charge for it. Boarding the plane was like amateur hour. Group 1 over here, group 2 sit, group 3 over there. Nice colorful uniforms and lots of Alohas, but not much training. The plane was new and OK when it finally arrived. The flight was cheap but will definitely find a better airline next time. You can download their App and pay for movies on your phone, other than that no entertainment options. Very difficult to arrange seats if you want to sit together.",-1

I had very low expectations as we were flying just ahead of Hurricane Lanes approach. I was expecting disorganized delays and everything was actually perfect. Our short inter island flight was the same as always and our flight to Seattle was excellent. A great friendly cabin crew gave us excellent service as we comfortably sat for five hours. Although the seats aren’t extra wide they are comfy and go fully flat. The food was quite good and the crew really excelled which lately is not a given on Hawaiian. The flights were on time. All together a wonderful experience.,1

I met a man whose flight was cancelled the night before. His luggage was not returned to him and he had two young children. They spent the night in a small motel and were scheduled for an 11AM flight that was then also cancelled. No one was helping him.

Honolulu to Maui. This was the worst experience ever. I will never fly with Hawaiian Airlines again and I think no one else should either. First off the employees are very rude. I was asking one AO some questions and he told me to go ask ""questions at another gate"". I was on standby all day until the last flight out and for the most part no one said anything throughout the process besides how many other people were on standby. One employee was so loud when speaking to the customers, almost as if she hated dealing with customer's but that's her job. My husband and I are employees of another airline we paid for our tickets but was told by the male employee who previously told me to go away that we were on the bottom of the list because we are employees of another airline and booked through our flight benefits. We were later told by really nice AO's something different. In the past I flew with many airlines and overall this is the worst experience Hawaiian Airlines did not even offer food vouchers to their customers. To whom every is thinking of flying with this company I suggest you think long and hard.",-1

We requested to take the 8:45pm flight instead and we had no checked in luggage. The 8:45pm flight wasn't full but we were denied. They said there are fees associated with the change. Really? I guess there isn't any more bending backwards for customers. No logic!,-1

A wonderful experience on all sectors, the cabin staff were outstanding, and the flight deck were very informative on the conditions expected throughout the flight. Hawaiian music and videos welcomed us onboard, and set the mood for a very enjoyable flight. I usually travel Air New Zealand out of Los Angeles or San Francisco but decided to try Hawaiian as they fly out of Las Vegas. I am so glad I did and would like to thank all of the crew, both cabin and flight deck for a job well done! The only complaint is with Honolulu airport. It is certainly overdue for a complete overhaul.",1
2018-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Phoenix,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never had such a poor experience,True," I was beyond disappointed with Hawaiian Airlines. From the horrible customer service, rude flight attendants, planes that are so outdated and falling apart that nothing works on them. The terrible fees they charge. I left a carry on bag and when I tried to get a flight attendant from our flight to help me out with it I was met with a rude attitude and told I would just have to call the next day because she needed to meet her friend who was picking her up. When I asked if there was someone else she said there was no managers or staff or anyone in the entire airport that could help, I find that hard to believe considering the fact that our baggage hadn't even made it to baggage claim when I notified her that I left somthing behind. She made no effort to try to help at all and was clearly bothered by me even asking. The flight attendants on the plane weren't any friendlier either. When boarding the plane I was told my carry on wouldn't fit because this was a really old plane and the bins are small and hopefully my bags would make it cause that's reassuring. For the amount of money I spent to fly 7 people I would expect a lot more. I am doubtful I will get any help tomorrow regarding my carry on left behind. I have flown with many other airlines and never had such a poor experience.",-1
2018-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Kahului via Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,only got offered $50 refund!,True,"  Las Vegas to Kahului via Honolulu. Their customer affairs department that handles issues is only accessible via on-line submission form, and they're just going to send you the same response, no matter whether it resolves your problem or not. If you call - they will tell you there is no way to talk to consumer affairs department, and just keep sending them messages.  We boarded a plane and were sitting on the plane for 1.5 hrs with no idea of why we are not taking off. Nobody was able to give us any information on what kind of “issues” are those. We had to get off the plane and only after numerous inquiries and concerns raised one of the staff told us it was an issue with pilot’s communication system. 2 hours later from the original departure time, we boarded the plane again, and took off. The plane was freezing cold and I was told I have to purchase blankets if we’re cold, and they can’t change the temperature. Other people were freezing too, and there was nothing done about it. Additionally, there were electrical issues and our monitors weren’t working for a long time. They said we will all get unlimited entertainment package for our inconvenience, but it never happened. 20 min into the flight one of the passengers had medical issue. Within minutes this man collapsed in front of our eyes and they started performing CPR on him, alternating with oxygen mask. After the plane started flying back we got an announcement that it was turned around. Back at Honolulu we were waiting for at least another hour for all of the medical procedures, and police investigation, before we could get off the plane to switch the planes. By the gate we were told to wait in line for food vouchers and new seat assignments.  It was chaos to say the least as all of us were trying to get food at only one restaurant that was opened by the gate. There was not enough fast food left after first batch of people went through it, and ordering food was impossible as they said they won’t be able to make enough for everyone in time. It was past 9pm at this point, and we have been traveling since 10am. We boarded a new plane which was an older plane and it was freezing again! And we were sitting on a plane for an hour with no announcements or letting us know what’s going on. Later they were waiting on a second pilot. Why were we rushed to get on the plane with no time to eat, if the pilot was not even there? Entertainment systems were still locked, and we got offered no comfort, drinks or anything after everything we have been thru. Back home, their luggage process got screwed up with mixing bags from different flights, and nobody from the staff knew what's going on. After all of that, we only got offered $50 refund! Absolutely ridiculous! And there is no way to talk to someone, and all we get is that consumer affairs approved $50 and good luck with that.",-1

Halfway through our family vacation, in Hawaii, my father passed away. When I contacted Hawaiian Airlines to change my flight they wanted $400 to do so. I was blown away by the clerks attitude we were working with, so insensitive and would not cooperate in any way. It was cheaper for me to purchase a return flight than to change my existing flight. My wife thought that she would appreciate my empty seat, she would be more comfortable on the return flight with the kids. She checked in my seat for which I could not get a refund or any consideration. A smelly beach bum tried sit in my seat. My wife told him that it was not his because we paid for it! The stewardess told my wife it was his seat because they resold my seat to him. WOW! Talk about double dipping into our pockets. I am so upset at how Hawaiian Airlines has treated my family and great lack of customer service or consideration. I can never use them again and I would not recommend them. By the way they charge for just about everything. The dinners that we had going out and coming back were horrible. A terrible value in general and poor customer service.",1

The two airlines were booked on separate itineraries. The change moved not only the time from several hours to about 1.5 hours, but also we had to stop in HNL and change planes. I called Hawaiian Airlines customer service about what to do and got 'maybe this, maybe that', in other words, no help. Arrived at the originating airport from Mainland to The Islands early, that airline was more than helpful, even though separate itineraries, that airline was able to check our bags through to final destination",-1

When booking my families tickets I decided to pay extra to fly Hawaiian because I had heard positive reviews of the airline before but I was surprisingly disappointed. On both flights I was excited about getting a window seat but on both flights the window seat did not have a window but rather just a wall to look at. The in-flight entertainment app did not work and the flight attendants skipped past both me and my brother when handing out food. During the flight I saw that all the bathrooms near me were occupied and saw a bathroom sign that said it was unoccupied towards the front. After walking to the front bathroom a flight attendant blocked me with their arms and told me (quite rudely) that I was not allowed back there.

Taking into account that the price difference between coach and Business Class was $50, and that luggage is included, I would most likely pay the difference again. The seat was a big, comfortable chair with enough leg space. We sipped our Hawaiian cocktails and enjoyed the splendid view outside the window.

The lines for bag check in and for security — for TSA Pre too— were around out of the terminal and around the block. Gee, HNL is Hawaiian Airlines’ hub; one would expect that they would have their check in act together on their home turf. Not. Almost missed my flight. The food selection in flight was incredibly limited, and Hawaiian did not even offer the option to buy a meal. Really? On a 5 hour flight? Hard to believe. The flght attendants are also starting to catch the disease normally associated with other airlines: Surly-itis. It took 45 minutes for my bag to appear in baggage claim.

First time flying with Hawaiian Airlines and I must say we got good value for money. Air New Zealand have been fleecing New Zealanders for years on this sector for years so it's great to see competition. The cabins are very airy and simple, seat room in economy was ok and the seat was comfy enough. The cabin crew were very friendly and had a nice Hawaiian relaxed style. Communication from the flight deck was excellent re flight times, turbulence etc. Meal service was good as was bar service. Despite the cheaper ticket price, Hawaiian is a full service airline and you're luggage is on the piece system, good for bringing back you're outlet shopping! We will definitely fly Hawaiian next time we go up to Honolulu and further.",1

Terrible in cabin service on the way to Hawaii and the way home. The cabin was so cold, we were offered blanket for $10 but when we went to buy one they didn't have anymore so we froze the whole 6 1/2 hr flight. The food was terrible also, so we were cold and hungry by the time we arrived. After voluntarily checking 2 of our bags when asked, due to limited baggage space due to a totally full flight. The appreciation we got for that was a totally cracked suitcase with no explanation.",-1

I had the gate slammed at my face after my wife and I spent close to 40 mins at the TSA line. We were roughly one minute late. We explained to the Hawaiian Airline staff at the boarding gate what happened and they reported that they could not let us board the plane due to ""security reasons"". The plane waited on the tarmac for 20 more mins after our experience before taking off. Within this period of trying to negotiate, 9 other people who were late came up to the gate with the same TSA complaint. We noted and reported that other airline staff tried to help get their passengers quickly through the TSA lines but Hawaiian airline staff did not. We were asked to rebook our flight, only for us to get a quote for $2200 dollars for (2) one way ticket from New York to Hawaii for my wife and I - twice the cost of my return ticket. This was predatory and exploitative. We were upset but paid it as we were attending an annual medical conference in Hawaii and had paid for extra courses as well which we did not want to miss. I should have flown United, Delta or American Airlines. My friends who did had a better experience in terms of friendliness and consideration of their ground staff and cabin staff. We spent 20 extra hours trying to reach our destination and paid dearly for the one minute delay in getting to the boarding gate. Please avoid this airline at all costs. We are in the times where airlines are trying to redeem their image. Unfortunately Hawaiian does not give a rat's behind about customers and diplomacy as long as you have paid for your tickets.",-1

I had a total of 6 flights scheduled during my honeymoon in Hawaii. The total cost of all the ""island hopping"" flights is about $600 dollars. I needed to change my flight because of blizzard in the eastern U.S (NY to DC) that has 2500 flights canceled. They are a partner of United, my carrier to Hawaii and you should be able to change due to inclement weather. I needed to push each flight back one day. After waiting on hold for one hour they tell me they want to charge me about $400 to change the flights (75% of the cost). They said maybe to try having a United rep call to change the flight. I call back with a United Rep. They want to charge me $400 for the flight. Speaking with their customer service reps is a miserable experience. All offshore reps which doesn't always have to be unpleasant but I felt like I was speaking to the mafia with these folks. Every other hotel and airline I called to reschedule due to this snow blizzard were nice and had no issue changing. This airlines customer service is rotten to the core. Stay away.",-1

They let people in the plane, we were waiting for 1 hour inside the plane (it was really cold and when i asked for the blanket they said its extra cost). Finally they let us out and said its gonna be a delay, because engine was broken and they were trying to fix. Mechanics were trying to fix it for the good 6 hours, airline was promising every hour that soon we will depart. After all they couldn't fix the engine and something else was damaged on the plane (it was really old, scary how they let such old planes to operate). After 6 hours at the airport and official note from the airline that the flights is canceled i went to Hawaiian ticket counter and they issued new tickets for me and my husband for the next day with another airline, and thanks god i checked it by the evening and found out that reservation wasn't existing. They issued the ticket wrong. The company is hard to get a hold of, i had to wait 40 minutes calling from 2 different phones at the same time. Finally the representative answered and she said that they can't refund money for the flight or to change it The result, 6 hours in the airport, 2 hours on the phone, no money back nothing.

2018-02-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Honolulu,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3,has been a complete mess with rude service,True," My family of five was scheduled for Flight HA 11 from San Francisco to Honolulu with a departure time of 8.55am. At around 8.16am, there was an announcement regarding the flight being delayed for 7 hours with a new scheduled departure of 4.30pm. When we were all moved to a different gate, we stood in line for about 20-30 minutes when another announcement came on asking everyone with the delayed flight to take a seat and that accommodations would be made. We sat and waited for a while and around 9.40am, I noticed people who had been on the delayed flight were able to check into the another flight, 41. So I went to wait in line to ask if we could be accommodated. After getting to the counter, the employee who assisted us, said it was possible and stated she needed everyone up at the counter. I signaled to my family but as we were boarding, I realized my husband wasn’t there. I called him and he had gone out of the gate area thinking we would not be accommodated. My kids and I came back out of the tunnel area and I apologized and told the agent we would wait for the 4.30pm flight since my husband wasn’t there. At this, she became upset and yanked the tickets from my hand and all three of my kids’ hands angrily. I apologized again and she made a comment stating “This is why I asked if everyone in your party was here.” I responded that I thought we were. She then raised her voice stating that “you guys are the reason why this flight (41) is delayed”. As upset and frustrated as I already was about a 7 hour delay on our original flight, I had been patient but could not believe my ears when she accused me and my kids of causing a delay in the flight when 1) there were still individuals going into the tunnel at the time we stepped out and 2) after our original flight was delayed for 7.5 hrs and we were told to sit down and they would take care of accommodations. I can understand there can be flight delays but it does not justify the workers being hostile. I did respond that it (causing the delay on 41 even though that wasn’t the case because she was still checking in someone else) wouldn’t have happened if the original flight wasn’t delayed. Also, at this time, there were still other customers who were going into the tunnel area. This is my family’s first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines and it has been a complete mess with rude service. When there are flights delayed for 7.5 hours, I would think that the airline would better train their employees to understand the frustration of its customers instead of blaming them for causing another delayed flight or yanking tickets out of kids’ hands when there are additional people boarding after.",-1

Honolulu has a very old airport that cannot handle the traffic causing numerous delays and problems getting to the gate and going through security. It took 2.5 hours to check in! One of the worst airports in the US. We were stuck on the taxiway for 45 minutes after landing in HNL due to no gate available. The food was awful and they do not offer options based on dietary needs or a second choice for food. They do not give frequent flyer points or status credits if you booked a sale fare. That was an unpleasant surprise. Plus the planes are very old and cramped. Far less leg room than other airlines.,-1
2017-12-27,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Sacramento,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,3,Travel with caution,True,"  Honolulu to Sacramento. Travel with extra time on your hands. Three out of four flights coming home from HNL have had delays. Lost something to do with the motor one the first flight. This flight was from Maui to San Jose, California. We were forced us to turn around about an hour out from Hawaii and land at HNL. That caused everyone to spend several hours in a very separated airport terminal. Away from any real food. But we were given snacks and waters! Second flight went fine. Our third flight was delayed over seven hours at the airport. We arrived at 5 am when we should have arrived at 10 pm the night prior. Hawaiian never compensated us for the delay. They have continued to lose our paperwork, strange. Our last flight (fourth), was delayed two hours due to a malfunctioning piece of equipment. Which they fixed and got us underway. I learned the after the first run-in with the Hawaiian staff. You won't win at the airport. They can be rude and dishonest with the best of them. A small riot almost broke out in the airport due to all the passengers be kept in the dark over the ""status of repairs"". They had pieces of the plane that were the size of a small car laying on the ground with zero maintenance staff anywhere. They even went so far as to bring a standby pilot to sit in the cockpit and act like something was going to happen. Hours went by with no repairs and no answers. That's when it got out of hand, passengers yelling at the staff for answers. They finally were forced to put everyone in a hotel for the night. The next morning we reboarded the repaired plane and another mechanical issue forced us back to the gate. Several people just got up and left the flight. After all that, they still managed to lose our luggage. Still never received compensation for the damaged bag either. They keep losing that paperwork as well. Travel with caution.",-1
2017-12-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Honolulu,1.0,,3.0,1.0,,2.0,1,decline in quality and service,True,"  Portland to Honolulu. I used to love traveling back home to Oahu on Hawaiian Airlines. Key words: ""used to"". I am not sure when their decline in quality and service happened but it's a real bummer. I had my trip back home planned for over six months. My boyfriend decided to tag along and bought his ticket a month before. Not knowing Hawaiian declined, I boasted how great of an airline it is. I wanted his first trip to Hawaii to start off great and felt confident he'd have a great ride. We arrived to HNL within 15 mins of each other. This was the first time I rode home on United and it was great! I ran over to the Hawaiian terminal with a fresh lei in hand so I could give my bf a proper Hawaiian greeting as he walked out. After giving him his lei I asked how his flight was. ""terrible, this was the WORST airline I ever rode on! They had no entertainment on the flight, no complimentary meal and everyone was terribly rude!"" I didn't believe him and joked that maybe he got on the wrong plane. On the way back home after a great week on Oahu, his flight was delayed and then delayed again for another two hours after they boarded. I thought for sure his flight was a fluke with Hawaiian. Well, here I am today. Christmas Day 2017. My father called last night to let me know my grandma would be passing. Hawaiian Airlines was the only airline with a seat on the earliest flight out so I booked it knowing I'd be in comfort.  Lo and behold, the flight was a half hour delayed because their caterers had trouble getting the food on board. Then they finally board us! Nope. I am sitting here almost two hours later, as they decided to fuel up and de-ice after boarding passengers. Why would any airline make its customers wait on board in cramped chairs when we already have a long flight ahead? So, I decided to bide my time by watching some entertainment. No! I guess my bf wasn't lying all along, there is none! Bad on their part, now my only source of entertainment is to write this (what should be 0) one star review. In addition to their decline in quality, a single bag check used to be free. Now $25. Haven't had my in-flight meal yet but I'm wondering if I'll have to pay premo-prices for the food the caterers probably dropped all over the place when they had a hard time loading it up and delaying the flight.  As I'm typing this they just announced another hour delay. Here's to three hours wasted! Let's hope Hawaiian Airline's delays don't make me late from seeing my grandma one last time! Time to sign off. The lady behind me is starting to panic from feeling claustrophobic.",-1

First they changed our flight to leave earlier, with a layover in Honolulu for four hours. And to make it even better they lost our luggage. And they also cannot scan the barcode for our luggage because Hawaiian airlines does not offer that. However they give you a barcode for your luggage when you check your bag, but it doesn’t work.

Very slow and unfriendly service from Hawaiian Airlines. They treat customers like products, not people.

Flight from SYD-HNL was reasonable only because they had a great crew who were young, happy and willing to help, the return flight though was the complete opposite, old crew who were aggressive and indifferent to passengers, a real contrast a perhaps Hawaiian need to look at removing staff like these to improve customer experience. Seats were very cramped with very little leg room and the meals were both very small and tasteless (rice was solid like a rock), Hawaiian need to understand they have not only Qantas and Jetstar running this route but Air NZ and Fiji Airways so they can't rely on their name when their product is so poor.",-1

During the flight I had to go to the toilet. The toliet was occupied so I attempted to go to the other side of the plane. The male flight attendant was in the galley so rather than disturb him I waited for the toilet to vacate. He then told me rudely to stop ""mulling"" around that area, so I started to go back to my seat, but then he said the other one was vacant. After using the other toilet I had no way of getting back to the other side of plane so I attempted to go back through the galley but then he critisied me again for going through that area and spoke ""rudely"" to me (in front of other passengers). I absolutely refuse to accept this type of rude behaviour, to a paying passenger from a flight attendant. The female attendants were not rude but this male attendant needs to have a close look at himself and this behaviour towards passengers. We will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.",-1

We made a mistake in our booking and didn't realize that we had scheduled our return flight from the big island out of the wrong airport with united airlines. While united wanted to charge us $4000 to get us home, Hawaiian worked very hard to find a different route home for us even though we hadn't been using their airline!! They even checked our bags all the way to Toronto for free because they wanted to help! I have never had any airline treat me so well! It's just a shame that we can't fly Hawaiian for all of our flights! We are so pleased. Their ticketing agents were amazingly helpful!",1

I wish I could say Hawaiian was any different from any US-based airline. Customer service is pretty mediocre, bordering on rude at times. Our flight did not include individual TV screens, only shared TV screens that showed things like a Hawaii city council meeting and public access type television programming. The food was inedible - lukewarm breakfast sandwiches with fruit that tasted old. The airline staff were very curt with us. At one point we asked about early boarding because we had a child with us, and the desk agent snapped that it wasn't our turn yet. Okay, that's why we were asking. We had to check in our stroller at the gate and when we arrived at Lihue, it took us 20 minutes to find an airline staff who could tell us where the stroller was. We were told they'd bring it to us, then it turned out to be behind the desk. We flew Hawaiian because we figured it would be better than United, but it's really the same level of bad service just disguised with a lei.",-1

I was not aware of this policy and never before when I flew with Hawaiian Airlines was I denied my ticket to fly. There is no policy about checking in on time on your itinerary so the only way you can find out about this bad news is if you get it first from the desk. I was then printed a ticket for a flight an hour after my original flight, and when everything was done, I went off to TSA line and got to my original gate in 2 mins. I arrived at the gate 20 mins before boarding even began and I was denied entry on board by the Hawaiian employees. They were not being friendly at all and wanted to just go on their ""lunch break"" at 6:28pm. Very unprofessional of these people. I was also belittled by one of them when claiming that is my plane that I should be on and they were asking me in a very condescending way if I want my ticket back as I gave it to one of the ladies for confirmation. I was and am still disgusted with Hawaiian Airlines and their customer service. I feel cheated that I had to still pay them for the pet cabin too because I had my pet in her kennel all the time waiting eagerly to get home. They email me later asking how my flight was and on the bottom it had their checking in Policy with different information then what I was told by all the employees.",-1

After making calls and rechecking the situation, apparently the email was a mistake, there was nothing wrong with the flight. After being mistreated at check in where the attendant didn't help to arrange the seats for me and my husband to sit next to each other, the airplane, very old by the way, had a technical problem causing departure delay.

This trip was two very short flights, less than an hour in the air total, but Hawaiian left me with a good impression. The seats and plane interiors are nothing special, but for flights this short it doesn't matter - I've flown long haul with them and on those flights they're great. On this trip, despite checking in all the way to Lihue, for some reason my bag was only checked to Honolulu. I wasn't told this when checking in, so I arrived at Lihue to find my bag hadn't come with me. This was annoying, but the way Hawaiian handled it couldn't have been better. I was on the last flight for the night, but when I rang at 8am the next morning, my bag had already arrived. Then, a couple of days later, I noticed the fee I had paid for checked luggage refunded to my bank account, without me even asking. Every company makes mistakes sometimes, but if they all handled them like Hawaiian did, the world would be a much nicer place.",1

Check in: automated counters weren't working, so everyone had to be manually checked in, took around 30 mins of waiting. Service staff at the counter couldn't even manage a smile. But was a smooth process despite the minor flaws. Boarding: boarded in zones, worked well, was slightly delayed due to the incoming flight being slightly delayed. Staff kept everyone well informed. Couldn't ask for more. Inflight: air crew were very casually dressed, fitted with the Hawaiian vibe. Weren't as tight and efficient as Thai airways or Etihad. Still the staff were friendly and seemed like they cared about passengers having a good experience. There was no power port on the plane, only USB charging for low power devices. The seats were uncomfortable with very thin cushions, the seats recline quite a bit but there's hardly any leg room. I'm not a tall person but my knees were mashed into the seat in front most of the flight. They provided a pillow and a blanket as well as headphones and earplugs which are necessary as this aircraft was very loud. Meals: dinner was a casserole/curry with rice and beans which was pretty good. There was some coon cheese, and a dairy milk. Staff offered a large range of beverages. Breakfast was a bit dissappointing as there was no hot meal, I got a yoghrt, a bread piece with jam and butter and a cinnamon muffin. Overall was acceptable for the price",1

Happy to see a big improvement in the front cabin after a few years of decline. The newly designed cabin is randomly available on domestic routes, always available on certain routes and will be a standard in the next year. Although it seems like they spent as little as they could. Entertainment is via a large iPad attached to a pole that pulls out like a tray table. Odd but it's fine. The meal was quite good for domestic first class as well. The strength, when it is there is their bright light that can shine from Hawaiian people. Both attendants today were in the most Hawaiian way, gracious warm and great at their job. I hope it's a trend. Seats and entertainment matter but Hawaiians strength is in their hospitality. When it works, it's world class. When it's off you notice the less then great cabin. One more thing and it's big. No Wi-Fi and no plans. Big mistake, bad calculation on their part.",1

While checking in 24 hrs in advance I get a seat assigned and my wife does not. They were under airport control. Reached gate 90 mins before departure and we were asked to either take last row or pay $80 more per ticket to be able to sit together. Seriously? 15 years of flying and this is the first time. Airline food overall is average but Hawaiian airlines has below average food.

I had trouble to use the self service check in machine in the Honolulu. The customer service officer yelled out useless instructions as I am a kid making a mistake in the classroom. She was not even bothered to walk 5 steps down to have a look. When I eventually got the instruction to go to the counter for check in. I asked to keep the original seats but the guy said no seat left and give me two seats in the middle ""D"" in row 36 and 38"" regardless my mother is 80 non English speaking and I need going to bathroom as the health issue.

This packed flight left more than two hours late because of a mechanical problem, arriving in Sacramento after midnight rather than 9:55 pm. We eventually were told, after takeoff, that the delay had something to do with the brakes. But we were kept in the dark until then. In the air, finally, we were told by way of apology that adults could have white or red wine without charge. But when I asked for white wine I was poured maybe two ounces - considerably less than half of one of those small plastic cups. We were also told that, also by way of apology, that after (so-called) dinner the movie Moana would be shown to the entire plane on the public screens and via loudspeakers. This two-hour kids' movie was thusly imposed on everyone who didn't have a noise-canceling headset. I've flown this route on Hawaiian a number of times because Hawaiian is the only carrier that does it nonstop. I've come to detest Hawaiian as a result. It is poorly run, unreliable, unresponsive, expensive, penny-pinching, and self-regarding. Stay away if you can.",-1
2017-03-25,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Oakland to Oahu,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,She went above and beyond,False,"  I recently flew from Oakland to Honolulu and had the best flying experience ever! I give 100% credit to an amazing Flight Attendant. When we first got seated, there was a gentlemen who had taken a seat that was reserved for another customer. The gentlemen wanted to sit closer to his family who was in the middle isle but the customer who purchased a seat on the isle did so because she was breast feeding and had to pump during the flight and wanted easy access to and from the bathroom. The gentlemen sat in her seat and rudely wouldn't move. The FA noticed what had happened and did an amazing job resolving the situation for the customer who rightfully purchased her seat for accessibility. She did so in a very professional manner. Later in the flight the same FA asked if my wife and I had been to Hawaii before and we shared that this was our first trip. We explained that we had been trying to go for 18 years. We asked her for local recommendations and she later came back with a personal list that she created which today we spent the day visiting many of the destinations she recommended and candidly made our trip the best trip ever. As a Director of Sales for a large organization, I am constantly working with my staff to focus on the customer and deliver awesome customer experiences. Today, this FA made my wife and I huge promoters of Hawaiian Airlines. She went above and beyond to serve customers and did an awesome job doing so!",1
2017-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kauai to Kahului,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,experience ruined,False,"  Will not fly with Hawaiian Airlines again. Booked day flight specifically for views between Kauai and Maui, they changed us from a window seat to the last row even though we booked and confirmed a month ago. This is the flight I was most looking forward to in the islands, experience ruined. Took forever to board, had to wait for another Hawaiian air flight to depart for 30 min on tarmac despite arriving on time. You have other options nowadays, take them.",-1
2017-03-17,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Kahului,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,I would definitely fly them again,False,"  This was my first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines so I was very excited. It was a short, inter-island flight from Honolulu to Kahului. We departed on time and were in the air for only about 15 minutes. This meant that their was no in-flight entertainment but that was expected and it didn't pose any kind of problem because the view outside the window was enough entertainment for me! The flight was most enjoyable. The cabin crew was very kind and friendly. They passed out water or juice but also took requests from passengers if they wanted a different beverage. They also handed out a travel guide of Maui with a map and a list of activities to do. I had never experienced this on another airline so this was very touching. Landing was very smooth despite the wind and turbulence. I was very impressed! This was very good experience and if I ever return to Hawaii I would definitely fly them again!",1
2017-02-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,We'll never fly them again,False,"  Los Angeles to Honolulu. Terrible customer service. I accidentally booked my wife's ticket under her maiden name. They wouldn't let us change the name on the ticket. They forced us to purchase a new ticket and cancel the old one, the price difference was $750 (they will let you change a single letter for $200). What a scam. She almost missed her flight (her daughter was already on the flight). Basically they robbed us. Awful people, awful airline. We'll never fly them again.",-1
2017-02-07,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to PEK,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,5,kind service attitude,False," Flew on Hawaiian Airlines flight HA897 from Honolulu to Beijing. I was very touched by the ground staff service. I am Chinese national (currently studying in Singapore) and my passport was stolen in Hilo. It was urgent to get back to China, get my new passport done before returning to Singapore, in order not to miss so lessons. However, there is no Chinese embassy in Hawaii. HA understood my special case scenario and allowed me to fly back to China without the original passport. In the airport, the HA ground staff as well as HNL airport ground staff were very kind and found a way to help. They took the initiative to contact the immigration checkpoint in both USA and China, they tried their best to let me board the aircraft. I was anxious about it and they consoled me and told me I would be fine. I managed to get back to China safe and sound. I'm was very impressed by the kind service attitude, otherwise, I would have to opt for a more troublesome way which is to fly 5 hours to LAX and visit the embassy there.",1
2017-02-06,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,KOA to HNL,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,4.0,4,not an enjoyable experience,False," Flew on Hawaiian Airlines flight HA137 from Kona to Honolulu. This airline uses the old B717 for all inter-island flights. Only water is served and the crews were very cold towards passengers. The announcement was unclear on this old aircraft. It's not an enjoyable experience but I would not say I don't recommend HA for this route, because the only airlines operate this route are HA and Island Air which are around the same standard.",1
2017-02-03,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Hilo,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,4,I recommend Hawaiian Airlines,False,"  Inter island flight from Honolulu to Hilo. This rather short flight is operated by a 20-year-old Boeing 717. The aircraft was old and there were no personal IFEs, but the seats were more comfortable than what I imagined. Only drinks were served on this short flight. But overall the experience was not bad, the check in, boarding process was smooth and the cabin crews were very helpful. HA offers 14 flights a day on this route. I recommend Hawaiian Airlines, especially to day trippers. As you can book a package tour, which gives you a one day return ticket from Honolulu and you can tour the volcano national park in Hilo.",1

Service was adequate but not to the same standards as Singapore Airlines, Emirates or Qantas. The food provided was minimal with just a chicken/rice dish option and a sandwich just prior to landing. Check-in was functional.",-1
2016-10-18,0.3,Business,First Class,KOA to OGG,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,3,ground staff more and more unfriendly,False," Kona to Kahului. I fly Hawaiian Airlines pretty often, the ground staff are getting more and more unfriendly. They fly the oldest planes in the industy. A good example what a lack of competition on some routes does to the overall motivation to provide a good service. I feel bad for those of the crew who try to provide a good service.",-1
2016-10-18,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to HNL,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3,not a very pleasant journey,False,"  
Not a very pleasant journey with Hawaiian Airlines from New York to Honolulu. My 10 hour trip was very boring, since almost all entertainment (movies, tv shows, music) was provided only when extra money was paid (3.99$ or 7.99$ for movies). There was one very small meal at the beginning of the flight and an even smaller snack at the end of the flight. You had to pay extra for all alcoholic beverages (8$) and I even had to refill water myself numerous times, since flight attendands were mostly hanging out in the service area. The plane was comfortable enough and clean, but it was rather cold inside with no wifi.",-1
2016-10-17,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to BNE,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2,a budget airline at best,False, Flew Brisbane to Honolulu and return with Hawaiian Airlines. Flight out was very uncomfortable. When the person in front of you puts their seat back all the way it's very claustrophobic. This happened to me 5 mins after take off and I had to endure it for the whole flight. Seats too close together for long haul. We got a sandwich shortly after take off which was barely edible. Breakfast was scrambled egg potato cake and a rasher of bacon with tomato. I ate as I was so hungry but it wasn't good. The aircraft was 4 years old and was clean. The screens for the TVs are old. Singapore where using these screens 15 years ago. All in all not a very enjoyable flight. Return journey was even worse. Had to go back to concourse after taxiing out due to malfunction in air conditioning unit. Left to sit in aircraft for 1.5 hours and not even offered a drink of water. Aircraft was much older this time and very dirty. I could scrape black dirt off from around the TV screens. Crew looked a little scruffy I have to say but friendly enough. Food was pork with rice then a sandwich later in the flight. All in all was expecting much more from this airline. I would say this was a budget airline at best but then I think I would be doing a disservice to budget airlines.,-1
2016-08-02,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SYD to HNL,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,5,meals were really nice,False," Sydney to Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines. Flight HA451 seat 29J on a 1 year old Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Being an international flight your ticket price includes baggage, pre seat assignment, meals dinner and breakfast, drinks, entertainment, blanket, pillow and amenity kit with head phones. The seats have the usual economy class legroom and width which was okay for the 10 hour flight. The entertainment screens in the back of the seat were a nice size on the newer aircraft. Main streams movie choice is limited and somewhat dated but you can find easily find something to watch. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. There are 9 cabin crew on the aircraft which is less than Qantas so you do notice a slower response time to requests as the crew are busy. Meals were really nice, no choice but that was fine and really tasty. The tray was full with a salad, cheese and crackers and chocolate. Pictures below are of dinner and breakfast box. Drinks and then dinner service was right after takeoff while breakfast was 1.5 hours prior to landing. Maybe a little bit too long considering when dinner was served. Snacks can be purchased between meals. Overall a good flight and airline.",1
2016-07-28,1.0,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LAX to OGG,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4,had a very pleasant experience,False,"  Our check-in process with Hawaiian Airlines was very easy. Had no trouble. We had decided to fly into Los Angeles to catch our first flight experience on Hawaiian. I've had awful experiences on American, Delta, and former US Airways. All were awful and had heard about the incredible flights with Hawaiian. Our needs were met and we were comfortable waiting for our 1.00pm departure to Maui. The flight was quite smooth. Quiet and comfortable. Our inflight meal was excellent. We were not expecting a meal service due to our previous experience with other US carriers. The crew and pilots were attentive and courteous. We had a very pleasant experience and vowed to never fly anyone else out to the islands. Hawaiian will have our business from this point onward. We only wish they flew in Texas where we can hop and enjoy a longer ride with Hawaiian.",1
2016-07-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to SYD,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,worst airline with worst service,False,"  The worst airline with the worst service I've encountered. We flew Sydney - Honolulu and paid extra for 'comfort class' seating to quickly realise none of the entertainment units worked so we ha to move. Waste of $$. Yesterday we set off to Sydney from Honolulu and 4 hours into the flight the captain tells us we are leaking fuel and we had to return to Honolulu. 8 hours later and back to Honolulu. Disembark and wait another hour for buses to arrive to pick us up, arrive at hotel and told they'll only pay for one nights accomodation - even though we can't get a flight for another 4 days. Given conflicting information by call centre and hung up on. Waste of time, money and ruined our holiday.",-1

Departure with some delay, but the plane was very clean and the seat was comfortable. Cabin crew always available and nice. Food was average. Only problem was the Inflight entertainment which was only available if you paid for it.",1
2016-05-25,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to SYD,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,5,major let down was the food,False,"  Honolulu to Sydney and return Brisbane to Honolulu on Hawaiian Airlines. Both flights were on time. The cabin crew was somewhat friendly, seats were comfortable and the entertainment was good (AVOD with dozens of movies). The major let down was the food. The main meal on the HNL-SYD flight, served shortly after take-off and the only option (no choices), consisted of some overly sweet chicken dish and was barely edible. At the end of the flight to SYD we were served 2 sandwiches which tasted ok, certainly better than the first meal. On the overnight return segment BNE-HNL we only got a pack of mystery meat sandwiches which were truly disgusting plus some ok single-choice breakfast before landing. Additional snacks were available on the flights but had to be purchased. Hawaiian Airlines could be a great airline if they just got the food right. I flew on a really cheap ticket so I can't really complain but if I had to pay the regular price I'd rather fly another airline with similar prices.",1
2016-05-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,LAX to HNL,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1,very disappointed with the upgrade,False,"  The upgrade was $75.00 each way to Hawaii with my 79 year old mother for a funeral. Flew from Los Angeles to Honolulu. On the way to Hawaii my mother had to sit on the pillows because the seat was old and had no cushion left in it. We had no water or juice when we boarded. We had plenty of leg space because we were at the front of the upgraded seats in row 11, but the seat was not wider and did not have any extra arm space and did not lay back any further than a regular seat. The food was the same as the regular cabin, it was not upgraded. On the night flight we were given noodles with a red sauce, spinach, mushroom slices and cheese, nothing you would want to eat again. A small salad, and a cookie that was about 2""s long in the shape of a pineapple. On the same plastic tray as economy seats. On the morning flight on the way home was a cheese and egg sandwich that was inedible with some fruit and a chocolate covered macadamia nut. The latest movies you had to pay $7.99 each for, they are free on other upgraded flights with other airlines. I was very disappointed with the upgrade, they should be ashamed to have offered this service.",-1
2016-05-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,SYD to HNL and return,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1,we were less than impressed,False,"  My partner and I decided to fly what Hawaiian Airlines call First Class for a 12 day vacation in Honolulu. Last year we traveled extensively around the world in Business Class with Korean Air and Qantas. Flat beds were the norm, with amazing service, plentiful quality meals and hot snacks, a wide variety of wines and a large entertainment library on both airlines. The only positive with Hawaiian Airlines was the fact that we were able to access the Qantas Business Lounge prior to departure out of Sydney as Qantas is the handling agent for Hawaiian. The Qantas Business Lounge is superb. Now back to Hawaiian Airlines, when we boarded, (seats 1A and 1B), we were less than impressed from the start. The seats were antiquated, with very little space between rows and with no electronic function. There was no locker for our jackets and upon seating we were handed a menu and asked immediately what our selection would be for dinner, not much time to peruse the menu but the selections seemed appetising. When the meals were delivered, on a tray, similar to most airlines economy class they were disappointing, small portions and the hot component on both different choices coming out lukewarm. We were offered red or white wines with no explanation of variety or country of origin. The snacks offered during the flight consisted of a small bag of crisps and a cookie. When I asked for a small bottle of water, I was asked by the Flight Attendant didn't I get one earlier in the flight, when I replied yes but I would like another they reluctantly gave me one. During the flight we discovered that the seats would only recliner a small amount, making the 10 hour journey most uncomfortable. We still encroached the space of the passengers behind us despite the limited pitch. My seat squeaked, and my partners leg rest would not function. Having spent a considerable amount of money, ($7500), on two return tickets we feel totally ripped off. Hawaiian Airlines First/Business Class is similar to most international carriers Economy Class. Do not waste your money on such an inferior product.",-1
