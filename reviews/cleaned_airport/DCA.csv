2024-04-25,0.6,Business,3,4,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,I found the Airport was improving,True,"  I used this airport several times past few years. This time I was traveling to Greenville, SC. I found the Airport was improving in terms of services and facilities. This airport is not too large one, but it has all basic facilities. Moreover, it is located in the central of Washington DC.",1
2023-12-02,0.8,Couple Leisure,5,4,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,barely a wait to go through security,True,"  This review applies only to Terminal 1 (Arrival & Departure). For one of the busiest days of the travel season (Sunday after Thanksgiving), the terminal was busy but surprisingly uncrowded. From the boarding areas, there are views of the airfield and parking apron. Seating is plenty though at busier times there can be a dearth of seating. Food options are limited given the size of the terminal. To order food, the iPads which contained flight info, links to newspapers and magazines have been eliminated. U now have to us a QR code to scan the menu from your phone. WiFi service is excellent. Easy to connect and fast. There was barely a wait to go through security with TSA-Pre. The bathrooms on both arrival and departure were clean with an attendant cleaning the bathrooms frequently. Terminal 1 lacks a lounge, nonetheless its a good terminal.",1
2023-10-27,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,4,,5.0,0.0,,,,"Overall, a good airport",True,"  This review applies to Terminal 2 only (American Airlines). Transited through a rather busy Reagan National. There are great views for the airfield from the D concourse, terminal building and E concourse. The walk from the end of D concourse to the end of E concourse is rather long and with only a 40 minutes connection, I made it to the connecting gate in E concourse with 10 minutes to spare. Overall, a good airport and terminal to transit through.",1
2022-09-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,5,4,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,purchase option was with a smart phone,False,  I was disappointed in the fact that I wished to purchase an alcoholic beverage during my layover with Southwest Airlines and found out that the only purchase option was with a smart phone. I don't have that type of phone and there wasn't an available restaurant that could accommodate me. I feel that was discrimination for the public that doesn't use that type of phone. What are you doing to accommodate that portion of the population? We're not all what you would like. if you want us you need to make it easier.,-1
2022-08-29,0.2,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,Waiting on the tarmac for an hour,False,"  Arrived in time but getting a gate took an hour, and same happened when going from Washington to New York. This has got to be the worst airport. Waiting on the tarmac for an hour both ways is preposterous.",-1
2022-05-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,1,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,Time to improve DCA authorities!,False,"  I live in Alexandria, VA. I do not travel very often but I made a trip to Tampa, FL. this past Memorial weekend. My review or complaint is about the public restrooms service in DCA, small spaces, uncleaned, sinks clogged, broken faucets, no refilled soap dispensers, no coat/purse hooks, in resume a restroom service failure. DCA is the capital airport! What a shame! When I was in Tampa Airport waiting for my flight back to DC, I used the restroom, it was almost impeccable, also I saw an airport staff with a checking list. Time to improve DCA authorities!",-1
2021-08-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,3,,3.0,1.0,,,,worst run airport in the world,False,  DCA is the worst run airport in the world. Nobody knows what is going on. The gate sign said closed at gate 47. After asking several airport workers the sign came on for gate 47. After 20 minutes the gate was changed to a different city. Do they told me gate 52. At gate 52 it said closed after the announcement on the public address said 52. They told me it is gate 48. At gate 52 they had no sign and told me they were going to another city. Later the sign changed to White Plains. The signed said boarding in 4 minutes. The only problem was the plane was not in. All I can say this is the worst run airport in the world. If you like wild goose chases it is for you.,-1
2019-11-13,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,45 minutes for the bags to arrive,True," 
Quite a bad experience when arriving late. They could not get the jetway to work for perhaps 20 minutes. We just had to stay there in the plane. Then it took 45 minutes for the bags to arrive. It seemed that only one carousel was being used. We had to wait for another flight’s bags to be offloaded first.",-1
2019-03-09,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,There is plenty of seating,True," This review applies to Terminal A. Transited through Reagan National. Its a very busy airport with Southwest, Frontier and Air Canada all operating from this terminal. There are great views of the airfield from the boarding area. There is plenty of seating however at peak times, there can be a dearth of seating. One of the new innovations is the dining area where orders are taken on iPads which have flight info and links to several newspapers and magazines as well as online games. WiFi service is very good and fast. Limited number of shops given size constraints of this terminal. The only thing I wish this terminal had is an airport lounge. However, given the space constraints in Terminal A, I do not see an airport lounger being built here. Overall, a good airport and terminal to transit through.",1
2018-12-01,0.9,Solo Leisure,5,5,,5.0,,,,5.0,left the terminal very fast,True,  We arrived before some minutes 11 p.m. The aircraft stopped in the front terminal. I left the terminal very fast. My checked baggages waited for me. I caught the last Subway to city center.,1
2018-06-12,0.8,Family Leisure,5,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,no lines at any airline desk,False,"  Terminal A at DCA was extremely pleasant to travel through. Since it is based on the oldest terminal of the airport, it has an intimate feel in the check-in areas. I traveled with Air Canada, and in the morning I traveled there were no lines at any airline desk. TSA was smooth, with barely any passengers passing through the checkpoint. The boarding area is nice with a good number of shops, and there are many iPads throughout the terminal, which shows the airport’s effort to keep up with airport across the country in modernizing. For Air Canada from the DC area to Toronto, I think that DCA is the best airport to go through out of the three airports in the area.",1
2018-01-24,0.7,Solo Leisure,3,4,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,there is no common use lounge,True," Nice Airport, especially the landside with a great view on the airside. Nice place to eat at the airside, however there is no common use lounge, what a pity when you are not flying in business class. Ready to pay 40-50 USD to get access to a common lounge and be in a quiet area. Hope the airport authority will be more modern in their decision making.",1
