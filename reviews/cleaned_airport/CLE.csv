2024-07-21,0.5,Business,1,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,"TSA rude, obnoxious, and, slow",False,"   I fly a decent amount for work so I have gone to the TSA in a lot of airports in the USA yet, somehow Cleveland TSA seems to go out of their way to be rude, obnoxious, and, slow. This last time they confused a portable monitor for a tablet and got annoyed at me for their ignorance, and said I had four laptops. I had just one laptop for work and a small tablet. I have been the TSA at BNA, ATL, GSP, ORD, SFO, ONT, MKE, and Monteray (MEX) with the same gear this year without a problem. Yet Cleveland TSA has got to be obnoxious about it. The Airline ground staff at Cleveland has always been amazing, especially with Delta, and United, friendly helpful, and present, in my opinion, they make up for a lot of the facility's shortcomings.",-1
2024-03-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,4.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,problem is poor staffing and planning,False,"  Flew back in December from Hopkins and spent 90 minutes in line for security. Today, 3/3/24, I checked my bags and saw that the line for security was the entire length of the airport! While we were waiting in line, we were offered “CLEAR” for a faster way through security. We never would have made our 10:50am flight, despite arriving at 8am. So, we spent the large sum of money on “CLEAR” to ensure our vacation was not ruined. The people in security used the excuse that traffic was high for spring break. I didn’t see any groups of young people that looked like they were going to a beach. Spring break is still a week or two away! The problem is poor staffing and planning. I use to fly twice a week through Hopkins for 12 years and never experienced the ridiculousness that I experienced in December and again today. This is the age of “It is no one’s fault and no one takes ownership.” Remember when Cleveland was the best location in the nation? Well, the Plum has worms!",-1
2023-06-30,0.1,Business,2,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Dirty disgusting bathrooms,False,"  Cleveland airport is awful. Dirty disgusting bathrooms all the time, trash outside and cigarettes. No pride at all. I’m embarrassed when I have people come here as this is my home.",-1
2023-04-20,0.3,Business,2,2,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,Very user unfriendly,True,"  Parking is inadequate and chaotic, understaffed. Late inbounds flights frequently have no gate crews so you get in late, then wait even longer. Very user unfriendly.",-1
2022-08-15,0.8,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,having to walk great distances,False,  Getting in yesterday was ok except for having to walk great distances when my partner and I have hip issues. Being offered a ride on an electric cart that did not happen. Then today we sat in the check in area for more the an hour waiting for someone to push our wheelchairs to our gate. We were taken to the head of the line only to have to wait. But everyone was very nice.,1
2022-03-24,0.2,Business,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,harassment on every level,True,"  I fly 2-3 times a month throughout the U.S. for work. Every time I go through security at Cleveland is unnecessary slow and some issue with TSA. They are the rudest agents that look for problems and overreact to everything. I fly LAX and ATL frequently with no issues ever. This trip out of Cleveland they wanted to do a full pat down because a coin sized yellow dot came up in my jeans pocket area when I went through the x-ray machine. I asked to check my pockets and go back through and they refused, used intimidation tactics of getting in my face to make me submit to a pat down. I refused and was kicked out. Checked my pocket and a penny had snuck up in crease. You would think professional TSA agents would be able to recognize a coin when they see it and not subject a traveler to be felt up. Other airports wouldn’t have done that. They also wouldn’t allow me to touch my cleared luggage or purse until I submitted to pat down. Complete harassment on every level.",-1
2021-10-23,0.2,Business,1,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,It’s ridiculous,False,  I have been flying again for business and Cleveland Hopkins is the only airport where you can land and sit and wait 20-40 minutes for a gate to open up. It’s ridiculous.,-1
2020-05-15,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,,4.0,1.0,few airports as poorly run,False,"  I travel frequently and have found few airports as poorly run as CLE. I would much prefer to use Canton/Akron but end up using CLE when the deal is just too good to pass up. I flew out this past Saturday and watched a bunch of employees walk around with little idea of how to get a crowd through security while employing some type of social distancing. One woman walked around simply shouting ""6 feet"" and an employee standing in the CLEAR aisle actually argued with a customer about why CLE just wasn't prepared for the crowd that morning. I do not pay for pre-check, but the gentleman in front of me did, and he was irate that there wasn't even a pre-flight aisle open and he was stuck in the same inefficient line with the rest of us. I returned to CLE from Orlando and experienced none of the problems there that I did at Cleveland Hopkins.",-1
2020-03-09,0.4,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,,This is absolutely unacceptable,False,  We waited two hours for our baggage. The entire flight had to wait two hours. This is absolutely unacceptable. We were so excited to land at 11.06pm and be able to get home a little earlier.,-1
2018-10-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,shuttle service so far away,False," Why did they move the shuttle service so far away? In order to get to ticketing or from baggage carousels, you have to go down one escalator, with your bags in tow, then drag them to the next escalator to go up. Then you have a long walk to get to your shuttle! Not convenient for a 66 year old woman who travels alone. Please return the shuttles back down to the arrival area.",1
2018-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,everything is terrible,False," Terrible. Food, people, etc. everything is terrible. Landed here at 6 and didn’t get bags until 9. Security before getting on plane and after. Baggage claim numbers are wrong. Do not come here unless you have no other choice.",-1
2018-07-12,0.4,Couple Leisure,3,2,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,"Inconvenient and frustrating""
",False,"  While going through security check we placed our boarding passes in the bin with our shoes, purse, belt, etc. When the bins came out of the check point our boarding passes were gone. I immediately notified an employee who was working at this particular security clearance gate. He looked around the the scanner and underneath it as well, and told us we would have to get new boarding passes printed at out departure gate. Inconvenient and frustrating, but even worse was the attitude and disrespect this employee displayed. Wondering how they can claim to screen for weapons, etc., yet lose 2 boarding passes before their very eyes?",-1
