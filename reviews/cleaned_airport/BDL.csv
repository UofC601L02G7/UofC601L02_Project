2022-06-21,0.6,Solo Leisure,5,5,3,5,4,3,1.0,3,everything at this airport is very close,True,"  Hartford airport is very small - I arrived 2 hours before my flight because I was coming from Vermont and wanted to allow for traffic, but that was way too early for what was available at the airport. The hall immediately past security has plenty of restaurants to choose from, along with a number of rocking chairs that have a nice view of the apron. The Gates 1-12 concourse also looked like it had been recently renovated and also had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. However, the pre-security areas and the Gates 20-30 concourse were dark and dim, and were unpleasant places to wait. Fortunately, everything at this airport is very close, so if your flight leaves from Gates 20-30 you can wait in the post-security hall and go to your gate at the last moment. Still, it'd be nice if the airport would renovate the Gates 20-30 concourse and the pre-security areas so that it looks as nice as the Gates 1-12 concourse.",1

I got there a bit late for check in and people let me skip the line! So nice. Security was extra careful to check bins so I did not leave anything behind in my rush. My airline pages me to board!",1
2019-02-20,0.8,Solo Leisure,4,5,5,5,3,3,5.0,5,very friendly staff,False,"  Small airport, very friendly staff, not too many food choices but the best for long layovers if you need a place for sleep, plenty of big chairs/couches, comfortable and with outlets for charging electronics.",1
2018-11-30,0.5,Couple Leisure,4,4,2,1,3,2,3.0,4,"Cmon CT, shape up",False,"  The TSA pre check line is not adequately highlighted when coming in to depart. As a result we ended up in the annoying line where you have to remove coats, belts, shoes, laptops everything but tooth fillings. Plus a full body screen, breast area pat down, leg pat down. Really? I have no artificial limbs, no metal knees. Tampa isnâ€™t nearly as annoying. TSA pre check lines are clearly identified from the moment you enter the airport. Cmon CT, shape up.",1
