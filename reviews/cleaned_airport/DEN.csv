2024-08-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,,2.0,Horrible for traveling with disabilities,True,"   Horrible for traveling with disabilities. We had purchased a ticket requiring wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival, we had to wait for assistance, it was not there despite the flight arriving late. A buggy arrived that could not take us to the required terminal. The supervisor was helpful and called for someone, telling us to wait. No one came after 10-16 min. We found out that despite being told to wait, my mom’s name was not on the list of passengers requiring assistance. We then spoke with attendants at the nearby gate. They frantically texted and called as the boarding time for our next flight was looming. Finally someone arrived and stated that she was unable to take us as her shift would end past the time since the terminal was so far away. Fortunately 2 more assistants had arrived with her with wheelchairs (3 people requested assistance). One of them offered to take us. The other guy with the wheelchair left (presumably thinking that we were the only ones needing assistance), so the remaining passengers did not have the help they needed either. The porter that took us to the gate was wonderful, a man from Ethiopia. He ran with my mother in the wheelchair. I had to take the moving sidewalks to keep up with him. We arrived at the gate right as the next flight was boarding. It was extremely stressful. It took over and hour of waiting for assistance, and we narrowly made our connection. I would avoid booking a layover in this airport in the future, unfortunately we’re traveling through again on the way back. Hopefully our experience will be better but I have my doubts.",-1
2024-08-06,0.2,Business,1,2,,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,Baggage service agents are rude,False,"  Flight was delayed for weather, completely understand the need for safety and rerouting for fuel in Salt Lake City, postponing arrival by 3.5 hours, however, waiting another 80 minutes is horrible. Baggage service agents are rude, as if paying customers should just accept being at the airline’s mercy.",-1
2024-05-17,0.1,Business,1,3,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,I'd rather fly through Newark,True," This is not an airport, its extortion scheme for TSA pre. Avoid this airport for business travel unless you don't need to pay employees for travel time (if you do, then pay the bribe to the TSA for pre-check, you'll save money). Arrive two hours ahead of boarding time if you have a rental car. Security has been a complete disaster for years and has only gotten worse. The line now greets you on the sidewalk outside. Once you get through security, you'll need to fight your way through the mob trying to board the trains and continually preventing the train doors from closing (no TSA Pre will save you here). Congratulations, you made it to your terminal where you must now navigate the miles long slalom course of random kiosks, broken conveyors, food lines, other desperate travelers etc. So that you can stand in the next line at customer service, when you inevitably miss your flight, where an airline employee will complain about the airport with you while rebooking you on a later flight. Then sit down, have a coffee and spend the time waiting for your next flight to go post angry reviews that no one will ever read. Denver is not an airport, it is an elaborate scheme to trap you in their building and sell you garbage you wouldn't need if they could actually get you to your airplane, like a normal airport. Seriously, I'd rather fly through Newark, at least they're honest about how poor they are.",-1
2023-11-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,try to avoid this connection for sure,False,"  English is not the first language here? Announcements in English are at the end. Isn't Denver still in the US? Airport seats are low and hard, very uncomfortable, and not enough charging stations. Bathrooms aren't properly stocked and trash is overflowing. A lady was vomiting with the stall door open and a worker walked in and didnt pay any attention. Aren't they supposed to report that? Airport is dreary and you have to walk forever to find food. If there was a reno, they need it again. Looks worse than when I was here 20 years ago. I will try to avoid this connection for sure, oh and my layover is 8 hrs today. Not a good Airport for that!",-1
2023-10-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,"“A terrible, awful, ridiculous airport”",False," A terrible, awful, ridiculous airport. Virtually unmanageable. You’d better have a minimum of two hours to make a connection- anything less and you’ll be running. Food choices lousy, bathrooms disturbing. Tons of ‘construction’, but not a single actual worker. I have been spoiled by the airports in Minneapolis and even Albuquerque. Flew out of LaGuardia in NY, which was pretty fabulous in every way. We will never fly through Denver again, no matter what we would have to do to avoid it. Even LAX is a dream by comparison. They really ought to be ashamed.",-1
2023-10-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,1,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,Where are the restaurants?,False,"  Where are the restaurants? I have an hour and a half between flights, my departure gate is 10 gates from my arrival gate. The closest actual restaurant is 50 gates in the wrong direction and none of the moving sidewalks work. I'm over 70 years old I'm not going to run. My only other choice is not-great-looking vending machine sandwiches at $17. (Several Gates away, the one near my flight is closed at 5:45 p.m.)",-1
2023-10-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,5,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,This place keeps getting worse,False,"  This place keeps getting worse. There is absolutely no point for TSA precheck to take 30 min when there is no line. The general security line was 20 min faster than precheck. The TSA agents are so slow and rude, it’s not like any other airport I’ve ever visited. They made me walk through the scanner 6x, then take off my shoes, then my shawl, then the decided it was a good idea to have me go through the X scanner. This place makes me so angry every time I visit. I saw them swabbing a woman’s leg cast for explosives. Another woman was asked to open her (previously unopened) brand new powdered chai because TSA can concerned about explosive in there.",-1
2023-09-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,5,,5.0,0.0,,,,The concourse shuttles were terrible,True, The concourse shuttles were terrible. I arrived at concourse A and every stop to baggage was 10 minutes. Then luggage did not arrive until over an 1 1/2 hours later. My flight with Southwest Airlines was very good. But I have never had such a bad experience at Denver airport as I did this time.,-1
2023-09-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,waited 1.5 hours for bags on arrival,False,  We waited 1.5 hours for bags on arrival (JetBlue) - other airlines (Frontier) got their bags first even though they arrived later. On departure after the bag drop we joined the security queue which snaked all the way around the airport - we had to walk all the way round after finding out at the start of the queue that it was the right Q ! Then halfway through the queue an airport staff diverted us up escalators and back down to the start of the queue to walk ALL the way round to the Back of the queue again.,-1
2023-09-04,0.2,Business,3,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,disruption due to construction,False,"  Terrible airport.  Restrooms stink. There is no provision for traveler information in the main terminal. Half the elevators we encountered were out of order. Others were blocked by construction. There is so much disruption due to ""construction"" but even on a weekday there seemed to be no hurry to complete the job - no workers in sight. Few restaurants in the main terminal area and those had little or no seating. Outside the restaurants there was even less seating. The arrival sign at the international arrival didn't work. Signs to TSA screening were confusing and misleading, though TSA itself seemed to be efficient. Internal security is a joke - there are few if any visible security officers. When I did find two Denver officers and tried to make them aware of an unattended bag they just grunted and waddled off. Perhaps worst of all, vehicle theft in airport parking is a serious problem and again, there doesn't seem to be any Denver police presence.",-1
2023-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,The airport was dirty,True," The airport was dirty, the boarding agent was late, and said I was lucky that they were helping me because they usually don't. All while charging me for assistance because their Frontier app was glitching and did not send me my boarding pass. This guy was rude and very unprofessional. He acted like I owed him he denied my priority boarding and showed up long after the airplane should have already started boarding.",-1
2023-07-31,0.3,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,by far the worst airport,True,"  I fly frequently for both work and personal travel. Across my personal experience, having gone to many different airports DEN is by far the worst airport. I live in Colorado and it is my main and only location to fly in/out of. There are several reasons I rate DEN this way (1) poor signage to find tram/gate/TSA lines - I always need to coach friends and family who are visiting to both enter and exit the airport. They still inevitably get lost. I even still get lost from time to time! (2) Incredibly long wait lines for TSA entry. I have bio clear and TSA pre check. In all my experiences there has always been a long line and it takes at least 30 minutes to get through. This is on a good day. (3) They have sensitive TSA security machines compared to other airports - my luggage is ocassionally pulled for checking and it never happens at other airports. Like I said, I fly frequently and know what and how to pack to get through fast. Things still get triggered and every time they check my bag they find nothing wrong. (4) Disgusting bathrooms with poor design and cleanliness. No room to keep luggage with you in the stall and everything looks and smells dirty. Please take a note from MSP airport - build in luggage cubbies, make sure stall doors don't have huge gaps, and keep some consistent cleaning schedule. (5) Tram setup and dependence. Gates are all far away and you are essentially dependant on taking trams to get anywhere as it's challenging to walk and navigate. (6) Tram capacity levels are low. In the last 24 hours, I had to wait for the 4th Tram to go through before I could find even slight room to get on. I'm not a large woman - average athletic build - and there was no way for people to fit on the prior three trams as passengers were packed shoulder to shoulder and couldn't move to slightly allow others on. A large group of us started to build up at the tram stop at midnight because there was zero room. Not a great experience when you just want to get home. We tried to walk back but an airport employee told us to just use the tram because construction won't allow us to connect to ride pickup area. (7) Poor restaurant options and quality. Food quality and prices are just bad. Again, comparing to other airports you have both your fast food and sit down areas. We don't go in with high hopes for eating, but we have consistently bad food at sit down restaurants in the airport - fast food is what you would expect in terms of quality. (8) Departure exit escalators are limiting. If you take the tram to the airport departure gates, you are forced to take one of total 4 small escalators to get to the level that brings you to shuttles/ luggage pick up/etc. These escalators always have long lines because there is no other way to get to the departure level without going up the escalators or separate staircase - which is challenging with heavy suitcases. Comments are perpetually made about this poor design and one would think there is a fire hazard risk (this is not my area of expertise so who knows). It's just a miserable experience going from line to get on tram, line to get off tram, and line to get on shuttles. (9) Comfort does not exist. I am typically in the United Hub and ocassionally use the United pass, but regardless of how you choose to wait for your flight, you will be sitting in an area that likely isn't temperature controlled, doesn't have enough seats for full flights and is lacking in outlet plugs. I don't recommend this airport.",-1
2023-07-10,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,it keeps getting worse and worse,False,"  I travel monthly multiple weeks through this airport, it keeps getting worse and worse. Security is a nightmare, unorganized, lines backed up due to not enough gates open, staff are rude and slow. If you plan on getting through DIA better plan for at least 4 hours. This morning the regular lines were backed up, yet TSA pre check area empty and the Security agent said pay 85.00 and you can get through this. Is that the point? To start forcing everyone to pay for pre check? Why not open this line and get past the back log. I have metal in my body so need to go through the body scanner, yet it wasn’t available for the regular checks forcing me to go all the way to the x-ray and have to be escorted over to the other machine. Would it not have been more effective to just have this open? If I had a choice I would avoid this airport like the plaque. DIA get it together please.",-1
2023-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,rude staff and lack of service,False,  Denver Airport is a joke. So is the rude staff and lack of service. I hate this place and will avoid it at all costs from now on. I will get a connection flight anywhere else but here and if I do come back to Denver I'll drive and avoid this headache and joke of an Airport.,-1
2023-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,security line extended so far,False," This is the worst airport I’ve ever traveled through. The standard security line extended so far that if you could find the end, you wouldn’t be able to see people in line ahead of you that couldn’t themselves see the screening area. Their website said 23 minutes but it was more like 1 1/2 hours. Inexcusable.",-1
2023-06-19,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,,Really bad airport,True,"  Really bad airport. Bathrooms are unsanitary, trains are overcrowded, most escalators are broken, and it takes at least 45 mins for bags to arrive at baggage claim.",-1
2023-06-02,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no benches to sit on while you wait for your bag,True,"  There are no benches to sit on while you wait for your bags. Seems like a simple thing. Elderly and disabled persons waiting 30 or more minutes for their bags seems like an ADA violation. The signs for the baggage claim escalators were so high up, I didn't see them.",-1
2023-05-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,Worst airport ever,False,"  Worst airport ever. I was sent to different areas for security tsa check in. Line was maybe 30 people but took a half hour. Confusing contradictory instructions. Overall a terrible airport design and incompetence among tsa people. it is the worst airport I have ever been in and will never , I mean never originate a flight out of there again. I said that the last time a year ago and mean it this time. The place just is a confusing mess. No water or vending machines in the baggage area. Little help from staff there. Nothing like Ohare or other major airports.",-1
2023-05-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,Security lines hours long,False,  Worst airport ever. Security lines hours long while two other security areas were closed. Nobody that works there cares. Tons of TSA idiots standing around trying to act tough but I’m no way helping. It’s almost if they try to make people miss their flights at this airport. Try opening up all the security areas instead of having the lines wrap through baggage claim. Whoever runs this airport needs to figure it out cause it’s the worst run airport by far.,-1
2023-05-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,Denver is truly the worst,False,"  I have travelled all around the world and through countless international airports, and Denver is truly the worst. I've had the misfortune to have Denver as my home airport for several years now, and it is grossly inefficient, poorly designed, ugly, and difficult to get around. The employees at this airport act as if they either do not care about their jobs AT ALL or yell at travelers as if to make full use of the small amount of power they have. Security lines here are also beyond ridiculous, with lines frequently running out of the main security hall and down the hallway. It is the only airport that I have ever had to wait over an hour for security at, and this has happened five or more times. I am even a Clear member, and have had to wait over half an hour in that line multiple times as well. The airport has also been undergoing seemingly endless renovations for years now and each time I return it looks even further from being finished. The walking time to gates is absurdly long, with some gates taking as much as 20 minutes to reach from the main terminal areas. The decent wifi is really the only positive thing I have to say about this place. Again, I travel internationally throughout the year and have seen many airports, none of which are as inefficient and unhelpful as Denver. I am not typically one to write reviews, but I am fed up with this airport and feel a need to warn others of the frustration and waiting that they will inevitably encounter at DEN.",-1
2023-04-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,"Disturbing, disgusting and horrible",True,"  I arrived at the airport and they were supposed to be two ladies needing wheelchair assistant. One person showed up. When we finally got to where we're supposed to be at, we were in the wrong place. When we finally found out where we're supposed to go, they started working with us. When the guy noticed where I have to go. He was not happy, that he had to basically go across the whole entire terminal. He was very slow, he was complaining but he got me where I needed to go so I can fly out. That was a solo part. I flew back two days later with my husband. And we were both handicap assistant that we needed. My husband is low vision and he has to walk with a cane, I am also hearing impaired so a lot of noise can get very confusing to me. When we arrived the man at the counter helped us told us where we need to go. Another man showed up with my name on a piece of paper and a wheelchair. My husband told me to get in the wheelchair. He'll just travel behind him. Once that man found out where we had to go all the way across the terminal again, he was complaining. To the point where he kept saying I don't work and that area I only work in terminal areas. Can you walk? He kept getting a little louder and ruder. I was trying to figure out what he was saying after a while him complaining cuz he kept getting closer to my head what he was saying and I finally said you know what I'll get up. I'll walk, and when I got up I quickly got dizzy and realized. Nope, I got to sit. And he still kept complaining that this is not his type of job. Once I asked my husband. Can you please explain to him what's going on? I'm having a hard time understanding him, that's when he shut up. I live here in Colorado. I am ashamed that this is our airport. Airport. Disturbing, disgusting and horrible. I would never recommend anybody to fly into DIA. You need to train your employees to shut up. Be respectful and if they don't like their job quit their job and go to another one. I feel sorry for anybody who's got to travel there and have to do a handicap assistant cuz I would never recommend it. If the Loveland/ fort Collin airport can fly people out, I will be using them more often. They're more respectful.",-1
2023-04-26,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Incompetence at its worst,False," This is the single WORST airport I’ve EVER been to! For being the 3rd largest airport in the world having the same security for ALL airlines is absolutely ridiculous! Most large airport have security at the terminal that you’re flying out of. The construction has been going on for years and they’re not even fixing that part! They’re just moving security up a level - it’s dirty, I mean filthy, bathrooms are atrocious! Security lines are unacceptable, I’m talking winding all the way outside! The train is the ONLY way to get to the terminals. The little train they fills up instantly and you have to wait train after train until you can get on! Then when the train breaks down, you miss your flight. That’s it. How can you not have another or a viable option to get passengers to their flights? Incompetence at its worst. Avoid Denver at all costs.",-1
2023-04-22,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airport by far,False," I cannot find the words to express how your airport is the worst airport by far that I have travelled in over 50 years of travel throughout the world, including the 3rd world. Much of it is because the TSA are unable to figure out the resources needed to allow passengers to get through without having to stand in line for 2 hours or more. All of the airport management and staff should be utterly ashamed of yourselves. Also, who designed your airport, an insane madman? A clown chimpanzee could do better. Up an escalator only to go down another escalator and then walk all the way around the airport back almost to where we entered to find where the security line starts. Couldn’t someone have directed us to the beginning of the security line? I had to leave litter because no one thought to leave trash bins anywhere or provide cups of water to people passing out in line. How many people have stood in line only to miss their flight. How many people has all this saved over 20 years? You wouldn’t even let me have a drink of water after getting though security parched. You took it off me before I could have a drink. How in God’s name does that help? Oh and can’t you figure out a way to test an old man’s belt without having to take it off and have his trousers fall down in front of everyone. Where is your sense dummies? I am 62 and I can see no alternative but to say I am disabled in order to get assistance and avoid standing in a TSA line that winds all the way around your horrible airport. Absolutely terrible, I can barely walk now I am home. Zero IQ Clowns.",-1
2023-04-01,0.8,Business,4,3,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,Very nostalgic airport to me,False,"  Very nostalgic airport to me. Easy to get to baggage and train. On the way home on a Sunday, long security line but it moved fast. I dropped my hat and people passed it back to me! Terminal felt congested. Better food on concourses. Love the red eyed blue horse statue.",1
2023-01-23,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Most inefficient airport,False,"  Most inefficient airport in the country. I fly out of here all the time, and it gets worse everyone I come. Poorly staffed, long security lines, not enough parking, no good, healthy food options in the terminal. Feeling increasingly like a third-world airport descending into chaos.",-1
2023-01-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,the most incompetent airport I've ever been to,True," This is the most incompetent airport I've ever been to. If you can avoid departing from Denver, or scheduling a connecting flight through Denver, do it at all costs! Our gates were changed 10+ times and delayed by several hours. I'm still here and worry I'll never escape. Psychically hostile walkways create a sense of unendingly escalating chaos. You are an ant when you are in Denver and the petulant automated text alert systems that notify you of flight rescheduling are your queen. There are no human beings here. Anyone you complain to will be powerless to help or even alter the course of your journey and your inevitable negative emotional reactions to your circumstances will be carefully channelled into the pedestrian collider/retail corridor. We hate you, human. Welcome to Denver International Airport.",-1
2022-11-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,there were no signs to check-in,False,  Worst airport ever and I have traveled extensively worldwide. At the drop off there were no signs to check-in. For all of terminal A there were only two fast food restaurants and little or no place to sit. Horrible. One star.,-1
2022-10-22,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,airport is why people fly private jets,False," This airport is awful, just like the city it serves. No pride always broken. Parking is a nightmare. Passenger transportation is horrible. This airport is why people fly private jets. The management here has turned a first class facility into a turd. They must never fly out of here.",-1
2022-10-21,0.7,Couple Leisure,4,4,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,thank you for your help and understanding,True,"  We flew into Denver for a lay over. My husband got sick and had to go to the ER. After some very unhelpful people and getting the gate doors shut on us for a flight home we were put on standby for the next flight the same day. Mind you we were on standby because they said we missed our flight. We did not! We were told to come back at 6 and they would be able to see if we were on standby still. After explaining our situation and I was upset about it. A supervisor Eric and a one of your employees LauraBeth were very helpful and got us on the flight. Sadly we did not get to California but made it home and it was because of those 2 employees. Non of the other employees were helpful. This was my very first flight. I am over 40 and was anxious enough and then having my husband in the er and then being told we ""missed"" our first flight and being put on standby. I was a mess. I just wanted to get back. Again thank you Eric and Laura Beth for your help and understanding.",1
2022-10-17,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,I’m sad I have to use this airport,False,  This is my third time going to this airport in a month. Fix the signage and please make it clear. The departure line was past the baggage claim. At least have someone flag the people who will be late for their flights. Baggage claim and passenger pickup is the worst. Leave four hours before hand when going on a domestic flight. I fly around the world and I’m sad I have to use this airport.,-1
2022-10-17,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,line was at least 150 people long,False,"  My husband went through regular security and beat me (thru TSA Pre) to the gate.  I followed a sign down an escalator that had a TSA Pre arrow. At the bottom, the line was at least 150 people long. After more than 10 minutes an agent came walking down the line saying “this line is for TSA & CLEAR - you must have both.” (Mind you there was not the word CLEAR anywhere so far.) She directed me out into the luggage claim area where the TSA line wrapped around at least 3 carousels. When I finally got to the roped off lines in the actual TSA area, the first line I was in AND the TSA Pre line came together and broke off into their own lines. Is DEN really not prepared for this many people every day? My husband, on the other had, gives his experience an A+. 3rd in line on the upper level security and comfortably sitting at our gate when I arrived sweaty & frazzled!",-1

2022-10-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,security lines get longer and slower,False,"  I have lived in Colorado for 17 years and DIA persistently gets worse. The security lines get longer and slower, the A Line to the airport is less predictable, and the staff are negligent. It's been under construction for over half a decade with no end in sight. Every flight I've taken in the past three years has been canceled or delayed. I wish there were at least a few positive things to say about the airport but I honestly can't think of any. It's poorly run, poorly staffed, and is always disorganized. The City of Denver or some other authority should get involved to replace DIA's leadership. DIA is an embarrassment to Denver and the state of Colorado.",-1
2022-10-11,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Avoid this airport at all cost,True," We don’t have any choice. We have to fly out of Denver. If we did, we’d avoid this airport at all costs. You’ll need at least three hours to get to your plane. Last time we flew out, even the clear and TSA lines are too long. It took me over 45 minutes to get through TSA. Then the trains were packed. On our way out, we had to wait for a 3rd train. On our way home, the train was down for 7 minutes which backed everything up. The platform was so crowded, people coming down the escalators had no where to go. So dangerous. Each train that stopped was already so full, only three or four people could squeeze in to each train car. Avoid this airport at all costs.",-1
2022-09-27,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,2,3.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,,Worst airport experience ever,True,"  Worst airport experience ever. Complete madness, the gate locations are really difficult to find. It was so crowded and nowhere did the gate number indicate a different level and then board the train. They need to have much better ways of directing one to their gate.

Since I travel so much I have tsa precheck and clear. I have no idea how anyone would travel out of here with only one or neither because they are always so short staffed. The security is like a bottleneck causing many passengers to run through the airport and miss flights. Regardless of the day or time the security is always running on a crabby skeleton crew with less than half of the lines open even at north security. They just added a ton of gates in the C terminal so there are even more passengers waiting at security. The new part of the C terminal is nice but there are no restaurants yet. The older part of the airport is definitely run down and dirty with few restaurant options. Everything else would be tolerable if they would just invest in improving the security checkpoints.,-1

Overflowing trash receptacles with paper towel. Unflushed toilets. Dampness in the air.  Gate A32 had mice and they appeared to make themselves at home. The food, on the floor, dropped near the garbage can will always attract mice. Dirty carpeting from multiple, untreated spills. Overall, a very disheartening experience. I will try not to fly out of this airport ever again.",-1
2022-07-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,2.0,the most confusing airport,True,"  After going through an enormous queue to security screening, I began to load the baskets with my items. Only then did a staff member come by and say that people with ""metal in them"" should use another line. This should be posted and people informed much earlier. Additionally, this was the most confusing airport I have ever been in, very poorly designed.",-1
2022-06-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,absolute worst designed airport,True,"  This has got to be the absolute worst designed airport I have ever been in and Ive traveled all over the United States as well as Europe. Never have I been so confused as to the layout and how to find anything. You have signs with arrows going every direction saying all Gates and then north security, south security, arrows going up down left right East terminal etc none of the signage is clear or obvious. I had to ask a security person who was equally unclear and vague and could hardly speak english. After going through the 85 minute long security line which started all the way at the beginning of baggage claim, wrapped around all baggage claim areas ( blocking people) into another area where you had to walk past the skinny little dividing wall with barely enough room for people to roll their carry-ons, people trying to get their luggage had to cut through the line. The serpentine line literally filled up the entire floor of the bottom portion of the airport. Once you got dumped out after walking through the screening machine they were yelling at you to get out of the way get out of the way while you're trying to put your shoes on your jacket on get your purse etc. And then there was no arrow no clear direction which way to go where to go it was the skinniest narrow pathway having to step over fans and obstacles all in the way to go into an area that's not obvious what that area is. Having never been to this airport before I was unaware of the passenger trains that take you from terminal to terminal. Once I realized that was the deal I figured that out. The lights were out on some of the gate signage signs so it wasn't clear which direction to go once I was dumped out at the appropriate terminal. And to make matters worse as I stood in line to board the airplane for Southwest the signage at the front telling you which row and which boarding group you were in was broken it kept flip-flopping back and forth so nobody had a clue which line they were to stand in or whose turn it was to get in line. Once on the plane I thought was home free but no the pilot seemed to be lost when he was on the tarmac he went all the way to one runway then did a u-turn and it seemed as if we were going in circles maybe there was a change in the wind direction and that was necessary but seems sort of odd that you wouldn't know which way to go.",-1
2022-06-12,0.2,Family Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Very disappointed,False,"  Very disappointed. Went to eat at the sandwich/ice cream shop by gate B54 on the United B concourse and we saw one of the employees prepping food with her disposable gloves on, the problem was she was touching her mouth eating food while prepping the food. This is a serious health violation. I was shocked! I asked to talk to the manager, in which I did, but he didn’t seem to concerned! Very disgusting! After seeing that we decided to go eat somewhere nicer. So we chose Elways. The food wasn’t bad but the problem was the lady bussing the tables, thought it was ok to use the same bar towel for multiple tables and if that wasn’t bad enough, she was wiping the seats off before wiping the tables! Terrible. Also the bathrooms I went into were disgusting!",-1

2022-06-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,This airport is absolutely disgusting,True," This airport is absolutely disgusting. The gate where my first flight was dropped off (in the B80s) looked straight out of the 1920s. No monitors to check, musty and smelly, barely any space to move. I had to walk to about B40 to see a monitor to check my connecting flight. Even in the ""nicer"" parts of the airport, there is absolutely no space. Tiny hallways with excessive crowding. It is near impossible to get through with so many people going in different directions. Good luck finding a table to eat at, or anywhere to sit for that matter. The bathrooms everywhere are absolutely atrocious. Stalls with no locks, doors don't shut, poop and toilet paper everywhere, empty toilet paper rolls and empty paper towel dispensers. Every time I went into a restroom there was someone in there ""cleaning"" it, but toilet paper and paper towels continued to be empty and I never saw them actually clean or sanitize anything.",-1
2022-05-28,0.1,Business,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,add some more restaurants please!,False,  Absolutely worst airport for number of eating establishments.

2022-05-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,1.0,,,,,Total chaos and incompetence,True,"  I hate incompetence, always have. I try not to complain but this experience was too much. I returned from London through Denver International Airport (DIA) - one of the most modern airports in the USA. Total chaos and incompetence. This was my 4th international arrival this year but my very first ever at DIA. I pity passengers having to deal with this mess in the future. It was horrible; a mess of chaos, poor design, and execution. If this is a preview of summer travel, God help the travelers. We landed on a United flight from London Heathrow. United scheduled my connecting flight for about 90 minutes, which should have been enough time to make the connection. We even landed early. The trouble started shortly after leaving the plane. There were two escalators going to the next level. At the top of the escalator everyone was funneled into a small doorway (wide enough for two people) in a very small area leading into a massive corridor. There was a logjam at the top of the escalators; people could not move forward but the escalator kept bringing people up. I had one foot of space between the escalator and the person ahead of me. I was pushed into the back of the person ahead of me, quite forcibly by the guy behind me. Pretty soon more passengers were banging into others, some ladies fell, and other passengers tried to keep new arrivals from falling. Very dangerous, unnecessary safety breach. We made it through the doorway to be in a corridor with probably well over 1,000 people milling about. (I later learned that 12 international flights landed in about a 45 minute period). The line abreast was about 20+ people and 200 yards long ahead of me, pretty much at a standstill. We moved slowly toward some unknown destination. At the end of this mess was one entry point that could handle a few (2-3) people at the same time. Passengers were jostling to get into the entry. We then noticed this entryway was for a serpentine maze of about 30 twists and turns. Looking behind me I saw the crowds getting bigger. After 20 minutes I came to the end of this queue. Get this - it led to one exit staffed by one (1) Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officer. OHer sole function was to look at your passport cover and point you right (US passport) or left (foreign passports). Seriously. How stupid. Despite numerous signs telling passengers to have their passports ready, many passengers didn't. Instead of telling them to step aside, the agent patiently waited for them to go through their luggage to find it. A second agent stopped by for a minute and then left. Why not have signs way, way back in the corridor to avoid this? I took the escalators down to another massive queue. More waiting. Finally interviewed by a CBP officer. This didn't take long. Claimed my bag, rechecked it, and then wondered into another abyss. We had to go through TSA security again. I have PreCheck - I saw signs for it but not for the entrance. People were looking everywhere for the entrance. I ended up having to backtrack 100 feet to find a not so obvious sign. Six people ahead of me. None, again, none of them had PreCheck but were just as lost. The agent was in good humor when I made it to him - his comment was something like ""Wow, an actual PreCheck passenger!"" I think poor signage had a lot to do with it. I made it to my gate just as the plane was boarding. What a mess!",-1

We stood in line for a security check for 4 hours with two of 8 security checks open on a weekday! One lady sent us (and at least 2,000 other customers) to the wrong check line, refused to give us directions to the correct security check. For being an international airport who’s capable of checking thousands of national and international customers a day.",-1
2022-04-07,0.5,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,1.0,,,,3.0,The airport is a mess,False,"  The airport is a mess. Unless you fly weekly, you must plan your arrival and departure well. We departed downtown Denver using the morning RTD train from Union Station. It was fine. Discharged from the RTD train to take a huge steep escalator (if not working use the Westin elevators), to the cold open air Westin plaza and into the main terminal to catch the robo shuttle to terminals A, B or C. You better know which one you want. Got off at terminal B to be greeted by a huge network of TSA security cordons. Where is airline baggage check-in? Asked a TSA Agent nice enough to point us the directions- down the hall, up an elevator to the UAL counters. Checked baggage in, then around the counters, down an escalator, and back to the madness of the security lines. Everyone in a mad rush. Take your time and stay calm. Airport lacking signage. I have been in big domestic and intl. airports without Denver Intl.'s problems. Be prepared.",-1
2022-04-03,0.2,Family Leisure,3,5,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,Absolutely worst airport ever,False,"  Absolutely worst airport ever. Rental car returns has a missing sign, you wouldn’t know a turn unless you user iPhone. Then comes the next part. Signage for security check is confusing beyond belief. Who can tell the difference between bridge security vs open security check? There’s an additional line for TSA pre check. Half the moving walkways don’t work, basically have a to walk.",-1
2022-03-26,0.1,Family Leisure,1,5,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,most confusing layout,True," Where do I start? There were no bins available going through security. Departing Denver at 5:40am -I don't know whether they didn't want to be there, maybe it was to early. She (TSA agent) walked right past us with a pallet full of bins. She wasn't moving because she was talking/laughing and the line in front of me was moving. I told my son to grab a couple bins since we were holding up the lines by not having a bin. Only then did she start moving and wouldn't let him take one. She told him to ""Come get it"" very nastily after she walked past us. I won't even start on us now having to walk all the way to the other side of the airport. It's confusing. No one was there to make sure we were even going in the right direction. No signs. There's no way this is a ""requirement by the FAA"" to have the most confusing layout I've ever seen. I've lived in 2 countries and traveled to most US states. I don't leave reviews on airports normally, but I live in Denver and I'm sad that I do. I've never had these experiences anywhere but here. I would leave 0 stars if I could. I've had it with this place.",-1
2022-03-14,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,"it's mass confusion, with absolutely zero signage",False,"  This airport used to be at least a decent experience but has turned into a circus. The moment you walk in it's mass confusion, with absolutely zero signage or directions of any use. Hopefully you enjoy wandering around and didn't try to bring too much carry on to lug with you, because asking for help from some of the staff is a Russian roulette of what type of attitude you're going to get. I'd be more sympathetic, but I've also worked long hours interacting with the public, and there's no reason to be abrasive so long as people are being polite. TSA was the most pleasant part, and that's because they kept any interaction to a minimum so that the line could keep moving.",-1

2021-11-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,have never seen such rude behavior out of law enforcement,True," Police officers outside extremely rude. Several people in line outside waiting on family to get to vehicle and told to leave. The police were having lots of fights with people in Arrivals line telling them to move and shining their flash light in their faces or into the windshield of cars making it hard to see to drive off. My children were literally walking out the door and the police officer told me to move now, I told him my kids are right there, he said no move now, go back around. I had to circle around 4 times to get my kids because they wouldn't allow you to stop more than 2 minutes. I was stopped a total of 8 minutes and told move now and was yelled at. Several people treated the same way. I use the airport 15 times a year every year and have never seen such rude behavior out of law enforcement. Worst experience ever would not recommend using again to anyone. Searching for a new airport to fly out of all year.",-1
2021-11-24,0.5,Business,1,4,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,What a complete disappointment,False,"  They manage to mess up TSA preapproval. Previously had two locations so that it was convenient based on which airline you used. Now they have, and they use the word consolidated, so there is only one TSA location so instead of having 50% roughly of the customers who are TSA pre approved going to each location you are forced to go to one location therefore there is literally no time advantage. Took about 30 minutes, so absurd. The only remaining advantage of course is you don't have to take your shoes off. What a complete disappointment, big government gone wrong. I don't care what the rationale is, fix it.",-1

This problem needs to be fixed. Why do they have everyone go through the same TSA lines? Unlike other airports that have their own TSA for a specific terminal or even airlines! Awful experience,-1
2021-10-29,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,the worst airport I have ever used,False,"  Absolutely the worst airport I have ever used. It's not just this flight it's my last 3 flights out of Denver. TSA is incompetent. I stood in line for 20 mins at that and was told to walk to the south check point, walked down stood there for 10 mins and was told to go to another check point. 1 hr 30 mins total to get through just TSA. Missed my flight by 10 min, I will never use this airport again.",-1
2021-10-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,4,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,Very poor and confusing signage,False,"  I have been to many large and small airports across the US and international airports. Denver airport joins Paris Airport as one of the worst. Very poor and confusing signage. Long long hikes especially to retrieve luggage and no options for assistance for those with walking difficulty. (I have MS making long walks difficult). Many of the escalators and walking sidewalks were closed. Inadequate seating at gates. No tables and limited seating after security to gather items, put on belts etc. I would say the single worst point about Denver airport is the confusing or lack of adequate signage.",-1
2021-10-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Overpriced parking,False,"  Overpriced parking, $145 for 24 hour garage. Construction for over a year, a mess as you can not walk through to even get to the restrooms. The absolute rudest people are at this airport. I am not sure what it is, as I travel a lot. From the ticket agents that are either screaming about electronic check in, or at the check in desk. The American Airlines agents are the worst! To the screaming TSA agents, who are always yelling something, shoes on, shoes off, in the bin, out of the bin. The only thing good I can say is that the airport is clean.",-1
2021-09-25,0.1,Business,1,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,ongoing construction project that never ends,True,"  I have always enjoyed Denver International Airport. Perhaps not the fanciest, but reasonable, navigable, and manageable. The last two+ years however have been pure travel hell.  This ongoing construction project that never ends is a nightmare. Still no food in the main concourse. Still a disaster area ever where you turn. This place should qualify as a blight and get disaster funding. When does this nightmare end Denver?  Outlying parking lots are still closed because they have no drivers. The crowded trains that run on the strangest schedules. Never enough, always loaded to over-capacity.  The ridiculous security lines. Enough said. Ridiculous and unacceptable. Just ridiculous. Closed bathrooms. Don't pass one if you see one. All the broken floor tiles around the baggage areas. I am sure the ground moved, but really this is our airport? Every trip through there is another experience in ""worst airport ever"". So sad.",-1
2021-09-21,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,an absolute nightmare,True," I rarely write a review, and then only if it's positive. Denver International, however, is the exception. Almost everything about this place is bad. TSA check in is an absolute nightmare. TSA precheck line had maybe 500 people. Non-precheck had 2 lines with maybe 1000 people each. Everything is dirty. Especially the bathrooms. The airport has the feel of a Soviet-era prison without all the glitz. Sure, most airports today aren't fun. Weird TSA security layouts, understaffing, closed facilities. It's just the way things are. Denver takes it to another level. For example, the rental car facilities are dirty and understaffed. I waited almost an hour and a half in a rental car pickup line before I cancelled the car, walked out, and took Uber to Colorado Springs. The on-site gas station was unbelievably filthy with trash spilled all over the ground. If you're arriving on an international flight and have bags, you have to collect the bags and transfer them. This process is standard. At Denver though, you have to collect your bags, take them upstairs and outside to a curbside pickup, then return inside and downstairs to go through security. I might be able to overlook all this if the airport weren't in Colorado and 30 miles from downtown Denver. If you get stuck at DIA, you're spending a lot of time and money finding a hotel or a new wait out of the state. It's just not worth it. Play it safe and use SLC, Vegas, or Phoenix. If you're in Colorado, enjoy the breath of fresh air that is Colorado Springs Airport. You've been warned.",-1

Several of them hadn't flushed, paper towels all over. The entire airport smells of urine. There is a place for dogs to pee and poop, but no easy access to outside to smoke. The people who work here are rude and not helpful at all. I will never fly from or to Denver ever again.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,I had nothing to drink for several hours,False,"  This airport should just shut down. I was there for an extended layover and I thought I was in the twilight zone! I had nothing to drink for several hours, not allowed to bring beverages through security, and nothing was open for purchase! Not one place. There were no drinking fountains either, so I had no choice but to drink the warm water out of the bathroom sink. The airport was very difficult to navigate as there were no signs giving any directions! Construction everywhere I looked, escalator out of service, I walked so much that my feet were swollen! When I got lost, I couldn't locate any help, except for one employee who shooed me away when I started asking him a question. Terrible customer service! Every worker that I came into contact with was flat out rude. That's unacceptable, especially because I am a very kind person. I suggest you visit another airport and take notes. I will do everything in my power to avoid Denver International Airport.",-1
2021-08-03,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Worst airport in the country,True," Worst airport in the country. I’ve lived here in Colorado over 30 years. Loved Stapleton but realized we needed a larger airport to accommodate the influx of new people to the area. DIA was built not long ago but super short-sighted as it has never operated efficiently for travelers. For many years, it’s been under construction causing delays/obstructions and it seems no one can figure out what to do to fix the many problems with this newly built antiquated airport. If you’re building a billion $ hotel here - it can be erected quickly. I’m a frequent traveler and am planning to move from Denver Metro area so I never need to travel to DIA again! I'm writing this while on the train to Union Station, which was closed with little notice when I was heading to DIA a few years ago.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst airport in the country,False,"  Worst airport in the country. Trying to figure out where to go after arriving, forget it. There is no one to ask and no signage. I ended up jumping to a completely different terminal and my ride couldn't find me. No idea how it happened, I just walked down the concourse towards baggage claim then hopped on a train. Then departing, so much construction is going on security cannot be found. The escalators are unsafe, too steep. No decent food is available after 9. The place is filthy. No charging stations work in the terminal seats.",-1
2021-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,the worst airport we have ever been to,False,"  This is the worst airport we have ever been to. Construction in check in area, escalators being worked on, longest walks we have ever experienced, not to mention the longest lines and the worst TSA security check point service we have ever had in our 50 plus years of traveling! I wish I would have gotten the name of the awful woman who ‘frisked’ me and 3 members of my family. Really? I think she should be fired. All in all we were thrilled to get out of there and will never book a flight that takes off from Denver International. Shame on you for treating people the way we were treated today!",-1
2021-07-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,DIA never fails to disappoint,True," DIA never fails to disappoint. TSA has always been the worst at DIA. Then there is always some type of construction. I typically brace myself and 'deal with it'. But yesterday the pre check on north security was closed and there was a full line waiting for regular check. I raced to the south side. TSA pre check had 3 lines and the clear queue funneled to one gentleman. Frazzled I held up my pass and he gave me the 'lady put it on the scanner look'. At least he apologized when I complained about booking a terminal length to go through his line on the south. Finally through TSA and down the stairs to very backed up and broken train the terminals. After three trains I was able to get one to the C gates. I charged to the gate with a few minutes to get some water for my asthma which was now flaring up from all the people, the humidity in the terminal and my perspiration soaked mask. I asked where the water was to fill my bottle and was told it was 30 gates away back in the center. I did not want to risk missing boarding so I went to vending and found one machine half empty with only pepsi and mt dew. No water. In desperation I got a pepsi. Then I went to the restroom - the stall floors were littered, soap dispensers empty. The germiest place on earth is a bathroom and without soap or even hand sanitizer I cannot follow covid protocol. Disgusting and contrary to the mask mandate. Understood and even flexible that Covid has taken its toll on everyone but the lack of signs, supervisors, and basic needs is unacceptable. I recommend more supervisors on weekends and make sure they are visible and available - it is season! Prioritize cleanliness of restrooms and provide clean drinking water.",-1
2021-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,TSA experience was terrible,False,"  The Denver TSA experience was terrible. Every person had to stand next to another person and walk about 50 ft while a dog was put on them to sniff for whatever. It was demeaning and reminded me of the scene from Shindlers list. This was a clear effort to control and abuse passengers, not for security purposes. Dogs are discretely used in airports, no problem. This was control by an abusive government. I have called my congressman about this issue. Arrival at the baggage area, no vending for water. It was over 100 degrees out. Nobody to help, no information booth. I had to ask airline employees for information. I will never fly out of Denver again and would only use it for a connection. It is a terrible airport. The giant TSA screening area is a stockyard not fit for humans. What a disaster.",-1
2021-07-05,0.4,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,This airport is very very understaffed,True," Denver had only McDonalds (gross) open during our delay. There were no food kiosks available due to short staffing that could be coin or card operated. No phone charger docks via vending either. Would have been very helpful. Plenty of chair charging docks-but if you don’t have a cord you’re screwed. Also why can’t airports have designated sleeping areas other than the scant cushions that only the lucky find? Sleeping on the floor-great. I did like the frequency of the gate train to get you to A, B, C gates. $14 for a turkey sandwich and $23 for a charger cord. Weather delays are real money makers for the airport concessioners. Thanks and happy Fourth of July. Not. The next day I had to walk up and down the B corridor twice just to spot the signage for Gate A to get to the train. My ankle still hurts from all the walking I did. There was no one at the information booth to help place a call for a hotel or car. The security guy told me to jump the 3 block line at customer service. Yeah right buddy. This airport is very very understaffed and as per usual overpriced. Gate B 3-9 area was beautifully designed with open glass walls and glass cathedral ceilings. Great great pod seating, comfortable chairs that support you when you put your head back. The music was also good throughout the terminal. Too bad the rest of the airport seemed like an older and uglier version of somewhere else. Bravo for this slice of heaven.",-1

Cleaning staff standing around people watching and not once did they try and clean a table and sanitize tables. We have just gone through a pandemic is no surprise to anyone, airport should be ashamed of their staff and lack of care for people using airport. Denver airport charges outrages prices for food but cannot provide a clean and safe environment for its patrons. Good service manager should be placed on probation. Location is a pandemic waiting to resurge. Avoid this airport at all cost.",-1
2021-06-15,0.1,Business,2,3,,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,Departure was a nightmare,False,"  Arrival is okay although you have to look for the hidden boards indicating assigned baggage carousel. We walked the length of the baggage claim area and looked at each carousel before finding ours. Departure was a nightmare. Priority check in was slower than regular. Other customers had to help us with self-check in. We followed signs to North security only to find out that the TSA line was closed and we were redirected to South Security. There were no signs how to get to south security. We had to ask 3 separate people and ended up in baggage claim again. We finally found a police officer who gave us proper directions. After finding south security I set off the walk thru alarm, went back through and was then selected for a random search, they swabbed my hands and the test indicated positive which required a more than thorough patdown. The agent pulled open my waistband, pulled up my shirt, all in front of the crowd. The TSA agent told me hand lotion sometimes gives a false test. Seriously!? Perhaps we need a better test or this was just BS. I was humiliated during the whole process. There is no way a reasonably intelligent person can navigate this airport due to their poor signage. This was my second bad experience - my first made me miss my flight due to poor signage. Never again. I suggest you fly into Colorado Springs and drive to Denver before using this airport. Also, all food options had lines so long you would miss your flight.",-1

Xpress Check also owns airport spa but must have made more money switching to covid testing. $200 for test or miss flight or quarantine. The management was intimidating the customers, would not allow customers to ask questions and literally yelled at customers who appeared frustrated. Manager did not distance when she became angry. Several people who questioned her missed their flights. Disgraceful service.",1

There are zero Amenities in the main terminal. Security is slow, airline counters are jammed, directional signs are awful. In the concourses all the amenities are clustered in the central area and are all jammed with long lines and not enough seating. Gates do not have enough seating and most electrical outlets don’t work. Every time I fly through here I have to help lost people figure out how to get on the train to the terminal to baggage claim. This is literally one of the worst airports now.",-1

It was such a pleasure going to Denver Airport and leaving. We would recommend them at any time.,1
2021-05-03,0.4,Solo Leisure,4,1,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,,I was appalled to see how filthy the terminal seats are,True," I arrived for an early morning flight to New Orleans and naturally sought out a seat as soon as I arrived at my gate. I was appalled to see how filthy the terminal seats are - disturbing at any time, much less during a pandemic. The seats (I was in terminal A) had visible sweat streaks on the backs and seats, stains of various colors (brown, gray) from unknown, organic substances (some trailing down the back of the seat), and overall just looked completely unsanitary to sit in. I did not visit the restrooms, but would imagine that if they get regular service, the toilet seats are less bacteria- and germ-ridden than the terminal seats, which appear never to be cleaned. Shame on Denver Airport for disregarding passenger safety during a global pandemic by not cleaning these. I had to break out my own disinfecting wipe to clean the seat before using it. Shameful.",-1

We are used to getting blizzards even. The snow stopped at 10 pm, 3/15/2021. It is now 11 am on 03/15/2021 and they still haven't got the snow removed. That is pathetic. You had trucks out all night. Many trucks working 24 hours. I feel bad for those workers on the snow team. They either need more help or more equipment. It should not take this long to get it back and running in Colorado out of all places. We should be used to snow.",-1

Thank goodness for the unaccompanied minors room. Workers like this should be valued and appreciated.,1
2021-02-06,0.7,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,Denver Airport security was molasses slow,True," This airport has the most inefficient TSA security check process I have ever experienced. I've been to many other airports and their security often makes you feel rushed they are moving you through so quickly and efficiently. Denver Airport security was molasses slow. Lots of standing around waiting for your bin to enter the scan device and then waiting again on the other side of the body scan for your bin to complete its scan. So slow! After I went through the whole process I saw 2 main items that would help speed up the process at Denver Airport: 1) Automated return of security bins. Security checkpoints at other airports have automated bin returns which really speed things up. At the faster airports there is a worker feeding them into an automated bin return and they are quickly made available at the start of the line. Denver Airport had workers using very inefficient carts with bad mobility. My daughter and I couldn't help chuckling at a worker that was slowly navigating a cart with a stack of bins bumping into doors and other items as she struggled to slowly steer the cart from the end of the line back to the start. 2) Have travelers separate out items into different bins with no layers for security scan. Security checkpoints at other airports have you place your electronics in separate bins with now layer/piling of items on top of each other. For example, in Seattle they have you remove your laptop(s) from your bag. Same for your cell phone and bags of liquids. At Denver Airport they had everyone place everything in one tray each all piled on top of each other. Goo grief! No wonder the guy looking at the scanner had to stare at the screen for ages! It took forever. Extremely inefficient and slow for no good reason. Whomever is in charge of security at Denver Airport should take a trip to some other airports and pick up some efficiency improvement ideas. It would go a long way in getting travelers through their security area more quickly. The would also likely need fewer security stations, less equipment and fewer security workers. Aside from the slowness and inefficiency at security, the rest of the experience was fine. There was some construction, but it didn't disrupt our ability to get from point A to point B.",1
2021-01-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,3,,1.0,0.0,,,,DIA is a monstrosity,False,"  I’m a long-time traveler, having been to all 50 states, elite status on most airlines, and traveled to or through a lot of US airports. DIA is a monstrosity. Arriving, it took forever to find a way to get to baggage claim - I walked the terminal over taking the train as suggested to avoid crowds but there were no easy ways to get back down to baggage claim, eventually took an elevator. The RDA train to the city is super convenient, but the escalator to get down to it had a closed sign blocking it with no alt offered - eventually found an elevator to take me down. Departing was a nightmare. Getting off train, no easy signs for where check in is, but it dumps you at United, which had lines out the wazoo for everything. Security was snaked for miles and miles. I would hate this airport in particular if I was flying United - on what should be a light day of travel, long lines for everything, most not distanced. I actually had to stop and look up where Southwest check in was on my phone - never have I been unable to navigate an airport based on signage alone. TSA was a nightmare. The north security has shorter lines but I, like many others in front of me, had bags pulled for extra screening. I waited an additional 20 minutes for this check, bunched together with others. They had to check the pockets of my backpack, which were filled with coins and other random junk and has passed through TSA screening at least 10 times with everything in it with no extra search needed. I then darted off to the train to get to the gate and, not being familiar and with no signing, I accidentally got off at the A gates because A51 was prominently called out on my boarding pass - but actually gate was C42, that was just my boarding position. Absolutely no signage or announcement about airlines are at what terminals and every terminal looks exactly the same. I barely made the flight - I was the last passenger on. I hate this airport - it’s massive, confusing, and crowded.",-1

2020-11-20,0.3,Family Leisure,3,4,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,,I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport!,True," In the season that we are in (COVID-19 Pandemic) I am very pleased to see how airlines and airports are keeping travelers safe and enforcing safety measures. On November 19, 2020 my nephew and I flew from BWI-DEN to connect to DEN-EUG to visit my son on United Airlines. Upon arrival at Denver International Airport, I was shocked to see so many travelers not practicing social distancing. It looked like a regular day at the airport pre-COVID where no one was practicing social distancing. There were lines at the eatery, Smash Burger in particular, where there were no social distancing guidelines and the patrons did not take it upon themselves to do such. What was more distressing was that at the sitting area at the gates there was no signage as to be 6ft apart or the seats with the signage to be 6ft apart. Some travelers did not have their mask on or did not have their mask on properly - meaning over mouth and nose. It did not look like security was reminding people to social distance. There was even one man strolling through the airport with the mask in his hand swinging it back and forth. CDC and other health officials have warned about traveling safely during the holidays. I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport! While at this point I do not know if Colorado has mandated strong COVID prevention practices, I will say I was surprised that travelers were not taking precautions. Please note that until there is a way to slow down the infection rate of COVID-19, I will not be going to or transferring planes in Denver, CO. Stay informed. Wear a mask. Be safe.",-1

2020-03-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,This is an airport I will purposely avoid,False,"  Arrived 5 min early. Went thru security in 3 min with global entry then waited over 1 hr for bag. I had priority service as a close connection. United 3 staff at 11.30 am were lazy, terrible, and not assisting at the baggage carousel. The one agent ripped my tag off my bag, said run to your gate and from there on a nightmare. No assistance. The bags were to be on carousel 3 from Costa Rica then 2. Japan Airlines arrived 15 min after us and bags were off loaded. Shame on United Airlines. Went thru tsa again as international security and tsa not the same in Denver. No direct connections for international passengers transiting thru. Waste of money and intelligence really. Tsa agent took my 100 ml Jam as they don’t understand its less than 3 ounces. World uses metric, come on Denver, get educated. I gave it up. Tsa agent dished me from the tsa line as one of my boarding passes said tsa approved and the other didn’t have the stamp. So, sent me to the end of the other line. She knew I had 15 min. Another volunteer staff, assisted me and brought me thru to the front of the line. Those who have nexus, global entry should already be pre tsa approved. This is an airport I will purposely avoid. I ran past 50 gates, no assistance from tsa or United and missed the flight by 5 min. Went to the United assistance and explained what happened. The very seasoned agent, said, she knows the system here is awful and gave me a ticket on the next flight. Rating 1/10. Very poor.",-1

But the system was down, and I asked some customer service help, but their response was too rude to hear. I was in line for more than one and a half hours that made me late. So, I bought another new ticket (United Airline). I want to recommend all employees should be trained well, especially their mouth and eye, as well as they should know what their job is. They should not look down the customer/guest as a terrible enemy and a valueless animal. If possible, that airport should be avoided.",-1

Wheel chairs were available, but no directions on how to acquire one, and no visible interest in assisting older or infirm people. Denver friendliness is a real issue. I have been through the airport several time times this past year, 2019, and have found many of the service employees are never available. I strongly recommend that if you can change planes somewhere else, try to do that.",-1
2019-10-31,0.2,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,Dirty and dingy feeling,True," Dirty and dingy feeling. Nasty smelling. Signage horribly placed and sometimes misleading - worst I've ever seen in an airport, I think. The wonderful light rail station shouldn't be hard to find, but this airport makes it hard to find. The baggage carousels take inordinately long to deliver the luggage. Unclean restrooms. Disgusting seats from the moment you check in with your airline to the moment you leave your gate. Gruff and mannerless TSA agents, even by TSA standards (then again, it is Colorado, which is arguably one of the U.S.' least friendly states). Even TSA Pre-Check passengers wait longer than in Pre-Check lines in other airports, I can also attest to how terrible the lines at DIA are for non-Pre-Check holders. Boring and unoriginal options for snacks, dining and drinks for such a large airport. At least the inter-terminal tram is clean, efficient and dependable, and, as I said, that light rail station is such a nice asset. Friends don't let friends fly in and out of Denver, y'all. I've never liked this airport, but my most recent experience really did me in with it.",-1

I understand things can go wrong but today, all of the following happened: 1) Escalator stopped when going down. Small girl was thrown to the ground and was hurt. 2) Got on train to go to baggage - did not go anywhere. After 10 minutes - we had to walk to baggage claim. 3) Waiting for baggage - when it finally started to come out- it got stuck and took someone 10 minutes to fix. Get your act together.",-1
2019-10-19,0.3,Business,1,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,train the officers to be better,True,"  Unfortunately, I encountered traffic on the way to the Denver Airport to catch my departure flight home. I got there later than desired, but was still going to make my flight. However, as I was going through the Tsa screening (I had my stuff on the belt, next in line to go through security), my lane and a handful of others stopped operating. This was around 5:00pm on 10/18/2019 The TSA officers made no attempt to explain to the people in line what was going on. Instead, the officers in my lane kept laughing and cracking jokes about ""the supervisors not doing their job"". They should be more sensitive and considerate of all the anxious people waiting to get to their flights. One guest in the lane next to mine remarked that his plane was leaving soon and he might miss his flight, to which the officer sarcastically replied, ""That's unfortunate."" without even giving the guest a glance. Another guests 2 kids had passed through the security gate right before the machines stopped, so he approached the officer after about 10 min and asked if the kids could come back through to stand in line with the parents so they wouldn't be waiting alone. The same officer mentioned above replied in an aggressive manner that ""they've been randomly selected and they'll be selected again when they come back in."" What he's saying is not wrong. It's how he said it that rubbed me, and undoubtedly the father, the wrong way. You could tell the father was annoyed because he simply didn't want his kids to be alone. My negative experience was mainly due to 1 or 2 officers, but there is obviously a work culture that tolerates this kind of behavior. There were other officers around that said nothing to correct the abovementioned officer's rude behavior. I have traveled a lot in my life, and can deal with a bit of rudeness, but this was over the top. Please, train the officers to be better people, which in turn will make them better employees. The Denver Airport processes many, many people each day, and bad employee behavior should not be an impediment.",-1
2019-10-18,0.2,Business,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,looks like it’s been through a demolition,False,"  I have travelled in Denver over 15 times per month on average (since this airport was built). It’s the worst run airport I have been through. Escalators are broken consistently (perhaps 1/5 trips I make), bulbs are out in the elevators, and to make matters worse the major construction to shift security upstairs (complete remodel) has come to a halt. The contractors were recently terminated. Currently the terminal looks like it’s been through a demolition. On a good note the train that runs from Denver works well. On a bad note even the long term parking is expensive ($18 per day) and the shuttle buses run infrequently. This airport is run by the city of Denver.",-1
2019-10-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Why do the folks from Colorado tolerate this!,True," Terrible experience! First, getting thru security was a nightmare because a screener was being trained. They discussed every bag! No attempt was made or any consideration given to travelers missing their flight. Second, no gate information is available until you get to terminal a, b, or c. So that is not helpful when United flies out of more than one terminal. I had to take a second train ride. Third, I had to use terminal b. It has 95 gates! And guess which gates are at the end? Local flights. What a way to treat guests coming to spend money in this state. Why the taxpayers put up with that I will never know. I don’t understand how voters put up with that. Last, United treats their customers like crap with broken down planes, gate changes, delays, outrageously bad customer service. Why do the folks from Colorado tolerate this!",-1
2019-10-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,4,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,utterly bad experience,True," I am a frequent traveller and familiar with quite harsh airport proceedings. But what happend in Denver Airport is inacceptable. Arriving at the security checkup with a broken arm in a cast and therefore quite handicapped I was treated in an extremely impolite and despiteous manner. The security officer shouted impatiently at me to move my luggage myself on the moving floor, his female colleague barked at me in bad slang with a ferocious face and pushed roughly around without any explanation when she was controlling me. When I was through they had much fun controlling my husband in the same rude and extensive manner, impeding him purposedly to help me collect my items. We gave no comment to them to avoid things getting even worse. This was an utterly bad experience, I felt rather like a head of cattle than a like human being. The behavior of such incompetent staff is a shame for Denver and is by no way worthy of an International Airport, but gave us the impression of a deepest ignorant and uneducated province.",-1
2019-09-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,signage was confusing and incomplete,True," I took the light rail from Union Station to the Denver Airport on 9/3/19 for a flight to Salt Lake City at 2.25pm. This was the worst experience I have ever had at an airport in all my travels. There is ongoing construction going on at this airport and this construction probably has a lot to do with my horrible experience. Trying to get from the point where the light rail ended at the airport to finally arriving at my departure gate was a pretty bad experience. The signage was confusing and incomplete while navigating around all the construction. The route to my gate was circuitous and aggravating. I had to stop and ask for help more than once. One employee apologized for all the craziness - she said the original company that was contracted for the construction work was ""fired"", and the city is now back to the drawing board finding a new company to do the job. This experience has left me with a bad taste, and until that airport construction is done, I would suggest you avoid flying out of Denver airport.",-1
2019-09-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,"When possible, I'll avoid Denver",False,"  I found Denver Airport very difficult for travelers to use and I recommend anyone who has to use it to leave lots of extra time and be prepared to be frustrated and treated rudely. The signs are poorly placed, when they exist. On arrival, finding the rental car shuttles was very badly marked. When I had finally gotten my car - the rental car offices are several miles away - and returned to the airport to pick up my daughter, one of the traffic officials was very unpleasant. There were no other cars in the row I was in or the next row, which were both permitted lanes for picking up passengers. There was room for easily 20 cars. I was typing in the address we were going to into Google Maps, and he came over to insist I leave. We had been there for less than 3 minutes. On departure, we had to walk a very long distance to the gate. If you have any mobility problems, request a wheelchair. Security was very badly run. There were 3 lanes open, but only 2 staff to check boarding passes and IDs. The middle staff member made no attempt to be sure that the left two lanes alternated, and no one bothered to change the lanes to two lanes. When I mentioned the problem to him, he said it was the travelers' fault that they weren't alternating because they were stepping up too fast. The lines at the food counters and in the convenience stores were very long because it is a very busy airport. The staff at the food counters and convenience stores were very nice and helpful. But don't count on having time to get food between flights. When possible, I'll avoid Denver.",-1

Under construction. The screening process is a zoo. Only comparable to maybe Atlanta. The TSA people are rude. The amount of walking you have to do is crazy.

They only had 3 agents working all US and Canadian citizens and two working the rest.

Our departure experience is why I'm reviewing this airport. We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare because I knew from previous experience how long and time consuming security can be there. The first thing we did was stop at the rest room right by security. The people in front of us in line informed me there wasn't any toilet paper in the stalls. I was hoping they were misinformed but they were correct. There was no toilet paper. There was a woman with a TSA vest on in the restroom. Someone in the restroom asked her if she could let someone know there wasn't any toilet paper and she blankly looked at her and walked away. I was very surprised to see the security line wasn't very long! My 18 month old son has special needs. He has a feeding pump and has Cerebral Palsy therefore he is unable to stand or sit on his own. The TSA agent wanted our stroller to go through the conveyor belt machine. I told the agent I'd rather push it through so I would have someplace to set down my son while I gathered our things after they came through the belt. (I knew I'd have to hold my son but wanted to be able to set him down afterwards) She said no. She then took off all 3 of the stroller wheels and crammed it down so it fit through the machine. My son and I walked through where we were supposed to be and waited for our things. I had a backpack, laptop, my sons diaper bag, my sons feeding pump, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and my stroller without wheels to get after it went through the conveyor belt. So I'm standing there holding my son, who I can't set down anywhere wondering how I'm going to get all of this stuff back where it needs to be. Eventually I asked one of the TSA agents if they were going to put my stroller back together. I got a blank look and he went back to what he was doing. I then loudly said ""Someone better get over here and put my stroller back together"" and an agent put my stroller back together so I could set my son down and get all of our stuff. The staff I encountered during my time at Denver airport were not helpful. I originally flew from Minneapolis to Denver a week earlier and had zero trouble going through security. The staff at MSP was all very helpful and understanding. They let me push my stroller through so I could have someplace to set my son down. They helped me gather my things. And they were also busier than Denver was at the time.",-1
2019-07-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim,False,"  The strange experience started when our inbound flight from Frankfurt had to approach from the South and was sent many miles past the airport to turn for final approach, delaying our arrival. An extremely long level flight at minimum altitude followed before we reached the glidepath. Taxiing to the terminal was delayed again due to ""traffic"" - we stood on the taxiway for aeons with engines running. Entering the arrival concourse we found a long walk to the end of a huge crowd of arriving passengers queueing for so-called immigration. Coming from an efficient home airport we were overwhelmed. Even families with small children had to stand. If you had to go to the bathroom - forget it. We arrived at a few self-check machines where we had to type in lots of info plus give fingerprints and face photo. A slip was issued and we were so naive to think that was it - like at other airports in the world, and only customs would follow. No way. There was another queue (sort of like what cattle go thru at the slaughterhouse), even slower. When we were at the front, to our surprise, we got to an unfriendly (we had know they are from many previous US visits) inspector who did not bother to speak loud and clear. He wanted all the info the machine had asked just before, plus fingerprints, this time including the thumbs. We had the impression foreign tourists are a burden in this country. The baggage had long been removed from the delivery belt and put aside. The whole procedure took 100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim. The signage that should lead us to the TSA checkpoint was poor. TSA - long lines, we got to the front a bit faster as we were business class. The whole checkpoint was a complete zoo. Due to the new full body scan you had to remove the complete contents of your pockets, handkie, notepaper everything. Then the train ride - more or less swift. The departure gate was not friendly and inviting, not enough seating and poor shops. The airline refused to let us wait in the first class lounge as we were not members. Thanks goodness here in Europe you can use the lounges if you go business.",-1
2019-06-30,0.1,Business,1,4,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,this airport leaves a lot to be desired,False,"  Like the previous reviews, this airport leaves a lot to be desired. My biggest frustration is the train that runs between terminals. At night the airport decides to run the trains on a significantly reduced schedule regardless of how many passengers are waiting for it. I’ve seen 20 minutes between trains, with the waiting area so packed that only half of the people can board the 1st train, so they have to wait another 20 minutes. The folks in charge of the measily savings this provides should be immediately terminated for their complete disregard for customer service.",-1
2019-06-22,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,mile-long security line,False," This airport is a giant heap of disorganized garbage. There should be a sign or some sort of notice that if you accidentally take the train to baggage claim instead of the gates, then you will be forced to go through the mile-long security line again. Ask an employee where to find something and they'll send you to a wrong area where someone will yell at you and act like you're an idiot for not knowing this place inside and out on your first visit. Our flight was canceled and there was no comfortable place for my daughter or I to lay down and rest there during our 25 hours (every hotel and motel was booked solid). Horrible layout, inefficient service, and incompetent employees. Will never ever fly into or out of this airport again - Colorado Springs is worth the extra money.",-1

It is a zoo, flight delays are not uncommon, TSA is in absolutely no rush ever and baggage is the slowest of all the airports I have traveled in the past two years even when your flight is hours late arriving. It is sad and there is really no excuse with the taxes we pay.",-1

We had a layover in Denver that became an overnight stay due to weather. I am reviewing the handicap stall in the bathroom by the United Airlines terminal. My daughter uses a wheelchair and had no room to enter stall and close door. If I was not there she would of had to leave the door open. The airport needs to address the stall. Also there should be an additional stall as one is inadequate.,-1
2019-06-03,0.4,Business,3,1,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,restrooms are the dirtiest,False,  I travel to Denver airport at least every three months: the restrooms throughout the airport are the dirtiest and have the most malfunctioning toilets I have ever run across in my travels to other airports. It is consistent- there is no excuse.,1
2019-05-26,0.8,Family Leisure,3,4,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,We loved the cleanliness,False,"  We loved the cleanliness, really fun stuff, modernized design, was a lot of natural light with the large windows, lots of cool shops (they were actually quite cheap) and amazing restaurants, construction was noisy, trash on gate seats (not the airports fault)",1

2019-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,,4.0,1.0,disgraceful lack of customer service,True," I’m still sitting here in this airport shaking and in tears waiting for my flight, after being treated like a jail inmate by the TSA staff. I am flying urgently to see my daughter who has been taken into hospital so I was already feeling anxious. The guy who checks passports was sat in his chair, morbidly obese, yelling at people in the line (it was 5.30am so not busy). Leaving people totally flustured. The lady standing by the scanners gave me a humiliating telling off for simply saying “excuse me, do I need to take my boots off for the scanner?”. Apparently I was “interrupting her”. A disgraceful lack of customer service and professionalism. I’m terrified to come back to this airport again.",-1
2019-03-14,0.2,Family Leisure,3,1,1.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,1.0,experience so gross,False," I do not remember flying into Denver and the experience be so gross! The bathrooms, the floors, the chairs! I don't know what happened, but Denver cut back on expenses and it shows through their hiring! The staff that works there are, I'm sorry to say, but the same customer service level as McDonald's! Maybe if they paid better, they would receive higher standards of employees. I watched a woman cleaning the floor with a dust pan bucket and broom, leisurley passing trash and picking up just some as my 8 month old b-lined it for old food, cups, etc. on a 5 hour layover. The bathrooms reminded me of truck stops, and the chairs smelled of - God only knows. They had holes and tears and rips across them as if the whole airport is falling apart and they are unable to afford maintenance. I will connect through Salt Lake City from now on. The train system works well, and the restaurants seemed fine.",-1
2019-02-24,0.1,Business,1,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,awful experience,False,"  Horrible experience at Denver airport. I’m going to avoid going to Denver at all costs after this awful experience! I’m in the third trimester of my pregnancy and had the absolute worst experience. I got to the airport about an hour and a half before my flight departed and I found an extremely long line that you would have thought there was still a govt shutdown. This was on both sides of the airport. I was really worried about missing my flight after seeing the line but more importantly about waiting too long in line given my pregnancy, but the TSA person assisting on the line told me it would be no more than 20 mins. It took over an hour to go through and when I asked agents to assist me given my late pregnancy state, they kept telling me there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait in line. I missed my flight after having to run through the airport and had to deal with hyper ventilation at the closed gate where my flight was departing from. What a nightmare of an experience! Are these people human beings! Do they have any empathy?",-1
2019-02-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,TSA acting like demi-gods,False," My wife and I live in the Denver area so we are forced to use this airport, we both have TSA PreCheck. I'd highly recommend getting here at least 3 hours before your flight, even if it is at 6AM. This last time we had a 6AM flight and when we got to PreCheck we were treated as normal flyers, had to remove belts, shoes, glasses, hearing aids, empty pockets of everything. TSA agents acting like demi-gods, screaming and yelling. We travel internationally and have never experienced the ineptitude, rudeness and callousness of such people in other countries. Wife and I have decided to drive to Vancouver next time we travel overseas.",-1
2019-02-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,1.0,,,,2.0,avoid this airport in the future,False,"  I will pay extra to avoid this airport in the future, international and domestic. Arrived on a packed flight from Frankfurt, Germany. Passengers were limited to the use of two computers for mandatory self processing (scan passport, take your photo, declaration questions...) at the first check point. I heard an agent say this was to slow down people getting to the next backed up line at the customs counter. An efficient agent should have announced those needing to make a connecting flight have priority, and then got them to the front of both lines. The customs backlog created bags lying around baggage claim. Self absorbed and rude staff in that area were too busy talking with coworkers to answer my desperate need for directions; a body scanner was down when I finally reached the congested security check point for my next flight. A lot of staff standing around instead of reloading needed trays. Never saw one cart and driver, so had to run to final destination. Again, an efficient manager could have projected the need to have carts and drivers available to assist those of us trying to make connecting flights. Yes, signage is lacking or poorly done; yes, too many staff are without basic customer service skills, lack creative problem solving skills, and take no initiative. Denver airport needs an intervention.",-1
2019-01-23,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,Mass confusion,False, Mass confusion in airport because of weather delays. Staff not handling situations well. Many plugs not working.

My luggage was misrouted, multiple staff gave me bad advice and misdirected me, I had to run from gate 38 to 13, then missed a flight because I didn’t have time to get there.",-1
2018-11-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Absolutely dreadful,False," I agree with all the reviews below. Absolutely dreadful! It is hard to bring me to tears but this airport did it. The frustration of signage, untrained staff, security issues. I left my coat as I was helping an elderly man with his cane. To go back to where I left it, South security, took over an hour to find anything with the signage. My arrival a week before was confusing. Baggage signs, go upstairs? Who has baggage upstairs? Which terminal, East or West? I got asked that for 2 pickups and nowhere does it say East or West. The hotel transport lady finally asked what color signs I as looking at. Nowhere does it say you will be taking a train to baggage. I went on an escalator and was by myself in a small highway. Apparently this was a train waiting area with no one there and no signs. Scary to say the least. Go to level 5 which turns into level 6 and after you take 2 elevators, an escalator and a moving walkway you might find a gate that also has 3-4 flights out of one gate and they are all leaving within the hour. I too, will never go near the Denver airport. I thought I might like living in Denver but this sent me running.",-1
2018-10-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,absolutely appalled at Denver,False,"  
I’m absolutely appalled at Denver and United Airlines as we were 2 hours late for our connecting flight and had a 7 hour delay. By the time we got to our final destination one of my bags was missing a wheel as my suitcase had been thrown onto the carousel to board the plane and my wheel snapped off. My other bag had no handle left on it and the lock was missing. And to add to that these were brand new bags.",-1
2018-08-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,poor signage and service,False, Extremely poor experience. We arrived at 12:30am to return our rental car. The signage was very poor. We drove around for 30 minutes or more until we could find our rental server. Then we waited until the American desk opened. The person who took our luggage said to proceed to our gate in the A terminal. There was no available security area opened. The sign on the west side said it was closed and to proceed to the opposite terminal. We walked over to the east side and that wasn’t open either however there were approximately 20 TSA agents behind the glass. Another passenger walked by and said we needed to go to the South security. I understand renovations are occurring but that was extremely poor signage and service. I won’t fly through Denver ever again.,-1
2018-08-11,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,Very frustrating experience,True, Our flight from Frankfurt Germany to Denver Colorado arrived 30 minutes late. We had a connecting flight one and a half hours later. Despite having that time frame we missed our next flight due to no organization to help transfer either by travellers who have been delayed by no fault of their own. It took us over an hour to get through passport controls and security checking. For instance there could have been organization for a quicker line for travellers with boarding passes for next flights within the next 1-2 hours. Very frustrating experience.,-1

2018-05-23,0.1,Business,1,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,Mean customer service,True, Exit the new train. No escalator to check in desks. Take slowest elevators on Earth. Walk past 40 Southwest desks (the entire East wing) to get to Delta. Check in. Go downstairs. No TSA operating today on West wing. Walk back across both West and East wings. Go through TSA meaning walking back the entire length of East Wing. And then get on trains. Whoever designed this concept could only have worked for a demented government agency. Mean customer service too. But grade of F just for design. Seeing kids eating meals sitting on the ground at the gates was the final straw.,-1
2018-05-07,0.9,Solo Leisure,5,5,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,4.0,Absolutely no complaints,True," Arrival from Reno, very easy and quickly out to car rental. Departure was to ZRH via IAD. Check-in staff very helpful and security (TSA Pre) surprisingly quick, although from the number of barriers I suspect that it can get very busy. Very easy to transit between terminals and actually a bright and breezy airport, nice views across the runway. Absolutely no complaints - now about United Airlines, that is a different story (!) but nothing to detriment the good airport experience.",1
2018-05-06,0.2,Business,3,1,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,could not find any comfy chairs,False,"  Well to start, flights were cancelled to DFW due to weather so had to sleep at airport if you can call it that, AA did not offer any voucher for hotel since our flight was 5 am the next day. We could not find any comfy chairs. Those AP chairs are so uncomfortable and armless, good luck in terminal A. Admirals Club only open during the day and not at night, food court left a lot to be desired at Terminal A. They should update the seating and put rockers in like Charlotte. Even places to sleep overnight with sofas and TVs. Very large lot of walking from Main Building to flight Terminals. I felt like John McClain running down the walking sidewalks. Not laid out well and nowhere quiet to sleep. Could not wait to get out of Denver. Only 2 TSA entrances so come early, very crowded. Restrooms were nasty and unclean. Saw no one in cleaning them.",-1
2018-05-05,0.4,Business,1,3,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,always very painful,False,"  I fly regularly into DEN on international flight (Lufthansa and British Airways). I must sadly say that arriving into Denver international airport on international flights is always very painful, literally a 3rd world experience. Coming off the plane, passengers are herded into narrow hallways and escalators. The first waiting line for the automated immigration desks often takes 30 to 40 minutes. Then, to everyone’s surprise there is a second, long queue downstairs, that also often take 20 to 30 minutes. Luggage takes forever to reach the carousels. I would suggest that the management of the DIA airport travels to Singapore or Doha, Dubai or Bangkok to see how it is done. Colorado deserves better at its first International Gateway.",-1
2018-05-03,0.1,Business,1,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,I had 1 hour to make my gate,False,"  Denver TSA is the biggest racket of hustlers this side of the Mississippi. “We reserve 2-4 hours to complete this process” was my excuse as to why it took them 1.2 hours to move us thru. Coming in on a connecting international flight I unfortunately don’t have 2-4 hours. I had 1 hour to make my gate. No checked bags, traveling solo, passes pre printed it doesn’t matter. It’s as if they have mud in their shoes and are under the influence of something other than compassion and customer service. Nothing will come of this review, I just suggest trying any possible way to not go to the Denver airport aka DIA. I personally will pay double for any ticket to fly non stop from my hometown. Unfortunately that was not an option on this flight. Congratulations TSA! You are the worst customer service I can think of.",-1
2017-11-04,0.1,Business,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,wasted frivolous frisking,False,"  The TSA at the Denver checkpoint to terminal A has raised the bar on incompetency. I arrived at the airport in plenty of time ""I thought"" to catch my 8:05 a flight this morning but after waiting 20 minutes to only go 12 feet I knew it was going to be a frustrating experience. When I finally got to the scan machine the poor gentlemen in front of me underwent a search that a referee would surely call ""illegal use of the hands"". I did not get out unscathed either - I got held up by Deputy Dog and he proceeded to frisk my right pant leg and my neck. After that he scanned my cashews and pistachios as they must have looked threatening. Therefore, the worst airport experience for me by far goes to DIA. Moreover, as others have reiterated in this thread the real threats are not likely to be detected with all the time wasted on frivolous frisking.",-1
2017-08-18,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,well done Denver,False,"  Brilliant airport! Easy booking in with BA then easy walk to security. We had access to the priority line and were through in about 15 minutes. A bit disorganised but speedy. The high point was once through security a brief walk down stairs to the train to take us to our departure gate (via the Admiral's lounge or is it Admirals'?). We were not forced to meander through a shopping mall of cheap booze, perfume and cigarettes - well done Denver an example to just about every other airport in the World I think! Boarding was also well handled with well managed queue for First, Business and Economy Class passengers.",1
2017-07-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no food options available,False,"  There are no food options available after 9.30pm except McDonald's and cold prepackaged food. I couldn't even get a beer at the sports pub! When I walked up, he bar tender told me to ""Make it quick!"" Very rude. I left. I tried 3 other places that ""looked"" open and got turned away. After walking back and forth in false pretenses that the next place would be in, I settled for prepackaged hummus and crackers with water. It's pretty pathetic when you can't even get a beer past 9.39pm on a weekend in an International airport! Two thumbs down!",-1
2017-07-02,0.5,Family Leisure,3,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,2.0,TSA is a total joke,False,"  TSA is a total joke. Every other airport I've been to has automatic belts to carry your belongings through the scanners. These idiots make you push everything straight into the scanner and then get in an unorganized line to pass through the x-ray. If you're unaware you need to push your things, they confiscate them. What other airport does this? Have a question for TSA? Good luck getting it answered. They'll just glare at you and move on. They'll let your ""random"" bag selected for extra screening sit for 10 minutes while they stand around talking. I pray to god I never have to deal with this again. Overall the airport wasn't bad, but those staff in security need to figure something out.",-1

The TSA line on a US holiday morning was about ten minutes. The concourses are wide with lots of seating an natural light and a good variety of shops and food. Returning a rental car took time, especially waiting at the gas station near the airport but this is a big airport. It's one of my top US airports along with MSP and Tampa.",1
