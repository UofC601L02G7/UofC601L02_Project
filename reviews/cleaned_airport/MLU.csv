2019-06-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,5,5,5,5,2,1,2,2,there's not many staff,True," I showed up to MLU for my morning flight. I was there in plenty of time and I have flown out of Monroe multiple times. A family in front of me was buying tickets for a flight tomorrow. I waited and waited. Apparently, the woman at the counter, (the only one working) thought I was with the family. Once she realized I wasn't with the family, she tried to get someone to help me but no one was there. I waited long enough to miss the time to check a bag. Finally, a man came to help, but immediately gave me a spill about being on time so I can check my bag next time. I was polite, but I've done this many times. Let's just say the woman working was not happy with him. She tried to help me and I don't think it was her fault that no one was there to help her. I had to wait from 9:40-4:30 to catch the next flight. I guess it is a small airport, so there's not many staff. I think the problem could be prevented.",-1
