2024-02-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,What a mess of an airport,True,"  What a mess of an airport. From TSA to space for waiting and eating. The open airport area may be nice in the spring and fall but is not practical and dangerous during rain, heat and/or colder times. Whoever thought this was a good idea maybe was ok many years ago but it’s not practical nor safe with huddle and bustle and people trying to get between gates and terminal’s quickly in the rain. TSA is also not appropriately spaced and or staffed for the current passenger load. Then, try to grab a bite to eat and you are out of luck with the 1 1/2 hour wait to get in and order food in the 1 very small restaurant. This airport needs a lot of work to safely and comfortably accommodate the passenger load.",1
