2024-08-22,0.4,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"they don't accept cash"" ",False,"   This airport is horrible, they don't accept cash. Read the notes, it's legal tender. What a rotten rule,is this the USA or not. Whoever made these rules is a complete fool. Insensitive elite losers. Many people use cash we don't want to be taken advantage of by these banks and institutions that hate people.",-1

We were able to apply for TSA cares for our autistic family, Tameeka helped us from start to finish of security and was so warm and thoughtful in helping us navigate their first time through! Highly recommend using this service if you have a family member with disabilities. We applied for the same program at Orlando and no one helped us, the staff were rude and the lady guarding the family and disabled line tried to turn us away. Thoroughly disappointed especially compared to Buffalo! We will definitely be flying out of Buffalo in the future!",1

I don’t remember one time that ground crew was ready when the plane arrived.,-1
2023-01-10,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,cannot pay anything with cash,False,"  In Buffalo Airport, you cannot pay anything with cash. So if you don't have a credit card, you cannot buy any food or drink or anything else there (and of course, they take away your drinks at the security check!). This is a nightmare, especially for travellers who don't bring credit cards.",-1
2019-11-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,absolutely atrocious,False," Well I went to pick up my Uncle because he is flying in for Thanksgiving. He was waiting at pillar 7. The person in front of me cut me off, and the person behind me pulled up so tight to me that I couldn’t back up to get out and the parking person or security person who directs you out of the pickup area came over and was absolutely atrocious. Swearing at me repeatedly. I will never fly out of this airport again and my family will never arrive by this airport again.",-1
2018-10-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,Security gave bad information,False,"  Security gave bad information on where to pickup Megabus. This is a chronically late bus service and security knew they weren't giving good info. It's not marked in the bus area. The whole situation is sketchy. I never got to take my trip, lost a lot of time and some money on a chilly morning. Really had it with these people, thanks again for keeping us safe.",-1
2018-10-13,0.5,Business,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,small airport with a simple design,True," This airport is a small airport with a simple design. There are not many shops as well as restaurants. Therefore, there are not many things to do at this airport. The line before the check-in counter of Delta Air Lines was not too crowded.",1
