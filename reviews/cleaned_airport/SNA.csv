2021-05-26,0.1,Business,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,priorities need to be shifted and staff re-examined,True," TSA are extremely rude. To the gentleman in the tsa pre line, learn manners if you’re going to be working with customers or work in the back in a dark room away from people. If I’m asking you something, don’t have attitude when responding. I’m asking to know because I don’t know the answer, sarcasm is not needed. Also out of the 30 airports I’ve been to throughout the world this is the first to tell me my cosmetic items were too large. I think it goes without saying priorities need to be shifted and staff re-examined.",-1

",False,  John Wayne airport is a nice little small/humble airport good for traveling with kids. It is a small airport with only 22 gates everything in the airport is close by. If you live by John Wayne I definitely would recommend!,1

2018-03-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,absolutely rude and unprofessional,True," The staff here are absolutely rude and unprofessional. I arrived in a timely matter and said goodbye to my family and younger siblings who I have not seen in many years and as I walk up to baggage check in, they say I’m a few minutes too late (despite being over half and hour early) and that no exceptions could be made. They made me pay a fee for a new flight and the lady was extremely rude. This is definitely the last time I will ever fly from John Wayne and instead, will just still to LAX where they strive to please their customers.",-1
2018-03-27,0.4,Business,3.0,4.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,laziness and tardiness,True, I landed with wheels down at 12:05 PM. I was the fifth person off the aircraft and it took till 12:50 to get my bag back. That is horrible! This airport is way too small to justify that laziness and tardiness in a frequently visited area. I am a business traveler from Atlanta and Delta has bags up in 20 min at one of the busiest airports. Get it together and build your quality!,-1
