2024-08-30,0.3,Business,3,2,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,not helpful security staff,False, Super arrogant and not helpful security staff. Cannot imagine going through security check not being able to understand english. The staff I encountered was the worst person ever!,-1
2024-08-16,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,"Terrible experience"" ",True,"   Terrible experience at this airport! The labeling of the airport transit system is totally confusing. The train stations are labeled 1,3,4,5. What happened to No. 2? Then there is another station after 5 but not labeled with a name! That’s the station we needed to get to but it looked like it was Station 5! Also the parking lots should have different naming system from the terminals. We parked in G lot. But G is also one of the terminals! When riding the train, we thought we should get off at station 4 where G terminal is but actually we needed to get off at the last station, the one with no name! The design of the naming system is a mess!",-1
2024-08-03,0.9,Couple Leisure,5,3,5.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,5.0,give credit where it was due,False,   We found one particular member of ground staff at the automatic check in extremely helpful & friendly as we were having difficulty using it.. Also for my first time I needed wheelchair assistance ( twisted knee). These staff also were helpful thro security and to the gate. Most customers are quick to complain but slow to compliment so I wanted to give credit where it was due!,1
2024-03-27,0.4,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"lack of cleanliness"" ",False,"   As a lifelong Chicagoan, I was embarrassed at the lack of cleanliness outside the terminals at O'Hare. Please power wash the sidewalks and paint structures. Gum is stuck all over the sidewalk and its filthy. Mayor Daley would never have put up with this!  I wish I had taken photos.",-1
2024-03-27,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,3.0,2.0,,,,1.0,does not justify her behavior,False,  I’m an international student and I had to stop at Chicago airport to get a flight to LAX and my mom was with me. We needed to recheck in our bags and I mistakenly went to the wrong room. Since I was the only one who spoke the language I went to an old lady to ask her where I could recheck in my bags and then she questioned me and started to scream at me and my mom who doesn’t know the language. Then we went back in and checked our bags again. After I left I went to apologize to her and she told me to “go and learn”! Like I get it that I made a mistake but that does not justify her behavior towards me and my mom,-1
2024-03-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,terrible experience transiting,True,"  We had a terrible experience transiting at this so called airport. At security checking we ended up queing twice in the wrong queue because they only informed us as you get nearby the entrance! The time wasted meant we go without washroom breaks and any shopping, else we miss our flight. We arrived at gate B14 and departed at C11, a very long walk. Also need to point out, for some reason the man doing the security checks in our cue was extremely slow at his job, we could hear other passengers also saying “why is this man so slow at his job”. Why was there no supervisor present to notice these inconsistencies. We will be avoiding US airports in future travels.",-1
2024-02-04,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,“Avoid this airport”,False," Avoid this airport, disaster at every opportunity. I understand it’s a very big and busy place but management has their heads so far up their keysters they can’t see the light of day. Make a strategic effort management take a step back and replan, redo and re-execute the entire operation from beginning to end. Give the customer what they need and deserve.",-1
2024-01-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,2.0,“staff not willing to assist”,False," Unable to find an outlet that was functioning to charge my phone, staff not willing to assist, very dirty, multiple gate changes and poorly updated on gate changes.",-1
2023-12-26,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"It was unfriendly, confusing"" ",True,"  My husband and I were traveling home from European vacation. Our flight itinerary included a connection to final flight home (Orlando) through O'Hare. The entire experience was a complete cluster with no clear direction or informative staff. The process for visitors to exit the customs area from international arrivals was embarrassingly long and lacking in clear directions. I was chatting up a baggage handler to get some logistical direction for how to proceed from the customs verification area. The long, long line of people trying to get out of terminal 5 and make their way toward connecting flight terminals or even to exit airport was appalling. There should have been multilingual employees serving as ambassadors to assist passengers who did not speak English well or at all. We had to pick up our luggage and literally re-check it AND go through security protocol all over again as if we had just walked in off the street to begin our journey. We had to interrupt airport staff from personal conversations to ask for direction! We had to ask several times from more than one person who we assumed worked for the airport, which way to get to our terminal (had to move from terminal 5 to 1 to catch connecting flight), which way to TSA pre-check for security, and which line to get in when there appeared to be redundant, contradicting signs. There needs to be some intensive review of the entire customer experience for this airport. It was unfriendly, confusing, and left much to be desired for welcoming international guests. Logisics is #1 need followed by customer service training as #2.",-1
2023-12-13,0.3,Family Leisure,2,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,Confusing and absent signage,False,"  Better than Midway, but that’s an extremely low bar. Confusing and absent signage. Not enough elevators for people with disabilities or strollers. Some staff extremely helpful while others couldn’t care less. This place can be hectic and crowded on any given day, but overall it seems disorganized between check in and baggage. I would say the biggest issue is spread out layout, and need to travel really far to get to one place and then another. Missed more than one flight because elevators were full and people standing around in line blocking walking paths. Needs to be streamlined and simpler. Who designed this corn maze of an airport anyway?",-1
2023-10-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,"shocked by the level of degradation"" ",False,   I didn't use ORD for several years and was completely shocked by the level of degradation. Now it's third world class. I Will try to avoid flying from Chicago in the future.,-1
2023-09-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,1,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,staff refused to help me,False,"  The staff refused to help me find the airport train. She said she didn’t have time for that. Actually make me cry. Reminded me of when I was picking up my mother there years ago, and was yelled at by an employee for pulling up and waiting for her. Who do they think pays their salaries? Get a different job if you can’t be kind!",-1
2023-09-24,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,staff just kept screaming at people,False,"  On our first trip to America we had our layover at Chicago O’Hare both coming and going. When we arrived we were surprised that the queues weren’t as long as we had feared and the man who checked our passports were nice enough. Going through security a woman kept screaming “Step up! Step up!” so we avoided her at all costs. The personnel just kept sighing and seemed really annoyed to have to deal with passengers. On our return flight they were even worse. I wasn’t allowed to accompany my daughter as I had the previous time. She has social anxiety so that wasn’t very pleasant for her. The staff just kept screaming at people what to do and were super rude. I get that this is their job and they do this every day, but most people don’t fly every day and being nicer shouldn’t be that hard. When we had gone through security and arrived at the international terminal we went to buy some water and sandwiches at a self checkout and some guy asked us if we needed a bag. When I said no he said in a super angry tone that he still had to see that my payment went through. I guess we looked like criminals? I went to the bathroom and got looked in. Finally managed to get out. Same thing happened to my daughter later in the day. We had an 11 hour layover and all the seats were really uncomfortable. I hurt all over when we finally got in our plane. (That the guy in front of me had his seat fully reclined the whole 8+ hour flight is another story) We were in Arizona for 10 days and didn’t meet a single rude person in all that time and the personnel at Phoenix Harbor were very pleasant. Extreme difference between the two airports. Doesn’t make me want to ever visit Chicago.",-1
2023-09-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,so many rude staff,False," I thought Pearson airport was bad, but Chicago may be worse! Never met so many rude staff, except for that one gentleman who works for United who assisted us rather than forcing their rules on us. The other staff couldn't care less, the attitude of another was just another level when we had simply asked for directions. Apart from their unprofessionalism, the walk from arrivals is so long. The design of this Airport just sucks. I have no other words, except that this experience definitely deters me from ever visiting Chicago.",-1
2023-09-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"the most unorganized, ridiculous airport",True," I just want to get off my plane. We landed over 40 minutes ago and we are stuck in a holding area. They have sent us to 3 gates already and each one has a plane already in it. This is the most unorganized, ridiculous airport I’ve ever flown in or out of!",-1
2023-09-10,0.2,Business,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,just want to get out of this airport,False,"  So cold, everyone is complaining. Food is terrible but most airports have terrible food now. Seats are very cold and uncomfortable. The air smells bad, I just want to get out of this airport.",-1
2023-08-26,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a perfect example of a failed Airport,False,"  This is truly a perfect example of a failed Airport. Nothing works, staff are rude the wait line for immigration is at times over 2 hours which is totally unacceptable. Voters should immediately take this airport away from Politicians running it to a private enterprise. Shame on you Chicago.",-1
2023-08-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Just the worst airport,True,"  The rudest people on the planet work here. TSA thinks they can treat you poorly simply because of their plastic badge. There are literally signs every 5 feet in the security line telling you that you have to remove anything larger than a cell phone from your bag. When I was attempting to remove my tablet, the TSA employee just kept saying over & over & over...(looking right at me) ""everything stays in your bag"". I politely asked why the sign indicated otherwise, and he just stared at me and said ""everything stays in your bag"". He wouldn't admit the sign states differently. After I finally passed through the metal detector, I got yelled at from another person, who takes her plastic badge very seriously, because I didn't put my bin away. TSA security was nothing but 20 minutes of being yelled at, being told we weren't making straight enough lines, moving too fast, moving too slow & getting ridiculed. They all roll their eyes & look at each other & snicker when someone doesn't do exactly what they think they should be doing. They really need to fix their system instead of getting mad when we can't understand why there are outdated signs. When we got to our gate, the woman working had zero patience for simple questions. We will use Milwaukee next time. Or any other airport not associated with Chicago where everyone hates their job! Just the worst airport. Perhaps they need to understand that a majority of the population doesn't fly on a regular basis. A little compassion & patience can go a long way. It must be exhausting being a TSA employee at O'Hare and being a miserable person every second of every day. I didn't want to give a 1 rating. I wanted to give a zero, but that wasn't an option. Do better, people. O'Hare is an embarrassment to the human race.",-1
2023-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,rudest people I have ever encountered,True, The TSA were the absolute rudest people I have ever encountered in an airport. They confiscated several items and didn’t even give us an opportunity to check them in.,-1
2023-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,3,1,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,airport has never been world class,False,  Better than under Lori Lightfoot when thousands of homeless made this home. However lacks all world class airport charm. This airport has never been world class and never will be. IL politicians are to blame I see third world nations build faster airports than Chicago.,-1
2023-06-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,staff are seriously rude and unprofessional,True," Avoid this airport like the plague if you have a short layover and you want to make it in time for your flight. The lines move slower than a snail and some of the staff are seriously rude and unprofessional. For an airport of this size, it is so poorly organized that newcomers will have to go on a scavenger hunt to find their gate, if it's not already very close by. If your gate is in a different terminal, good luck actually finding it without stopping to ask for directions. I had about twenty minutes to get to my gate before the doors would close, but my flight wasn't listed on any of the departure screens in Terminal 1, so I had to hear it from a staff member that my gate number would be on a departure screen in Terminal 3. Which meant ten minutes wasted traveling by train all the way to Terminal 3, only to find out that the gate itself is actually located in Terminal 2. The icing on the cake was that my gate was E5, but there were literally no signs at all in Terminal 3 that gave any sort of hint as to where the E gates were. Which makes absolutely no sense, since that was where they sent me to find my gate. I had to hear it from a staff member that I was in the wrong terminal, but not before asking at least four different people and getting no answer at all. The security lady decided to give me attitude when all I asked was how to find the E gates from Terminal 3. She told me that I needed to get through security first, which again, makes absolutely no sense at all and is basically no answer. So to sum it all up, this is one of the worst airports ever if you are in a hurry or you have a connecting flight. You will find here slow moving lines, unhelpful and rude staff, and no way to get to the correct gate without having to go on a scavenger hunt, which most people don't have time to do.",-1
2023-06-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,4,1,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,Air conditioning wasn't working,False,  Air conditioning wasn't working in the e-gate section. It was very hot in that wing and humid. Additionally the PA system wasn't working so it was hard to hear information about our flight. No airport officials were present to offer water or assist with anything. The terminal was also dirty and dingy. The only good thing I can say is that TSA here was efficient.,-1
2023-06-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,hard to find a worse airport,False,"  It would be hard to find a worse airport than Chicago O'Hare airport. The traffic, the parking, the poor signage, the rude employees that obviously dislike their jobs, the flight congestion, on and on. Try to avoid if at all possible! This airport is an embarrassment and everyone knows it. Hard to believe there is no accountability for any of it.",-1
2023-05-17,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Very dirty, rude staff"" ",False,"  We arrived from Munich airport, where it was very clean, organized and smooth process to get to our gate and board the plane. Arriving to Chicago O'Hare was a shock. Very dirty, rude staff who were yelling at everyone. It is not my imagination to say there were at least 5000 passenger entering this big area (under construction!) and there were only 5 officers checking passports. We all pretty much missed our connecting flights and had to scramble to get a Hotel for the night and the process repeated itself again the next morning. So disappointed to see one of the biggest cities in US and one of the biggest airport in the world was an absolute disaster. I make sure I will not ever travel through O'Hare and also make sure to discourage everyone I know not to consider this airport as an option.",-1
2023-05-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The security is terrible,False,"  The security is terrible. I was frisked down because I gave the security a bit of attitude after they rolled their eyes at me and aggressively yelled at me to unload my things. Any time I asked a question it was like I was in the wrong. The TSA does not care about anyone who comes through. If you can find a different airport, do so.",-1
2023-04-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,rude and mean security staff,False," I have never experienced such rude and mean security staff. They laughed at me when I didn't push my carry on luggage through, and took my souvenirs and carelessly scattered them. The whole process is extremely difficult, slow and confusing.",-1
2023-04-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,no indication of upgrades,False," Do everything you can to avoid this airport. There are good workers here but it’s not enough to overcome the atrocious design and apparent lack of investment by airlines and the city. You will be delayed. You will have a terrible time in customs. You will have a terrible time getting through security. They will change your gate at least 3 times (to different terminals). You will be shocked at the lack of food and drink options (as bad as the old Kansas City airport if you can believe it). You will get lost due to bad/conflicting signage. They will try to charge you $10 for a sticker (souvenir for the kid). No one will care about any of that or be there to answer your questions. This place should be condemned. I saw an article indicating they invested $8.5 billion here. Someone should be invested for fraud, there is no indication of upgrades. Good luck if you are forced to use this god forsaken place.",-1
2023-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,3,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,never travel through here again,False,"  Connecting through Terminal 5 on the way back to Heathrow. Hardly any restaurants with seats or retail outlets to help pass time. Staff at the Wow Boa and Urban Olive were uniformly rude, bordering on aggressive. The food was basic rubbish at restaurant prices. I get airports are more expensive but at least try! I give UK infrastructure a hard time but none of its airports are as bad as this place. Will never travel through here again.",-1
2023-03-28,0.2,Solo Leisure,4,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,"Absolutely filthy"" ",True,  Had connecting flight out of terminal K. Absolutely filthy. Food court tables were sticky and hadn’t been swept under. Counter in that area of covered in dust. All trash cans were overflowing.,-1
2023-03-17,0.7,Business,5,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"TSA well organized, check in very friendly",False,"  TSA well organized, check in very friendly, After TSA airport employee personnel standing around in large groups, blocking passage. Language used was unacceptable, felt like being on a street corner. Seems like employees should have a break area rather than grouping in gate areas eating lunch or on breaks and acting like at a home party with the enormously loud laughter and joking. I also think the cell phones should be put away when working as it does not make anyplace look like the employees are needed when they walk around on the cell. O'Hare has a lot of employees who seem focused and dedicated, also very friendly, but it also seems like a lot of the hiring was done by a friend as a lot of them seem to be hanging out.",1
2023-02-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,2,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,never fly through Chicago again,False,"  I was traveling back to the country from a short vacation in Cancun Mexico with my spouse. So coming in we had to land from Cancun, navigate immigration/customs - get to trams and to departing gates to reach my domestic flight to get home. It was simply the most backward, unorganized mess of a process I have ever had in any airport. After lines to do that we got through and had to go through the baggage area even though we only had carry on bags. So we had to get into an free for all mess with hundreds of foreigners cramming to shrink into one line to get pas a chokehold were a customs officer selected those to get searched. After this we then lucked out and after being given bad information from a security or police officer that was working an information booth my wife and I lucked out and got on a tram and found the right way to now to to our gate of departure. Now another security screening, everyone goes through the same. line, We finally got through and ran to our gate and directly on to the gate and made it out on time. With not a minute to spare. We have to do better.  Honestly, its intolerable. I will never fly through Chicago again.",-1
2023-01-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,4,4.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,5.0,86 minutes for our bags to arrive,False,"  I took a layover flight, so I could spend a few hours with my daughter that I haven't seen in over a year. It took 86 minutes for our bags to arrive at the carousel. I expected 30 minutes max. This takes my 2.5 hours with her down to 1.5 hours. So unacceptable",-1
2023-01-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,The layout is one long corridor,True,"  Horrible airport. The layout is one long corridor and you may need to walk almost the whole distance twice if you checked a bag for arrival. There aren’t enough baggage stations for the number of flights, to the point where two or more international flights will have to share a station. I didn’t get my baggage until more than an hour after my flight arrived. The airport is also clearly understaffed. If I had to say one good thing about the airport, I can say the bathrooms by the flight gates are clean, although I can’t say the same of those by baggage claim.",-1
2022-12-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,worst airport I have ever been too,True,"  Likely the worst airport I have ever been too. The staff are truly useless. The slowest moving and dumbest people you will meet on your journey. The seating is awful. The outlet placement is awful. It’s a terrible design. If you can avoid this airport please do. Ohare and Laurie Lightfoot take pride in being the best airport in the United States. I have looked into that ranking system. They are not the best, obviously anybody who has been here can verify that. Ohare is the busiest. Way too many people. Constantly understaffed. Truly a terrible experience every single time.",-1
2022-12-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,0.0,,4.0,,"it's a disgrace"" ",False,"  This airport is filthy! The bathrooms were dirty and in ill repair. There was nowhere to hang purse or coats. Toilets were not clean and there was a strong smell of urine. A little bleach would go a long way. There weren't many places to plug in devices to recharge. TSA was dirty and there were way too many people in one place. One area of the floor was filled with water which we had to walk through. For an International airport, it's a disgrace.",-1
2022-12-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,most horrible airport experience,False,"  One of the most horrible airport experience my family had. Concerning luggage, We checked in all our baggage for transfer to Philadelphia and they were all in good shape. However, when we claimed them in Philadelphia we were shocked that couple of the bags were opened that the entire zipper was ruined that it was put together by a tape by whoever that person to keep parts of it closed but still you can see the contents inside. When we opened it at home some of the stuff were missing, and the contents were in a shamble. And one of our bags is missing.",-1
2022-11-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,customs should not take 3 hours,True," I frequently fly out of Chicago, and the first time I experienced customs here, I thought maybe it was a fluke. Maybe they are understaffed or don’t know better. Nope. As a US citizen returning to my own country, customs should not take 3 hours. It has happened to me three times in the last two years. Why can they not figure out to put returning citizens and other visas into separate lines? This is an absolute joke. Arriving in other countries is easier than going home. I don’t know if other airports have this problem, if all of the US is this bad, or if it’s just Chicago. I hate this airport, and would stop using it if it wasn’t my best option without traveling 5 hours.",-1
2022-11-21,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,1,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,dirtiest airport I have ever experienced,True,"  I was here on a 2 hour layover. By far the dirtiest airport I have ever experienced. Bathrooms were disgusting to say the least. And finding feminine hygiene products was almost impossible. I visited 3 stores that sold them but had none in stock, before luckily finding a vending machine. The Reuben I got at the Blackhawks bar and grill was delicious and the bartender was great. I also picked up some Chicago mix popcorn at a Nuts on Clark kiosk. Maneuvering the airport was pretty easy, no problems there. Just would have liked to have had a cleaner experience. The entire airport seemed unsanitary to me from the bathrooms, to the restaurants, down to the seating areas.",-1
2022-10-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience,True," I arrived in Chicago O'Hare at 6:18 pm and had to make a connecting flight which required me to recheck my bag. My connecting flight wasn't until 9:10 PM. I designed this so that I would have plenty of time to go through customs, recheck my bag, and eat dinner before my next flight. That might be true at most airports but not at O'Hare! The customs line was inefficient and took way too long. I think O'Hare needs to look at how other airports (such as Atlanta) manage customs lines. They have a lot to learn. Once through the line, everyone was callous, rude, and unhelpful. I was moved back a significant number of spaces (Maybe 10?) in the baggage recheck line, simply because one of the workers changed the queue line while I was in it so that others could go ahead. Then I had to go back through airport security, which is apparently always a disaster in the evenings at O'Hare. Not a separate security line, but the same security line someone who has just checked into their flight for the first time has to go through. The line wasn't moving, the workers were extremely rude, and I had olive oil I purchased in Croatia confiscated because it was ""suspicious"" even though it was in the proper marked bag for customs. Not to mention, the worker took an extraordinarily long time to check the marked bags, and cut them open. I missed my flight (even though I had a 3 hour cushion), never got dinner because all restaurants closed, and had to sleep in the airport overnight or risk having the rest of my items confiscated since she cut the customs bag open. Absolutely horrible experience from start to finish. I will make extra efforts to fly through Atlanta from now on. They seem to know what they are doing there.",-1
2022-10-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,an abysmal airport,False,"  ORD is an abysmal airport with respect to customer service, signage, and efficiency. Our flight from Paris arrived late to ORD and we were in a panic to get to our connection to Atl. The long walk to customs was ridiculous! We asked a person about MPC and she pointed us to the ridiculous line which took almost an hour to get through, with only one person “helping” travelers. When we finally got to the customs agent he said we could have gone to a shorter line. So basically we were given bad info from the one worker facilitating the line. Then, we had to collect our bags, but none of the carousel signage had our flight on it. Again no one was around for help, but when I finally saw someone she was very rude and no help at all. After we finally found our luggage, we had to try and find info on how to get to Delta. No signs! Someone at AA told us we had to go back out to take the train to the designated terminal. And then check bags and go through security again. What a complete joke of an airport that is a prime example of a nightmare. Needless to say we missed our connection. We did get another flight so we went to the tiny Sky Lounge in 2E. The bathrooms were dirty, the ladies room had a broken soap container, and TP all over the floor. Avoid connecting through this airport at all costs. Or allow at least 4 hours if coming from an international flight. It’s too bad the airlines don’t plan for longer connection times.",-1
2022-10-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"poor design, untrained staff",False," Without even a close contender, this was the worst airport experience of my life. I arrived from Spain and had a connecting to LAX with just over two hours between. The instructions for navigation between customs, immigration/baggage, recheck baggage, security, transition between terminals and gate location were nearly non-existent and posted directions offered no meaningful help. Asking for help was equally non-productive as most airport staff seemed uncaring, unhelpful, distracted and most aggravating, poorly trained. I approached one ""information desk"" to inquire as to how to get from the arrival terminal to Terminal 3 - with my bags. The instructions were basically ""go outside, turn left and go upstairs."" I had left Santiago de Compostelo, Spain nearly 18 hours previous, I am 70 years old and have Addisons's disease. I replied, that I just didn't believe that physically I was able to make it. The young man simply turned away, not to help someone else, simply turned his back. I was finally able to get assistance by tagging along with someone in a wheel chair who had an airport attendant. My flight boarded late apparently due to airport congestion preventing the plane from approaching the gate. Repeatedly having the boarding/departure times changed resulted in virtually all passengers standing for more than 45 minutes. There are no ""queue"" lines and passengers just grouped - congesting the walk ways. I might have been able to put up with all of the incompetence were it not for the ""canned"" voice of the mayor of Chicago (I assume it's an election year) coming on the PA system more often than the meaningful and necessary announcements to brag on O'Hare as an excellent, award winning airport. It was like shining a spotlight on the poor design, untrained staff, non-existent directional signs, and just plain lack of caring for tired travelers.",-1
2022-10-02,0.1,Family Leisure,5,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,terminal 5 is very poor,True,"  International departures - terminal 5 is very poor. Going through security I was asked to unzip my top - for an under wired bra search. Unbelievable. Once through security, there is barely any seating. The majority of shops are closed. Restaurant/food choices are minimal and ridiculously expensive and airport staff were generally rude. Signage around the airport is also poor. I ordered a Burger King meal and Pepsi without ice. When the drink arrived, it came with ice which I don’t like. I requested one without ice per my order and was told I couldn’t change my order. I explained I wasn’t changing my order, I simply wanted to have what I had ordered in the first place. I was then told I had to have ice in my drink as it was allegedly ‘airport policy’. Customer service couldn’t have been more disinterested and I’d love to know why an airport is dictating whether or not I have ice in my drink. Utterly ridiculous.",-1
2022-09-22,0.2,Business,3,1,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,not the airport it once was,True,"  Chicago O'Hare in 2022 is not the airport it once was. I wouldn't know the airport it once was, because I'm 33 and it's been on a downhill trend for my entire life. Yes they're trying to make improvements and I've even heard rumors of a major terminal construction project, but the airport doesn't feel like it belongs in the first world. TSA staff are rude, the terminal (5) is crowded, the seating is falling apart. As I write this I moved seats three times to find one that wasn't dirty or broken (Gate M20, TAP Airlines). They recently re did the train between terminals but it took a ridiculous number of years to complete, and terminal transfer was hell for that entire time. Chicago deserves a much better airport than O'hare. I would recommend flying through Milwaukee if at all possible, or if your traveling internationally, arrive in NY, Houston, ATL etc and connect to your final destination.",-1
2022-09-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,An awful experience,True,"  Arrived from LAX for a transfer to LHR from Terminal 5. This was my first time at ORD, and hopefully will be my last. Thankfully I had a reasonable transfer time as the airport experience was a total hideous ordeal and frankly an embarrassment to the operators. Signage is useless, the transit train was rammed - with the door inexplicably opening and closing without reason, but the worst part was the ridiculous security queue. There seems to be no priority queue for those holding a premium cabin ticket, but the guy who was ‘directing’ the queue should be removed with immediate effect. There is signage in the cattle pens that indicates the requirement to be polite and courteous to TSA staff, but that deal should work both ways. The big guy who was on duty in T5 on Sep 9th was shouting at passengers like animals. He was rude and quite frankly a bully. I suspect he may have been bullied as a kid and was venting his frustration at tired and annoyed passengers. An awful experience and hopefully I will never have to experience that hell hole again.",-1
2022-08-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst airport experience ever,False,"  Worst airport experience ever. I had a 3 hour connection at this airport, but I spent more than 3 hours waiting in line just to get through customs! There were no fast lines for connections, but just one line. The people near customs were shouting at us to get in line, but were no helpful at all and the wifi was barely working. I missed my flight, the airline said it was not their fault and they could not do anything to help me except for rebooking me on the next flight, that was 17 hours later. I had to sleep on a bench at the airport waiting for my flight. The temperature was really freezing, I had to put on 2 jackets. Really bad experience.",-1

We had a 2 and a half hour connection at this airport, but we spent 3 hours waiting in line just to get through customs! First of all, why do we even need to go through customs if I am literally leaving the country 2 hours later and won't even get out of the airport. We missed our flight, the airline said it was not their fault and they could not do anything to help us and the next flight was 24 hours later. We had to rent a terrible motel near the airport and wait for our flight. There were no fast lines for connections. The people near customs were shouting at us to get in line, but were no helpful at all and the wifi was barely working. Really bad experience.",-1
2022-08-16,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,what a joke of an airport,False,"  Flew in to terminal 5 more or less on time and the plane was made to taxi around the entire length of the runaway to get to the gate. The pilot wasn’t impressed over the intercom. That was the first delay. Finally got to the terminal to be met by massive queues. I had 1 and half hours to get through to my connecting flight so I thought I might be ok -  from point of landing to crossing the border it took 2 hours! I kept asking staff if I could skip ahead, no one had any interest in helping what so ever and wouldn’t help. Half the border control posts were unmanned so that didn’t help. I of course missed my next flight. Got to the American help desk and no flights available and no help what so ever. Only way to get to my next destination was to get a hire car and drive. All I can say is what a joke of an airport. If you can’t handle the volume of traffic coming through then they shouldn’t be allowed to sell tickets with transfers. Either that or sort out the infrastructure and staff. Let ticketed transfers in to another queue or utilise what you have and actually man the desks! Looking at other reviews this isn’t a one off. I won’t use this airport again. As an international traveller having been on the plane for over 8 hours was also very disappointed by lack of food and drink and no working wifi",-1
2022-08-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,conditions of terminal five are very poor,False,  The line to get through customs at Terminal 5 was about a half a mile long. There was one long line with very few customers employees on duty. There were plumbing issues with the ladies restrooms while waiting in the customs area for 2+ hours. The conditions of terminal five are very poor and appear to be understaffed.,-1
2022-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,5,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,need more officers to speed up this process,True,"  August 9th my 9yr old, my husband & I arrived at Chicago O'Hare after a 4hr flight, a 3 hr layover & a 14hr nonstop flight from Dubai to Chicago & soon after we exited the plane we saw signs for US citizens & visitors to follow right side of the rope & Universal passport holders on the left side. This led us down a 2 hour excruciatingly tiresome long line that probably spanned the entire length of the airport to the Customs & Immigration counter. There were tired little kids fussing, including my daughter who got sick on the airplane. There was couple who had a connecting flight & they politely asked one of employees monitoring the flow of passengers if they can skip ahead as their connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes, they were allowed to skip further up but I don't know if they made their connecting flight & they were still 5 people ahead of them. The Immigration officers take their reviewing documents while masses of hungry & tired passengers are waiting in long lines. After we finally made it through customs, we couldn't figure out where the baggage claim for our airline was since the TV screens were showing only most recently arrived flights & not the ones that arrived 2 hrs ago. The employees were not helpful, so we looked around for other passengers from our flight & followed them. We found 2 of 3 luggages rather quickly but there no carts to be found. Many passengers including us ran around looking for carts & after 20 minutes we finally found one, we still needed to follow another line to handover the Immigration declaration card at the exit, thankfully this took only 20 minutes. They need to do a better job of making more groups or categories at the Immigration lines to speed up the process for people who have connecting flights, people traveling with young children etc. They need more officers to speed up this process. It's atrocious! Even when we left for Dubai couple of weeks ago the security check in took almost 2 hours. So yes you do need to be at the airport at least 3 hours ahead of your flight & God Bless you if you have a connecting flight at O'Hare.",-1
2022-07-27,0.3,Business,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,4.0,plan a 3-hour layover,True,"  Arrived at Terminal 5; mixed reviews. I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the bathroom and ease of getting through to baggage claim but then it went downhill fast. It was quite a long wait for the bags to come out and then everyone from all the belts had to get through customs check but there was no organization to that at all- just many lanes of people having to condense into one lane where there was only one agent collecting global entry or customs forms. He wasn’t checking anything. Once through that mess, it was not clear how to get to the trains- very poor signage. For a major international airport it was a disappointing experience that could easily be fixed with a little more organization and a few signs. Thankfully all staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. I would suggest if you are coming in on an international flight and have to make a connection, plan a 3-hour layover or you will likely miss your connecting flight.",-1
2022-07-16,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,absolutely the worst experience,False,  I fly internationally for a living. Terminal 5 at Chicago o'hare is absolutely the worst experience in my entire career. An International wing with only one Burger King restaurant and other options open during the mid morning. This would be fine if you were traveling out a new to pack a lunch before you came to the airport. No charging stations at the gates. Horrible experience from beginning to end.,-1

I fly all the time and have had an easier time locating the ride share area in other countries/languages. Additionally, when I attempted to go up the wrong elevator in my confusion, the man that addressed me was incredibly rude. This obviously only heightened my frustration with this airport. To be honest, if that man had just kindly helped me, I probably wouldn’t have cared how hard it was to locate my pick up area.",-1
2022-05-27,0.5,Couple Leisure,3,3,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,,This is one crowded airport,True," This is one crowded airport. The United concourses are brightly lit with clear signage. Connecting to an international flight requires taking the inter terminal train to Terminal 5. Despite it being a very warm day (90 degree temperatures), the AC was not effective. Train carriages were rather warm. Terminal 5 needs a major renovation. Upon disembarking from the train, there was one long narrow line to go through TSA once again. Passengers who arrive on connecting domestic flights shouldn't have to go through TSA twice. The concourses are very crowded and the lighting could be better. There are signs posted re terminal renovation/expansion which is desperately needed.",1
2022-05-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,It was definitely survival of the fittest,False,"  We just returned from a long delayed trip to Scandinavia and Great Britain. I wonderful trip - including attending a family wedding. Unfortunately, we returned via O’Hare with a connecting flight to our hometown in Wisconsin. Our SAS flight from Copenhagen was great - we arrived on time. Once we were arrived at the International terminal - a whole different story. Long lines for passport check - which was fine - we had a 3 hour layover for our flight home. You were geared through the line - yelled at by what seemed like over worked employees to move here, move there, etc. Got through with a passport stamp and a stamp on our customs declaration card and thought ok - not too bad. Next - loud announcements ordering us to get our checked luggage (which had been checked through to our final destination) before going through customs. We found the baggage carousel with people packed around - and had an anxious two hour wait for our bags to arrive. All the while - customs agents walked around with dogs sniffing hand luggage for illegal contraband like an orange or an apple. I like dogs - so this was okay. During that two hour wait - many of our fellow passengers were in despair that they had missed their flights. Once we got our bags - we went through another line with our bags past a single agent who took our stamped customs card. That was the customs check. We then had to find the American desk (no signs) and recheck our bags. They agent there said just leave your bags there and run / you have an hour to your flight. We ran to the train to get to our terminal. We then had to go back through security - where there was a line. When waiting in line - someone told us to go to number 7 instead. We ran in the direction he was pointing - as no idea what no. 7 meant. Got to another security line - made it through. Got to our gate just in time. Flight delayed a little so finally able to use rest room. Got on the plane - sat on the tarmac for two hours due to backed up traffic. Then storms hit - flight cancelled. The American Airlines crew was apologetic. Off the plane - in long line that did not move to get rescheduled. Gave up - no flights for at least 24 hours. No help from American couldn’t even get close to the front of the line after waiting an hour. No help therefore with food (managed to buy two donuts before they closed) - no help with hotel. Nothing available nearby online. Missed the last bus home. Spent about 2 hours finding our luggage- went to three different luggage carousels. At that point we were operating on rumors from other passengers on where luggage might be. At about 1:30 in the morning after being up for about 24 hours - we booked seats on a bus for 7 in the morning and spent the night in a noisy, freezing cold, uncomfortable airport. No food available obviously. I had some chocolate in my bag that the dogs didn’t care about in customs. That and the two donuts we managed to buy. It was definitely survival of the fittest - were old (60’s and 70’s) but in good shape. We made it home after being up for about 35 hours. We were amazed by our welcome to the US.",-1

It hands down has the rudest employees we have ever met. You can always count on getting yelled at at some point. We left Charles De Gaulle airport, where the people couldn’t have been more lovely and helpful, and landed at O’Hare only to get yelled at. Our reaction was, “Well, I guess we’re home.” So much for “Midwest Nice.”",-1

Every airport we went through was efficient and kind. When we got to O'Hare we had to go through customs. I understand. Then we had to go through another inspection. I don't understand but I will do it. On this second inspection we were told to go here and to go there and to go back and to etc. Finally we got through the inspections. The people were rude and unhelpful. My wife and I could not use the restroom or get a drink of water or get anything to eat. There wasn't enough time. When we got done with the inspections we ran to the terminal to get our plane. We were late just from our arrival and the inspections we needed and their inefficiency. We were the last persons getting on the plane. There was nothing to eat or drink on the plane. Fortunately, they did have a restroom.",-1

My main issue are directions and signage. Thankfully there were plenty of people to ask. Picking up signs for T5 was tricky. We had to go through security again which was a pain and it wasn’t clear until the end of the line that we could have gone through a pre checked line. Having said that, although we had to queue, it was efficient. There is no working WiFi at T5 and we had to hunt around for charging points for our phones which actually worked. It would have been nice to get a hot drink at our food outlet.",-1

I used Terminal 3 for my flight and found the airport extremely uninspiring for a long wait. There are hardly any seating areas which are comfortable or allow you to rest without being in the middle of crowds all the time. The charging points are very few and uncomfortable to use. The options for food are limited and crowded. Not really sure why such a developed country has airports which are a trial to be in.,-1

Limited food options, dirty tables, stale packaged food from the kiosks. Overflowing trash bins, tired decor and ripped and torn seats. If I was a lived in Chicago I’d be ashamed to have guests arriving at this terminal. My wife an I travel to many developing nations and most have airports that are newer, cleaner and better.",-1
2022-02-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,I will not go through another experience like this in the future,False,"  My flight from Europe was late arriving and I was provided a special boarding pass to fast track through the airport and get me to my final destination in Appleton. The first stop was customs. They didn’t care that I was in a hurry to get through to catch my flight. The workers were yelling at people and gave me a look of contempt when I showed them my boarding pass with a red outline which was to guarantee quick access as well as holding my flight through the airport. By the time I got to the counter to check my bag the clerk smiled and said you are 6 minutes too late to catch my flight which wasn’t leaving for 35 minutes. She said I can reschedule you for a flight leaving tomorrow at 3.30 and provide you a discount for a hotel. I lost it after being up for over 24 hours and encountering so many rude workers at that airport. A manger heard me even though I didn’t raise my voice and offered to help. He was able to reschedule me on a flight to Green Bay which was to leave at 7.30. That flight was delayed until 10.30, no reason provided. We didn’t arrive in Green Bay until 11.30, and didn’t arrive home until 12.30. This horrible experience has ended any future travels. As much as I love to travel I will not go through another experience like this in the future. The sad part about my experience is this is the norm not the exception at this airport.",-1

Immigration treats you like animals, ventilation is close to nothing, the airport seems to never be on track with time, packed with people and the cleaning is horrendous, the inside looks like a forcefully decorated prison facility. It would be generous to call this an airport. To top it off: a bottle of water bought from inside the domestic airport can’t be taken to your international flight.",-1

Omicron in the US and people running around maskless. The charging stations seems to be from 2005. There is zero social distancing.

But alas no luck there. Mayor Lightfoot blames this on the pandemic and Canadian boarder closing (contractor) but I remind her that the completion date was originally 2019 before the pandemic. More recent testing showed that the trams had problems in winter weather. Did we forget to mention that we have that in Chicago?

Buses that frequently get caught up in traffic jams. Now for some bizarre reason they’ve put the Covid Test Site far away on the Bus Terminal meaning a huge long ride if you discover you need to take a test. This wouldn’t be so bad if the train system was working. Unfortunately I live in Chicago and am obliged to use this awful place.,-1

They assumed I knew their procedure and barked at me with what to do. Finding an outlet to charge my phone wasn’t easy. Was at a table and an entire side had dead outlets and USB ports. The tables for eating and charging stations were also dirty. Did not look like they had been wiped down all day. Is covid not on the rise again?,-1

Yelling at me and a group of my friends was their way to get documentation for travel on a domestic flight from Europe. The same at baggage check. I have been to a lot of airports but this one was the worst of the worst. Being treated like a criminal or prisoner is not something I’m used to or enjoy. The wifi was not working and the waiting area was covered with trash. And internet was not working. Shame on you that you employ such nasty people! There was not one employee who would be kind and greeting with a smile. Shame on you that you don’t keep the airport clean. I will always avoid this airport in the future.,-1

There's directions to a drive thru covid testing center for travellers that doesn't exist! I spent a half hour looking for this imaginary testing site. Of that wasn't bad enough when i dropped off my rental car there were no signs to the covid testing center anywhere in the airport! So i kept wandering around asking where i need to go getting conflicted directions! For those of you who don't know its in terminal 2 across the street from the Hilton in the bus shuttle center. I hope that saves you a headache and a back ache. There was at least one nice employee that helped me but most of the staff are always rude! If you can avoid this airport!  They tried telling me i needed a PCR test when the country guidelines clearly said antigen is acceptable for my destination. If i listened i would have had to pay an additional $375 on top of the outrageous price of $120. In Germany they sell a similar antigen test for 3 euros or around $5.

Overall, the service has improved significantly but be ready to walk and leave enough time for transit. The food options improved significantly as well. One problem however for international is the transit between terminal 5 (where most but not all international flights leave) and the other terminals - the train between these terminals has been under construction for several years with no end date set (which is absolutely bad management) so avoid international travel if you until the work is done.",1

Does Gordon Ramsay fix nightmare airports too? Our flight was delayed with no notification. Gates changed twice, without notification on the loud speaker. Thank goodness I read the email. Our plane was small, hot, and in poor condition. Staff at the help desk were reluctant to assist me, once they assumed I ""had a long story"", which I didn't even. It was one sentence. The airport itself has dirty restrooms, one of the smaller Starbucks was in a shocking condition. Power outlets throughout the airport do not work. Very sketchy taxi drivers are stationed outside the lower level. This airport in one of America's largest cities should be the standard, American flagship-model airport that other airports around the globe should wish to emulate. Instead, ORD provides the worst airport experience I have ever had! And I have traveled to many different states and countries. This facility should be absolutely ashamed of itself.",-1

Me and my family were looking for help to print our boarding pass and staff were extremely rude and did not help, the staff member treated us as if we were stupid, we just needed help and his attitude was not necessary. After we went in through security and the staff there were super rude and disrespectful. I am very disappointed, If I don’t have to I will never fly here again.",-1
2021-02-27,0.1,Business,3,5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,It was just shameful behavior by staff,False,"  It is upsetting to know that O’Hare airport is part of our current cultural problems. I am a lifelong resident of the Chicagoland area, and I always believed that we had a pretty good airport. I recently returned home from an international, work-related trip and came across two different employees in Terminal 5 that were extraordinarily rude and disrespectful to not only me, but fellow travelers alongside myself. Instead of helping us along the extensive additional requirements that Covid has brought upon us, employees were incredibly rude. In fact, the final pass through was with a lady that screamed at everyone to stay in line and get their papers ready. I was shocked, and actually already had the paper she was screaming about in my hand. She acted as if we weren’t allowed to travel and shouldn’t be there. Well...here’s reality, I am a single mom with two kids in college, so when my company asks me to travel I do it. I am respectful, had my mask on and bags already in hand and also had the paper she was yelling at us about ready to show her. It was just shameful behavior by staff in terminal 5 at ORD. I am sorry if you hate your job so much that you take it out on people just trying to make it in these difficult times. This is the reason why people are leaving Chicago...let’s all just try and be peaceful and nice.",-1
2021-01-11,0.5,Business,4,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,a reasonable airport though crowded,True,"  Chicago O'Hare is generally a reasonable airport though crowded (at least in non-COVID times). I was arriving on United and departing on Turkish, so I arrived at one extreme end of the airport and then had to exit security and take a bus for a long time to get to Terminal 5, then go through security again. Terminal 5 is a weak point of the airport, though it looks like there is a train going in (still outside security). In January 2021 half the lounges are closed and my airline hasn't bothered to make an arrangement with the ones that are open, though that is not exactly the airport's fault. In my past experience, the lounges here are lame compared with those in the United areas, which I could not use since there is no way to get through without leaving security. ORD should organize the Star Alliance carriers to depart from the terminals United uses since international connections are common, it would save all kinds of difficulty for travelers. Terminal 5 may as well be a different airport since you have to allow at least half an hour to get there and leave security, you could make it to Midway airport in not much more time.",1

And I have traveled extensively all over the world. The service is absolutely deplorable. Lazy, arrogant and downright cruel sums up the creatures who work at this place. They lost my luggage and finally after an hour found it back at our gate. They would not bring it to baggage but instead reissued me a boarding pass so I could go back to the gate and get it myself. I was traveling alone with two young children. They had zero compassion and were zero help! Avoid United and this airport from hell!",-1
2020-12-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,Very rude and unfriendly employees,False,"  
Requested wheelchair service to American Airlines gate. Upon arrival told to sit in handicap area and someone would help me. Waited and not one person arrived, next employee said check in at kiosk. Did that, told to sit in handicap area again. Very rude and unfriendly employees. A young man arrived with a wheelchair to get another passenger and asked if I needed help. He told me go to baggage to get a special ""pass"" and someone would come with a wheelchair. My flight was at 1.05pm, Dec 2, 2020. I was at the airport at 10.40 am. I had to get up two more times to ask if someone was coming as it was 12.15 pm and my plane was boarding. One employee snatched it out of my hand to call and see when someone would get me to take me to gate. The purpose of a wheelchair service is so I did not have to walk around everywhere yet I had to anyway to get help. Finally a nice woman arrived, stopped to let me get water and took me all the way on the ramp into the plane. She was kind to me and very apologetic, the only person that was. There was no wi-fi and the place is filthy. I do not think a nonstop flight was worth the nightmare I endured with rude indifferent employees. On that note they could learn from the considerate employees and the cleanliness of the South Carolina airport. Upon returning today, Dec 3, yet another rude employee when I got off the plane she was there with a wheelchair but couldn't sit in it due to other passengers waiting for luggage. Walked the ramp myself then she wheeled me to baggage only after I insisted. She did not speak, just looked at her nails. Very strange young woman, I asked where the restroom was and she said over there somewhere. Big zero rating",-1

I tried for hours during my layover to get any sort of a connection to the internet, with no luck. If I was just bored, I would have shrugged my shoulders and moved on, but I had time sensitive work I needed to submit before my flight departed. Thanks to O’Hare and their joke of a WiFi network I wasn’t able to submit assignments for my College classes or do work for my actual job. When you promise your customers WiFi on your website, maybe you should actually make sure, y’know, you can deliver! I absolutely blame O’Hare for this embarrassing problem that hopefully won’t affect my standing at my job or with my professors. Unacceptable! I will go out of my way to never, ever, ever use this airport as a connector on flights ever again.",-1

You have to take a bus to travel between terminal 1 to terminal 5 which is an International Terminal, may take many hours to pass thru security. It is crazy with a lot of people everywhere.

They have so many people standing at the kiosks for no reason at all. Because everything I needed assistance the people was just talking amongst each other and we’re no help at all. I had to go walk and get a lady (the only one that was helping clients) so she could help me too when there were at least 10 other people there. Will never use United from O'hare anymore that’s for sure,1

We flew out of L9, supposed to be 8.30pm but wound up being 11.50, the area was like an oven, so so hot. Because of the delay we we wanted food and drink. Nothing after 9.30pm unless you wanted McDonalds. How ridiculous for late flights. They cater to early flights and don’t care about people taking later ones. Come on why close the place, it’s crazy.",-1

2020-01-19,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,"Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge",False,"  We had a connecting flight to to RSW. As soon as we got to customs, it was chaos. People were packed into the large room waiting for others to wander around looking for an available kiosk to scan their passport. So unorganized. How about putting the kiosks in a row for people to use while in line? Once finished, we had to stand in long lines again waiting to get checked through. There were only 7 windows open for hundreds of people to funnel through. And, not to sound like ""that guy"", but they were speeding the non-citizens through a lot faster. 2 were for working visas and students, 5 for citizens and tourists. They should be putting the tourists with the non-citizens. They should also have a line for connecting flights because this is the second time we almost missed our flight due to this mess and we weren't the only ones stressing over a connecting flight. Once we eventually got through, getting our bags was pretty quick and easy, but after that, there were no signs saying where to go next. We just got in the super long line with everyone else. My wife went ahead to talk to someone to make sure we were in the correct place. That person told her that we needed to go outside the huge room to a different place so she ran back and got my son and I and we did as he said. Once we got out and the doors closed behind us, we found out that we were in the right place before and now we had to wait for someone else to come out so we could go back in. We went to to counter to talk to them again and they said to just leave our bags there and go to our flight and they would scan them in for us. I didn't feel comfortable about just leaving our bags next to the counter while they were checking in other people who were waiting in line, but we had no choice. Our flight had started boarding and we were nowhere near the terminal. We missed using the family lane for going through security twice because the lane was roped off. Someone who works there saw us and opened it and they were genuinely surprised that he had to tell us to use it. In all the chaos, we lost one of our boarding passes, so we had to rush to the ticket counter to get a new one printed. She insisted on reprinting all 3 passes even though we only needed 1. After that was done, we started to run to the next step when my wife checked and saw they printed the wrong name on my boarding pass. We decided to just use the old one since it didn't need to be reprinted anyway. It was like she was deliberately wasting our time when we had none to waste. We ran to the tent outside (by the way, we weren't dressed for cold weather because we had no plans to leave the airport so my 7-year-old was freezing right along with us) where we were told to wait for the bus. There were so many people that we had to wait for the next one. We knew we had to go to terminal 1, but when the driver stopped, he never said anything. He just opened the door. Now, I could assume that the first stop is terminal 1, but I hate to make assumptions and get off the bus at the wrong terminal when we're already pressed for time.Luckily, someone else said they could see a ""1"" outside, so we got off and ran. We made it to our flight while they were almost finished boarding. 2 hours should have been enough time to get through, but it almost wasn't. Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge at O'Hare. Can't rate some things because we had no time to use them.",-1

We get moved around on other commercial airlines throughout countries worldwide to and from our trips. The arrival ORD CBP/DHS terminal 5 culture here with our country is so screwed up. They're focusing on the wrong things here. Goods purchases overseas preoccupation and then the fruits, vegetables, fruits, cheeses and the US citizen exemption amounts. When we should be concerned with perpetrators, impostors, criminals and those who wish to our country's entry and to create intentional ill will. Or drugs, etc. The human treatment here is horrible and disrespectful towards it's 'right to be here' US citizens. Especially towards it's born, legal to be here citizens!

The customer service interaction/communication at security was unpleasant and down right rude, unprofessional and demeaning! No one smiled or provided eye contact when speaking to you. They were extremely rude and degrading. The desk attendant at Spirit counter was also extremely rude while speaking and giving his speech over the intercom!

Crowded and not enough seating facilities, A/C is bad and shops awful. Don't even want to check the bathroom and still have nine hours until my flight. Coming here for a connecting flight had to exit, going through a tent, waiting for a bus.",-1

The service here is deplorable. We we told that getting wheelchairs has been privatized and they are pretty slow. We also have a dog that needs to pee and all there is here is concrete. Not very accommodating. This may be our last time flying to O'hare if this isn’t fixed soon.,-1

We're sitting in Terminal C - the seats are broken, the seats are torn in some places and the bathroom are dark and dingy. What's up Chicago? Millions of people travel through your hub every year! Why do you present your city like this? An environment like this also likely causes decreased morale in your staff, they don't seem very happy.",-1

I'm tired of moving off to the side so they can zip through loaded with people too lazy to walk. I'm 72 and I walk. I'm done giving way to those maniacs. Hit me if you want but I'm not going to the wall so you can zip through. Done, no more.",-1

I can understand weather, but technical and maintenance issues are insane. At least the last 10 flights including the one I get to be stuck on right now is delayed delayed delayed. I never ever fly out of here on time. I hate this airport.",-1
2019-10-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,4,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,the experience was a real mixed bag,True," I've never had any particularly negative experience in the times I've flown in and out of O'Hare (although they did lose my luggage in 2014, which was quite annoying). In 2019, the experience was a real mixed bag, first things first, most people I met working at the airport could not have been friendlier or more helpful. A true positive. Even the TSA personnel and incredibly overworked gate agents were patient yet efficient, though, I know this isn't always the case, as with the overworked yet strangely entitled and lackadaisical barista at Starbucks. Oh well, there always seems to have be at least ""that one"" in airports. However, while I've never had particularly negative experiences, this airport is still not easy to like or embrace. It's clearly outdated, outmoded, and overused, if you've ever watched ""Home Alone,"" which came out in 1990, I'm pretty sure the airport looks today just as it did in 1990 (and even earlier). The airport is dirty all the way around and not well taken care of, even smelling what I can describe as dank and damp in certain areas. Gate seating is not ample. While there are plenty of dining and shopping options both pre- and post-security, many of those options have a sort of dingy feel, no matter how well run they are and how friendly the staff are. The lighting and flooring suck, and even the sporadic display of attractive, futuristic-by-1980s-standards artwork doesn't change that fact. Even though the area of Chicago in which O'Hare is located is generally nice and middle-class, the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train station below the terminal has a strangely uncomfortable feeling - and the station and CTA trains are just filthy, even though the station is less than 30 years old (that's CTA's fault, though). Back upstairs, ride shares take longer to arrive and drop off than at many other large airports, even when things aren't particularly crowded. In all, O'Hare provides a poor introduction to, and representation of, an otherwise friendly, vibrant and unique city called Chicago. What a shame.",-1
2019-10-06,0.1,Business,3,3,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,this was one of the most unpleasant experiences,True," It was quite busy when I arrived and went to the TSA line # 8. The woman who scanned my boarding pass was just lovely and I couldn’t be happier with her. She took time out of her day to ask how I was and truly meant it. When I went to get my things from the conveyer belt, the woman who was handling the baskets with the basket cart was coming through and I must’ve been in her way and couldn’t move quick enough. She screamed ""excuse me!"" (Every single person in that line looked at her with wide eyes because of how obnoxiously loud it was) with a huge attitude. So I moved out of the way and I said ""oh, I am sorry ma’am"". She walked on by ignoring me and then rolling her eyes and laughing with the other TSA woman doing the pat downs. I’m sorry, but I should’ve never been treated that way and this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever been through in an airport. I will make every effort in the future to avoid this airport.",-1

So we were late taking off. Then we land, have to taxi for 20 minutes to our gate, and then are told our gate is occupied and we have to wait. I had to wait an excessively long time for my bag (had to check it at the gate before leaving my original destination). And then I had to sprint to my connection only to be told boarding closed literally seconds before I got there. The worker surprisingly wasn’t too rude about it, but I was still angry that they couldn’t hold the flight for 2 minutes for myself and 3 other passengers from my original flight. It’s not like the plane left on time anyway. They rebooked me on the next flight out (an hour later) and luckily it wasn’t delayed, but it still took forever to actually take off!",-1

The staff try to mask this by constantly shouting at customers and by treating them as if they have perpetrated serious misdemeanours and are under arrest. Guys, we know about security. We really would like your owners to give you better organisation but this isn't our fault so kindly stop yapping and tàke up your issues with management. Also, wearing a uniform does not entitle you to be impolite. I actually experienced a customs officer mimicking my accent. And in the obvious culture of workplace bullying that flourishes in this airport, I was acutely aware that this man clearly wanted me to react so he could pullme out of line. BTW I am an obvious little old lady. The city authorities of Chicago need to be aware that this airport represents them to their incoming visitors, and it does it badly. Really very badly.",-1

Very rude when they were screening my carry on. We had very little time for connecting flight and my daughter was using wheelchair assistance - helper was excellent - he was the bright spot. However they held us up as they wiped down wheelchair - which had come from inside a security checkpoints. They also completely patted me down, including crotch area and all over my person. Unbelievably rude bag screening personnel. This was the second horrible experience here coming from London. They also sent our luggage to the East coast. I would avoid this place like the plague.",-1

SRO, no room to sit or walk. No flight status updates available in terminal at all and the on line and app info was always at least 1 hour behind actual info. Never again will I fly Frontier or any other airlines through this terminal.

Terminal 5 is shocking. Nothing works, the train is broken, the toilets are clogged, the security lines are long (and terminal 5 does not even accept precheck!?). The shops are scarcely stocked (except for sundries and candy). Free WiFi requires payment when you click on. Food outlets are overwhelmed. Lounges are among the worst of any major global city. This is Chicago? A world class city? If I had to move my company to Chicago and use terminal 5 I would have to pay extra hardship allowances for my management. Third world conditions affecting the staff who care less about service because they are treated like animals instead of ladies and gentlemen. The board at chicago O’Hare should resign because of the long lasting horror show at terminal 5. And the airlines that pay to use this service should be questioned as well.",-1

My experience in the O'Hare airport was a total nightmare. There were multiple flight delays, and they changed the departure gate three times, with the last change forcing all passengers to go from the C terminal to the B terminal. In the end, the flight to Houston departed at about 10 pm, a delay of 6 hours, and for me a total of 9 hours spent in O'Hare, not knowing when, or if, there would be a flight to Houston that day. There was almost no place to sit, so most of the passengers were forced to stand for hours. This airport is poorly designed, managed horribly, and it does not have enough gates.

After four different passport and customs checks, complete with lines, (oh and a ceiling light crashed to the floor 1 0feet to the left of me, fortunately missing the people walking in that area), you then have to go with your full baggage on a bus to a separate terminal where you get to wait in another bag drop line, then you get to go through the full security all over again. This brings you to terminal 1, where exhausted and hungry travellers are met with only fast food options with food courts, no sit down restaurants with a full kitchen. Ok, there is a sit-down hot dog restaurant, and a sit-down sandwich counter, these do not count. Even the pizza is by the slice and warmed up.

2019-07-12,0.1,Business,1,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,No fast food outlets anywhere,True,"  
I have been traveling internationally to Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East frequently for about 25 years. I am very familiar with international terminals in all these places. Unfortunately, I live near Chicago, so I must fly in and out of O'Hare's international terminal (Terminal 5) regularly. I have three complaints: One, I'm used to airport food concessions being rip offs, but at least elsewhere there are relatively low-priced options. But not O'Hare's Terminal 5. No fast food outlets anywhere - only expensive restaurants. Last time I was there I had two hours to kill and was hungry, and I ended up paying $20 for a cheeseburger and a bottle of water. Two, other airports have decent bookstores. Schipol in Amsterdam comes to mind. But not Terminal 5. I guess in our dumb country people don't read books. Three, when you arrive for departure at other airports, there are free luggage carts available. But not O'Hare - they're $6.00. O'Hare sucks!",-1

2019-06-22,0.1,Business,1,2,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,1.0,will not be traveling through ORD again,False,"  I can overstate how truly awful it is to have ORD as a connection point for an international flight. The degree of disorganization, coupled with the overall sprawl of the airport, makes for a bad experience. The bussing of passengers between the international and domestic terminals resembles something analogous to cattle being herded into a milking contest at the local county fair, the signage indicating what to do and where to go is very minimal and confusing. Between the bare-bones number of TSA screeners on shift and being selected for additional screening/pat down, I missed my connecting flight by two minutes. The airport workers made it very clear through their half-mumbled non-responses that they did not give even care about trying to help me identify who I should speak to regarding the situation. If it were possible to rate the airport staff as a zero I would do so. I will not be traveling through ORD again under any circumstances unless it is my final destination for a trip, I would recommend to others to do the same.",-1

They have no system in clearing passengers and did not care if they are late to their connecting flights. Took hours to get processed and had no translator for foreign speaking passengers. Tokyo airport who’s staff speaks little English will put this airport to shame. Staff on their cellphones instead of attending to passengers. Not courteous at all. They ate the worse. A lady asked a staff member if there is another line as she is getting late for her connecting flight. The response she got was “everybody has a connecting flight. The nerve of these people. I think they are taking their uniforms too seriously to intimidate passengers. If this represent the people of Chicago tourism would collapse in this city.

I think to get a job here you need to write in your resume that you just don’t give a damn about people needs and feelings, I’ve never experienced such ruthless and humiliating way of treating people when they are shaking and sweating begging them for help, I wasn’t alone and you feel like they move and talk in a slow motion, talking on their cell phones (are they allowed to make personal phone calls on a clock?). Going from terminal 5 to the domestic terminals is a horrific nightmare if you have a short connection, you probably will miss your flight, the driver of the bus was collecting employees on her way to my terminal after I’ve asked her politely how long would be a drive that I’m afraid not to make it to my gates. I’m sure my review will not change anything and the way this administration hires its people, but I will definitely avoid this connection in the future.",-1

Upon arrival, there was no wait to find a kiosk for printing luggage tags and boarding passes, however, after that there was a 45-50 minute wait just to drop your luggage off. The line was so long that it looped through the concourse making it confusing to know where it began/ended. The people who were supposed to be helping were pushy and short as if we were inconveniencing them and not the other way around and several people missed their flights because of their mess. Tsa workers were continually shuffling which security areas were open which made the wait longer (a couple who arrived 30 minutes before me made it to the same gate at the same time because they had gates closed just as they were about to enter security twice). It was just unpleasant, unprofessional, and disorganized. For context, I fly out of LAX 2-3 times a year and this airport made LAX seem like a well oiled machine.",-1

We waited around two hours once off our Norwegian flight to go through to passport control. You have a self serve machine where you have to put information into and then queue again to do the very same. The women who are supposed to be helping you don't and the two I came across were so rude. I asked a question and the young girl looked at me, turned around and walked off! I am horrified to think that they are in a job! If this was London Gatwick or Heathrow Airport they would not be in a job! We had similar timing issues at the airport for our departure where there were just four men checking the security on all international flights going through terminal 5! Very disorganised. O'Hare being a large hub airport and looking at other reviews here, they should take on the feedback and learn from this in moving forward.

2019-05-20,0.3,Business,1,1,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,We will not be returning,True,"  Traveling is already a stressful occasion. Here are some tips to make it easier on people. The attendant that is supposed to check if flyers are “pre-checked” or not should actually do their job. A guy behind us literally said they aren’t sure if they’re pre-checked and she never stopped to explain or check his pass or anything. she just hurried him along in line. Some people are first time flyers. Be patient, be helpful, do your job. help educate them so next time things can go smoother. Next — allow families/groups to stay together. When one attendant is pulling one-by-one from three different lines, the person or people I am traveling with could be very far behind me. This is not conducive with groups of minors. It can be scary and allowing them to stay together is a small courtesy that could be extended to help out. Teach your workers patience. It was terrible here. Back home our airport is respectful and understanding, this was a huge shock for my group and I. We will not be returning. It’s about to be a long day and this experience has made it longer.",-1

The security lines are a nightmare. I have been flying through O’Hare for 20 years and the problem only seems to have gotten bad over the last 3 years. When you arrive to the airport, you’ll be surprised to see that there’s a line out the door for TSA. This line takes minimum 30 minutes to go through. Once you’re past a certain point, you see how much unused space there is & start to wonder why they’re not using that space for TSA.",-1

I do want to point out a customs employee flagged us down and let us cut in line because we were traveling with small kids but that was after an hour.

They re-directed the line multiple times until there were about 10 people waiting for one immigration officer while the remainder of the line were filtered through about 3 other officers in the same time. Even when the 3 staff had processed the longer line, one of the women refused even to acknowledge a polite question by someone in front of me as to whether we could move back to the main line. So ridiculous and ironic given that she was wearing a jacket labeled ""I can help you."" She was just as rude to people who did not speak English and refused to answer other perfectly reasonable questions about where people should go.

Lack of runway or belts like in other smaller airports (Colorado, Dallas 5 star for instance). Cleaner, more comfortable and more accessible is better than nicely decorated.

I was asked rude and invasive questions during the searches. When i asked why my phone was being searched i was told it was ""random extra searching."" Finally finished that and was given bad directions by an airport official for transferring terminals. This led me to exit and enter security again which was painfully slow. After getting through security I learned that i was again at the wrong terminal (i was too early for my flight to be posted and both security and airline officials directed me to the wrong terminal.)

People who are clearly irritated working with the public and want you to know. From the TSA ID reader at security checkpoint 7 near American Airlines in Terminal 3 who wants you to extend your left arm to place your phone on the reader but not move your body at all, and when you accidentally do, becomes angry and tells you how unhappy he is b/c people don’t listen, or the other agent who doesn’t explain how to place your bag on the roller but is very disappointed in your actions by yelling, “Do not push!” I get it. You hate me, you hate people, and you hate your job. I have traveled back with students from abroad to be greeted with angry agents who separated my students from me, sending them to separate security checkpoints, and rushed us so fast through lines my kids kept screwing up. TSA didn’t care. Kids were crying and the anxiety spiked. They still did not care. If you want to feel worse about your existence, go to O’Hare.

2018-11-02,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,4,3.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,it was okay overall,True," I was flying in to Minneapolis from Hong Kong, and having chosen United, needed to pass transit at either Chicago or San Francisco- seeing as he overall travel time would be shorter via Chicago, I opted for them. Despite most people I know telling me that O’Hare is awful, I thought it was okay overall - in fact, I found them quite efficient. I arrived in a Chicago on a Thursday. Being Canadian, I was able to breeze past immigration through their automated clearance system, and got through in 10 minutes. The immigration officer had a serious expression, and waved me through really quickly. My bags arrived shortly after I reached he reclaim area. Seeing as my flight arrived 2 hours early, I tried to get switched to the earlier flight, and after the United ground staff dealt dealt with the frustratingly lengthy process of rebooking my flight, she was able to land me a seat on the flight and helped me ensure that my bag would be checked in to that flight despite there only being a one hour window to departure. This also meant that I needed to rush to Terminal 1 from the international terminal. Rushing to Terminal 1 is normally easy, seeing as they have that automated people mover, but it’s undergoing long-term maintenance/being rebuilt in sections, so it’s closed on weekdays. This meant that I was at the mercy of the shuttle bus, which was obviously slower to board and arrive, due to the very peculiar traffic design between terminals. There was this one intersection that allowed one bus through at a time and took close to 10 minutes to clear. Despite all that rushing, I was still able to get to my flight in time, partly due to their speedy TSA crew that in dealing with the backlog decided that’s passengers could go through with their shoes on. My flight back from Minneapolis occurred without a hitch, though arriving with a 3 hour layover gave me a chance to really soak up the architecture and movie filming locations in the 3 main terminals. I probably could’ve also tried their dining, but alas, I have not. When it comes to waiting for flights, the seats at Terminal 1 are old, but adequate. I appreciate their provision of outlets near seating for device charging, but it would probably be even better if they also provided USB ports on the outlets, and fitted universal outlets seeing as travellers may not have the correct adaptors. Also, Boingo is still the main WiFi provider in the airport, but they now offer a few hours of unlimited wifi every time you watch an ad. The ads aren’t that long, so I’d argue that that’s okay, and for cost recovery, it’s not too annoying.",1

2018-09-22,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,a horrible experience,False," I had a horrible experience at Chicago O'Hare recently. On September 3rd, we had an international layover on our way to Italy for our honeymoon. There were some weather issues which caused our incoming flight from Seattle to circle the airport for a while before we were finally able to land. No problem, I get weather issues. Once we were able to deboard the plane, we had to find the international terminal. The airport had very poor signage for this, so we stopped to ask a staff. He told us the quickest way would be to go to the end of the G gates and take a shuttle to the M International terminal to avoid having to exit the airport and go through security again. Once we got to G17 where the shuttle was, a female airport worker told us she needed to see our boarding passes and passports. We handed them over and she said she couldn't allow us to be shuttled until she confirmed our flight was still there. I told her that my Delta app confirmed that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. I had also heard an announcement that all flights were delayed from the weather since no planes were able to take off or land. She insisted on checking Google Flights for her update as well as got on her walkie-talkie to ask someone who was in the international wing if our flight was still there. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and we need to board our plane. This person who works at the damn airport would not use the airport computer to check our flight status and continued to rely on Google Flights. She told us that she would not shuttle us over because apparently our flight had left. I told her she was wrong and she refused. I was furious. I grabbed our passports and told my husband, ""I don't trust that she is right. I think we still need to make a run for it and go to the international wing by ourselves."" We exited the airport, caught the rail train and went through security with 10 minutes to spare. We finally made it to our gate and what do you know, our flight was still there! We were able to board and had about 5 minutes.",-1
2018-09-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,Avoid this airport,True," Avoid this airport if at all possible. Horrendous experience both arriving and departing. When we arrived it took over half an hour to get off the plane because information on connecting flights had be posted just outside the exit and caused congestion. We then made our way down to immigration control which was in chaos. There were no proper signs just some people shouting instructions which nobody could understand. We followed people and ended up in the wrong place. After 10 minutes we were then told where we needed to go by somebody we could understand. This was the longest queue I have ever seen, It took us 15 minutes to get to the back of it. When we got near the automatic machines we were stopped for about 15 minutes because the queue after the machines was too long and was clogging up the machine area. When we used the machines our documents were rejected. We later found out that the machines were rejecting 95% of people. This was the basis of the queue. Because of this we had to go in the next queue to be dealt with manually. Altogether it took nearly 3 hours to get through the immigration. Departing was not much better. After checking in, which took about 40 minutes because BA do not have a bag drop option and only 2 desks open for Economy and Premium Economy passengers we were then faced with another huge queue for immigration. It was so long it spilled out onto the check in area. Once through immigration the security check was relatively quick although I had to be body searched because I left a plastic comb in my pocket! It took over 2 hours to get through. One of our worst experiences at a USA airport, although departing from here was also bad a couple of years ago, so a place to avoid.",-1

The more stresses that can be eliminated from it, the better. I think one of the biggest stresses is the time it takes to go through security. O’Hare’s security is efficient and friendly allowing travelers to place their items on the scanning belt at their own pace without holding up the rest of the line. We were able to get in a through security in less than 20 minuets which is fantastic. Great job!",1

One airline had two flights leaving within an hour but was assigned a limited number of check-in counters. This caused the line to spill in to the hallway and blocking foot traffic. Once you clear check-in, the immigration and final security is done in a small area where there is not much of a system. Lines can crisscross and you really need to be patient as you go through the process. I had a red eye flight and I wanted to get a meal before boarding. Unfortunately most restaurants were closed by 9pm. As expected the one open restaurant was swamped with customers. The restaurant staff could hardly cope with orders taking a long time coming. There appears limited seating in both check-in and boarding areas. Wi-Fi was not working in all areas.",-1
2018-08-25,0.7,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,"an abundance of restaurant choices""
",True," I feel like O'Hare gets a bad wrap overall for a few reasons, but some issues are legitimate, and the experience will vary greatly depending on which terminal you go through. For starters I usually fly United, and usually go through Terminal 1 or 2. I don't fly through Terminal 3, and my experience in the International Terminal has only been for one arrival recently. That said, I can break down Terminal's 1 and 2 which are good overall in my view. For starters the main issue with United is connecting flights can take a little while to get around. Terminal 1 is separated into two concourses connected by an underground walkway. In theory you could have a connecting flight on United Express which are mostly located in Terminal 2 despite your regular United flight may land at the C-Gates in Terminal 1. Therefore, you may have to walk from the end of the C-gate to the central area to reach the underground tunnel, go underground the tarmac, pop up at Terminal 1, then go to the end to reach the walkway to Terminal 2, then you'll cross into Terminal 2, and finally you are at your gate. It sounds like a long walk because it is. I recommend at least have 30 minutes to transfer flights. Then the other issues at O'Hare can be queue times for TSA, or some restaurants. I can say from personal experience the TSA at O'Hare have been relatively quick, as in no more than 20 minutes to get through during most times, however, during some peak times such as 4-6 pm, then lines can get long and take over 30 minutes. It has been random since sometimes during ""peak times"" things have been quick. I finally got TSA pre-check, so I'll see how that goes when I fly out tomorrow. Finally the last big issue is the poor wifi. It's Boingo which is too expensive, and at times it doesn't process your purchase correctly. Try to get into a United Club for wifi. I have gone through some personal negatives, and likely negatives for flyers in Terminals 1 and 2. The good news there are pluses. For one, the food choices are good. There are some local chains including Rick Bayless own chain which has solid Tex-Mex sandwiches, and amazing Guacamole. I believe Wow Bao is located in O'Hare, and there is a local tea chain as well. Meanwhile there is an abundance of restaurant choices such as steak, Italian, seafood, cafe food, etc. From my experience I haven't had a bad meal. Keep in mind, don't expect Michelin star restaurants, but if you have a good layover, then you can get a good meal. Finally the bar scene isn't bad, but prices are airport prices. At least Goose island has bars with local tapped beer. Finally the last positive is the location. The blue line connects to O'Hare, 24/7, to the Loop. It's near I-90 and I-294 which help drivers get around anywhere in the Chicagoland area. That said, if you are going to Northwest Indiana, or Joilet, then it'll take a good hour to get there from O'hare. That said, the taxi stand is outdated and slow. Expect to spend a good 30 minutes to get a taxi. Overall it is a good big airport. It's not perfect, nor the best in the world since I've been to LHR to Narita, however, as a large US airport it's one of the better ones in my view. Especially compared to EWR or elsewhere.",1

I was not aware this was a rule. I apologized and moved it back. Even after that I was harassed by the same staff member for not moving it back ""right"". Look, I was understanding about being stuck on a cot here after purchasing a 400 dollar ticket so why cant the staff be understanding and accommodating to me as well.

They try to provide Express support to people with short connecting flights but they failed miserably due to lack of coordination.

Horrible, lazy, and unhelpful staff. So many open spaces where they could cut down the lines but they just lean against the wall, laugh and chat up with other security, and I even saw some sleeping on the job. After I asked 1 of the staff there for help on my gate number, they told me to google it and went back to leaning on the wall. I asked another one and they misdirected me to 2 different terminals before I finally found it on my own. They also were disrespectful and made jokes about us like "" can you even see "" and laughed about it with a co worker. I highly advise anyone that plans on a trip to steer clear of this airport.",-1

Apparently information desks are only staffed when they feel like it. Probably the worst thing was the employees - rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. My daughter kept saying, ""can you imagine being from another country and trying to navigate this place?!"" Oh, and don't come hungry if you need to travel overseas - everything in that terminal closes really early.

They leaned against walls and chatted about their social plans while ignoring travelers. I believe the employees may purposely misdirected you if you ask for help. They tell you to go in the opposite direction. The airport must be managed by the same types who run Chicago. Masses of travelers bottleneck at crucial checkpoints where clearly it needs to be staffed by several employees, only one or two employees check documents when hundreds of travelers are trying to move to connecting flights. I don’t recommend that you ask anyone for help because they will lie or treat you with terrible rudeness. The entire airport is filthy, covered in food debris and dirt.

It is the most disorganized, unhelpful disgrace I've ever encountered and I've travelled extensively including 3rd world airports which function far better than this place does. I had the misfortune of transiting through O,Hare on my way back from LAX, which isnt much better. On arrival in T1, I looked for the ""In Transit"" signs or directions to any sort of ""Transit"" desk or information. There was none. I walked for what seemed miles, looking for some sort of information or advice on how to proceed. The flight information board didn't show my connecting flight either so I had no way of knowing where to go or which terminal I should be looking for. The information desk was unmanned. Eventually I found a young lady who was on a security checkpoint. She advised me that I should make my way via shuttle bus to Terminal 5. Having done so, I then stood for 11/2 hours at security before I reached the gates only to find that there were no flights form my carrier (United). Again, I spent ages trying to find someone to speak to for information. Eventually I found a woman pushing a trolly. She advised me that I should be at T1 as that's where United fly from. By now my 3hr transit window had all but gone. I returned to the shuttle bus and the Queue was over 200 people deep. I approached an official with a yellow jacket on who was supposedly in charge of the queue and explained I have an extrememly short connection, he refused to allow me on the bus and told me to join the end of the queue. I had no option but to barge through or I woould miss my flight. Eventually I made it back to T1 and through security AGAIN and eventually to my gate with 5 minutes to spare. Frustrated, harassed and sweating. An absolute disgrace! No information and some very unhelpful staff. I don't blame the young lady I spoke to at T1, it was not her job and she made an honest mistake but the rest of the staff where totally uninterested and rude.",-1

I have flown through Chicago twice - the first time my flight was delayed for 6 hours and I didn't get to DFW until 4am the next morning, and this time my flight was delayed 5 hours and then canceled. I slept on the airport floor and my flight was rebooked to next day making it a 21 hour layover when I was only supposed to have a 3 hour layover. Now we are sitting in the airplane waiting for departure but now we cannot take off from the gate until the gate agents tell us we can. We are currently 30 minutes past our departure time.

We were hoping to get through security and then sit and have a drink and a meal as our flight wasn’t till 11:40pm. By 8:30pm nearly all the shops, bars and restaurants were closing or closed and we couldn't find nowhere serving food. The one Hudson shop open had queues snaking around the shop continually and was the only place available to get any kind of food. The services were completely inadequate for a large airport!

2018-06-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,,an unnecessarily cumbersome system,True," My husband and I arrived at the International terminal with baggage having been checked in Great Britain. We were connecting to another US flight. We had to pick up our bags and then turn them in again (all we did was carry them over, no checks occurred along the way, why can't the airline handle this along with any additional checks of our luggage?) Then, we were guided onto buses that took us out of the security zone, requiring another time through security. Unfortunately, some duty-free liquor we had purchased after clearing security in Britain had not been sealed as required, and we were forced to check it for an additional $100 fee and we almost missed our connecting flight. If we had known about the additional security clearance, we would have made sure the liquor was sealed as required or bought it in time to put in checked baggage. But never in international arrivals elsewhere have we had to leave security just to keep our original bags checked. This seems an unnecessarily cumbersome system that needs to be fixed. Until it is, we will never again book an international arrival into O'Hare. You have lost our business. For the sake of others, please see that airlines warn people that they will have to enter security again at O'Hare, so they need to be careful about liquids they acquire after initial security clearance.",-1

I am a frequent traveler (bi-weekly flyer), and ORD was by far the worst organized airport I've ever experienced. From the food choices to the unorganized airlines to small terminal seat areas. Chicago O'Hare Airport is at the bottom of my list, and do not recommend this airport to anyone - experienced traveler or not. Doesn't seem like the airport staff care either. If they did, things would improve. It's extremely disappointing this is one of the Chicago airports. This has made my trip a very bad experience.",-1
2018-06-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,either rude or unhelpful,True,"  We had a connecting flight here between London and LAX. It was a horrible experience from beginning to end. Good thing our flight from London was an hour early because it took us 2.5 hours and we barely made our next flight. Every employee was either rude or unhelpful, and there were no visible signs to direct us. When we arrived we opted for Mobile Pass because they recommended it on our prior flight saying it would speed the process. The airport wasn't equipped for it and employees had no idea what we were talking about. We ended up in a long line for it after having a woman yelling at us for being in the wrong line. Several loud monitors blared Olympic-like music along with a weird ""American pride"" video which felt like something you'd see in North Korea. Picture this with a loud woman yelling the same thing over and over in the background and combine it with sleep-deprivation after a 9-hour flight. Welcome to America. There were multiple lines throughout the following process, from customs to another security checkpoint. All were very long with unhelpful rude employees. There were no visible signs telling us where to go. We ended up lost several times and nobody would help us except for a few volunteers in yellow shirts. We were then loaded up like cattle onto a bus just to get to terminal 1 after waiting in another long hot line. We then had to cut in line at security because the line looked like Disneyland and by then (2 hours later) our flight was already boarding. When I asked a TSA agent for help, he said he couldn't help me and that our only hope was to ""ask everyone in front of us if we could go ahead of them"", so we had no choice but to forge our way through hundreds of very angry people. We ran to our gate and barely made it for our next flight. We will avoid this airport next time.",-1

For this reason alone we were taken aside and spent 3 hrs waiting to be questioned by customs officers. After a long flight I sat on a hard bench with no food watching customs treating people like they were sub human. At one point two officers high fived after they had upset one lady! Our questioning consisted of whether we were trying to have a baby in the US (“no we are only here for 10 days for a wedding”) and then lots of questioning regarding why we weren’t trying to have a baby in the US (“because we have a house, jobs, family, the NHS and we are just on holiday!”). He couldn’t believe we had free healthcare in the UK (perhaps do some research). At no point did he ask us whether we had insurance or to see our return flights. Completely inadequate questioning! Rather than question pregnant women for hours perhaps you should look at changing your laws so that anyone who has a baby there doesn’t automatically qualify to be a resident (if what he told us is even accurate). I won’t be returning. Really poor reflection of Chicago which is a beautiful city.",-1

Although it is easy to find where you need to go for immigration, the line for customs is not marked at all and I ended up in a very long line when I could have been in a short global entry line. The staff are clueless, I asked two people who sent me to the wrong line. There’s also insufficient signage to explain where to go to recheck your bags. Many people stood in one long line only to find that there was no line at all at their connecting airline but the signage not indicate any other option.

",False,"  I am a born and raised Chicagoan that is extremely embarrassed at the poor operation for international arrivals at O'Hare. The airport staff are completely clueless and have no issue yelling at each other and at passengers (employees at passport control). They go out of their way to make the process more chaotic and difficult (customs). As an example, the line at customs to leave the baggage claim area was extremely long. Personnel waited until passengers went almost completely through the line before telling a few people ""there is no line at carousel 3"". If they had directed passengers to other available counters, the whole process would have been easier. The tram to other terminals and to access CTA was not available, but they had shuttle buses. Instead of having signage posted, they simply put ""Closed"" signs on the escalators heading up and had rude and unprofessional staff standing there. When asked how we were supposed to access the CTA, I was told ""it's not running."" What she really meant was that the tram was not running. At that point, I had already spent over 2 hours in the airport and was so tired of dealing with incompetence that I took a cab rather than deal with any other employees. Seriously, O'Hare. You need to get it together. So many people experience Chicago only through your airport, and you make us look hood.

After passing security, we looked at the displays, saw that there was a single flight leaving for our destination and assumed that it would be ours, but it turned out that it was an AA flight leaving half an hour later than ours. We ended up losing our flight with Spirit, having to spend the night in a hotel and buy new tickets for the next morning with a different airline.

I've flown to this airport (to and from and mostly for connections) at least 30 times. Certainly smaller airports with no connecting flights are more comfortable because of the sheer volume of flights and customers. But I have to say that I have always found the gate personnel more than helpful each time I've needed them. Flights at O'Hare are typically delayed and take a long time but that's part of the business when you travel to a place with so many flights. When I have tried to board earlier flights or needed exceptions made, the gate personnel are always as accommodating as they can be. If you know what to ask for and ask politely you'll find typical Midwest hospitality at O'Hare.",1

Security had 2 staff working, TSA staff extremely rude, then we had to run to terminal 2, still did not make our flight and plane left without us. Shuttles and terminals should be open until all flights are in, especially connecting flights.

Went to the information help desk to be dealt with by a rude and snotty girl. She was too busy wanting to eat and pick her orange instead of helping me. She told me I had to phone and speak to United Airlines. My transfer had nothing to do with United. All I wanted was to use the phone for 2 mins.

The terminals are always crowded but there are lots of seating, eating places, and shops. Signage is good. Restrooms look old though are kept reasonably clean given the high usage. I had connections and was able to spend the time usefully. The biggest drawback I felt was the long distances between terminal gates and in the absence of moving walkways, going from one gate to another is rather tiring. Always worried about winter travel through ORD fearing a snow storm will be very disruptive. On this trip, the connections were made without any delays.",1

2018-01-12,0.5,Business,2,2,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,find O'Hare to be busy and crowded,True," I fly weekly for business, and connect semi-regularly through Chicago O'Hare on American Airlines. American is all in Terminal 3, concourses G, H, K and L. It can be a hefty hike from a commuter flight at the end of G to a flight at the end of L, as it's pretty spread out. In general, I find O'Hare to be busy and crowded. The concourses are too narrow for the number of travelers, and the usual boarding-time gate-cluster can choke off the entire concourse. The restrooms are generally abysmal - tiny, crowded, questionably sanitary. It's not through any fault of the staff, I regularly see staff cleaning them but O'Hare's restrooms are generally 2 or 3 stall wonders, sprinkled here and there for millions of travelers. O'Hare's dining options, on the other hand, are great. My personal favorite is the Cubana Torta from Frontera Torta in Terminal 3 - it's life-altering. There is an ample selection of dining choices whether you want fast food, upscale dining, healthy salads or a Chicago pizza. Shopping is also similarly good - I generally only need drinks and snacks, but O'Hare has the largest Hudson News I've ever seen, in the common area between Terminals 1 and 2. There are a fair number of upscale stores throughout, though. Connecting through O'Hare, I always make sure I have more than an hour between flights. Two hours is better. I have been delayed many times, to some extent or another, on my arrivals into ORD. Sometimes it's a broken regional jet. Sometimes it's a weather delay. MANY times, though, it's a delay from ground operations, after we land - my personal record is spending 45 minutes taxiing and parking out on the tarmac due to ground traffic. I would count on spending an average of 20 minutes between landing and actually reaching your gate. I still use O'Hare. It's the only airport American serves from one of my local airports, and one of only a few from my other home base. Flight selection through O'Hare is generally good. It's just the actual experience that suffers, in my experience.",1

I know they handle thousands of people everyday and I understand that they must follow a lots of regulations, all for us travelers security, and I’m fine with that. But, why do they have to be so rude, unpolite and even humiliating? It feels like they treat us travellers as some kind of idiots and they can say and do whatever they want just because they can. This is not ok! Therefore I suggest that you give them an education in good behaviour. Unfortunately, I’m going to avoid O’Hare and chose other aiports as far as it’s possible.",-1

This time, flying on United, we were delayed three hours into the airport because of weather. We arrived at 10 pm to discover we missed our connecting, express, flight by 30 minutes. No other flights to any nearby cities were leaving that evening. We thought about renting a car and driving (4-5 hrs) home, but the costs were over $250 for those agencies willing to even let us take a vehicle one way. United rebooked us on a 7 am flight the next day, but would not offer hotel vouchers. By this time it was almost midnight. The service agent mentioned that ""somewhere"" in Terminal 2 cots might be available for the evening. We wandered around until we discovered probably 100 people already resting in cots in Terminal 2. Kudos to O'Hare for making these available, however, never throughout the night were the lights dimmed in the corridor, nor were the TVs turned down or the overhead announcements stopped. Additionally, the airport employees continued to walk by talking loudly, or driving various vehicles as if it were 11 am, not 3 am. It was like trying to sleep at a racetrack. And then they woke us all up at 4.30 so they could put away the cots! I am sure the city of Chicago would prefer that we all go get a hotel room, but an additional expense of $100 and up is often not in the family budget - not to mention the time involved to travel in and out of the airport. We would have all been much more impressed if customer service in the form of a quiet corner to sleep had been offered.",-1
2017-11-15,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,3,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,a very efficiently operated airport,False,"  
Chicago O'Hare is a very efficiently operated airport. Flights were on time, service was good, and boarding was quick on all the gates I passed. I was using the International Terminal and I didn't have a chance to view the domestic wing of the airport, but I was impressed with the airport operations. The food near the international terminal is pretty good choice wise and the bathrooms near the terminal are clean. When asking for directions to a gate, or room, the cleaning staff and Customs Officers are very helpful. The flights from the terminal were all on time, except for one, which had a two hour delay coming from Brazil. From what I observed, the ground crew was working quickly, and getting the job done. Overall, Chicago O'Hare International Airport is a great place to use as a international departures airport if you live in the Midwest area.",1
2017-11-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,3.0,you can do better than this,False,"  ORD, not a very international airport! We arrived from DFW connecting to international flight. There were absolutely no signage as to how to get to terminal M from the H/K terminal where we arrived. We walked a huge distance in the wrong direction returning to gate K19 area. Then after taking the bus to terminal M, they dumped us off at M16 where no flight information display exists. We had to walk to M8 just to get basic flight information. Come on, ORD, you can do better than this! Very unfriendly to international travelers. Even Heathrow does better than this!",-1
2017-10-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,4,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,I was given no direction,False,"  I don't know where to start. Most airports have some kiosk where information can be obtained, or staff who can help arriving passengers. There was nothing. I was arriving after many hours of travel from South Asia via Qatar. After the surly, scowling passport control officer slapped my passport onto the counter with a sort-of grunt (no ""Welcome home"" here!), and after a harrowing experience at the baggage free-for-all, I was given no direction how to get my baggage through customs and back onto my ongoing flight to Seattle. Most airports have this part down, but queries resulted in mocking statements like ""It's obvious, just follow the people over there."" The people ""over there"" were not going to American Airlines to get their already-checked-through baggage onto the next plane, or to hand over their customs declaration form (by the way, nobody took my form and I never found any customs officials). Every query I made of some official-looking person resulted in more ridicule and less information, as the hour of my departing flight grew nearer. When I said that I had a tight connection to make, officials said that was just too bad. Why go on and on? I must say that this was my worst airport experience in 38 years of travel all over the world-mainly because of the rudeness and angry, scowling personalities of airport staff. They did not want to be bothered with helping or giving information. I barely made my connection, and that only happened because one nice woman took an interest and told me how to get my checked-through baggage back onto the plane and that I needed to go to a different terminal by train to get to my departing flight. When I finally found it, I was screamed at by security officials. Wow, Chicago, overall rating is a zero for you! I somehow doubt that you care, though.",-1
2017-10-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,passport officer rudest encountered,False," I want first to second the comments of a UK traveler about passport control (I’m an American citizen, Chicago native.) The passport control officer was the rudest I’ve ever encountered, and I’ve traveled throughout the world, he had no eye contact, no speech, just pointed, with a scowl on his face and an attitude of pure hatred toward the people passing through. The personnel in the automated passport control, seeing people with clear need for assistance, ignored them, except to bark commands like “no cell phones” and it was unclear who they were talking to and what that really meant. I had just returned from Edinburgh where security was very careful but where people explained things clearly and were extremely polite. Apparently in Chicago expressing hostility is how you make things secure. Also last month I picked up my son there who flew in on Virgin America. Zero flight information posted for Virgin, zero. Virgin office closed. Employees I asked acted suspicious about why I was there. All the pretty restaurants don’t make up for the people.",-1
2017-09-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,"rudest, least helpful, least polite staff",False,"  This passport has the rudest, least helpful, least polite staff in the USA. When my husband and I arrived at passport control, the guy asked us how long we were staying. We answered that we were residents with a visa. Very sarcastically, he replied ""No you're not! What does it say here?"" (pointing at our passports cover, as if we were unable to understand). It says ""United Kingdom"", not ""United States"". We tried to reply that we actually live in the USA and we have visas that allow us to do so, but he wouldn't have it. ""Again (as if he were speaking to one year olds), what does it say here? ""United Kingdom"". You are not citizens"". He repeated this several times, without listening to us. Knowing that, unfortunately, he could potentially be spiteful and delay our entrance to the country indefinitely (and our dog is here, so at least we wanted him back!), I had to restrain myself and just reply: ""We are residents, we never said we are citizens. We live here and have done so for four years now"". Finally, the penny dropped. ""Ah, yes, there's a difference"". And that was all. No apology for treating us like children, for his smugness, rudeness, or his mocking attitude. I can understand he can make a mistake, but it's unforgivable that he should have that attitude without even having listened to us. He treated us like we were having a hard time understanding anything, when in fact it was him who was misunderstanding the situation (and not making any effort to get the facts before answering with his stupid arrogance). It's always a shock to come back to O'Hare, as anywhere else staff is friendly and helpful. Every single time.",-1

It's big and sprawling, but everything is clearly marked, staff are generally friendly and laid back, and boarding is by zone or section of the plane (not by who shoves as in much of Europe and elsewhere). You can eat well and get your drink on easily and without paying that much more than going city prices. You can take a train into town for $5. Overall, it might not be glamorous, and I'm sure that business-class travelers don't get the fawning attention they might receive elsewhere, but this is a solid beer-and-a-shot airport for the rest of us.",1

Every single employee of this airport I encountered was surly and rude. The immigration officer checking the kiosk outputs was off the scale rude - sarcastic, shouting out at other lines with a face like thunder - he was scowling so much. What a contrast from my Heathrow Terminal 5 experience - it just isn't necessary. Whomever is responsible for the staff at this airport needs to invest in some customer service training for their staff and sort out whatever it is which makes them so miserable if they hate their jobs so much!",-1

The queuing systems seemed to work perfectly efficiently and the newly introduced one-stop-priciple for passengers travelling with handluggage only did a great job. In addition, the train service at this airport is great although there is no airside link between the terminals avialable. My general impression of terminals 5 and 1 was that they were very clean. Moreover, the variety of shops, restaurants and cafés cover a broad range of tastes and they are a gorgeous option to shorten the waiting time.",1

2016-08-13,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,hard to navigate through it,False,"  6th June. This airport was very crowded, and it was hard to navigate through it. It was also strange that I had to pass through security control again since I had to move from a domestic terminal to the international terminal. The queues were indeed very long and time consuming. However, when passing through finally, it showed up to be efficient with modern scanners that accepted to just put the bag through without having to put out computer and liquids apart from the bag. That system is well recommended in all Airports so the security checks can be more efficient. The worst thing is that it was not so easy to navigate and it was so crowded. It was quite clean, but it could be a bit better. I can however recommend the Airport since they actually do their best in their situation anyway.",1
