Bryce was very kind to help us find transportation to our hotel. He went above and beyond his job to make sure we arrived safely. I was very satisfied.,1
2018-01-01,0.4,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,4.0,very unpleasant experience,False," As a rule of thumb, we avoid changing money at airports, unless the country we’re visiting isn’t “credit card friendly” or we’ve been advised to use cash for certain purposes. Although Costa Rica is credit card friendly, we read that changing money at the airport is advisable. This was a big mistake. In comparison to the exchange rate and charges at a bank in San José city, we “lost” around 15% due to changing at the airport — this was the largest percentage we’ve lost amongst all money exchangers at an airport. For us, this was a very unpleasant experience especially for incoming new tourists. Moreover, one of our luggage was “lost”, and there was only one person for the airline accommodating — it took us over an hour in the baggage claim/lost and found area.",-1
2017-05-18,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,criminal price of food inside the terminal,False," San Jose is a small but plucky, tidy and efficient airport, marred by a couple of flaws and bottlenecks. It is modern and adequate for the passenger flow except Upon departing, the early morning flights (6 to 7.30) cause the security line to grow enormously, though it is processed in the most efficient way. While more and more airlines have switched to include the departure tax, the line can still be huge and at some points of the day it's poorly staffed. Upon arrivals, there is a critical rush hour at noon where several flights from the US, Mexico and Central America arrive at the same time, causing immigration lines up to 2 hours. Other than that, immigration is usually quick and baggage claim is very efficient (around 5-10 minutes). Customs clearance is also very quick. The other topic is the criminal price of the food inside the terminal. Costa Rica is an expensive country, but it goes to cringe worthy levels where you pay $6 for one Cinnabon roll (you pay $3 in CLT), $11-$15 for a burger with fries and refreshment. You seriously need to come with some food in your stomach (especially if you fly in the early morning flights). Another uncomfortable point is that there is no arrivals hall per se, and once you cross customs you'll be literally thrown to the street.",1
