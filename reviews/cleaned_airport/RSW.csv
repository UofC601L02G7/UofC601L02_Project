2022-08-25,0.6,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,were extremely rude this morning,False,  One of the TSA Security Guys on C were extremely rude this morning. Lack of proper communication was a huge issue. Please tell me politely to not take my small electronics out of my carry on bag (which has always been the procedure before) instead of yelling the words so quickly that I did not have enough reaction time to process what was being said. Patience and kind words were all that I needed. Please work on this.,1
2022-06-17,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,employees are nice & very helpful,False,"  RSW is a great airport! The employees are nice & very helpful. The shuttle & parking employees are the best~ especially Theresa! My husband accidentally left his backpack (with meds, computer, & cash) on the shuttle in long term parking today! I drove Back 3 hours later & got it. Everything is there. They were so kind & helpful. Theresa had his backpack in the office. What a relief! So glad there are such good people in the world!",1

Lack of proper communication was a huge issue.

2021-05-23,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Staff were extremely rude,True," Staff were extremely rude. Every part from ticketing, to security, to boarding all spoke down to us customers. Very disappointed in the continued disrespect. Security were also beyond slow. I can appreciate good security, but the airport wasn't busy at all and it took forever as they kept just taking their time.",-1
2021-03-28,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,Fort Myers airport is so poorly equipped,False,"  Fort Myers airport is so poorly equipped with bathrooms, enough restaurants, stores that are open, and places to watch TV. There is not one TV in the waiting areas. If there is a delay, there just are no seats available. Breakfast food was not available at 9am. They were out of both breakfast food and coffee by 9 am. The lines for pre packaged food were 20-30 people long. They need to visit an airport like Grand Rapids MI to get it right. Grand Rapids is the same size town and so much more efficient and consumer friendly than this Fort Myers airport. Fortunately, the staff were friendly.",-1
2020-08-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,belittle their customers,True,  I think everyone can count on more than two hands the amount of rude experiences at an airport that they’ve had but today’s stood out more than usual! My boyfriend and I set our backpacks down after having gone through TSA already to go grab a bagel which couldn’t have been more than 10 minutes. When we came back to our seats there was a guard standing near our stuff with a dog. We didn’t think anything of it and then he approaches my boyfriend to belittle him in front of other people that you “can’t leave your bag unattended” and “it makes people unsettled”. He went on for about 5 minutes and then told us some other people may be coming to talk to us. All for a backpack ?! What is TSA for if you’re still worried about my bag?! Maybe this airports needs to put signs up saying not to leave bags unattended before they belittle their customers for their unwritten rules. Attached is a picture of the dangerous scary backpacks!,-1
2020-03-23,0.2,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,This is awful and disrespectful,True," We are under a pandemic and I am wearing a mask and gloves, respecting 6 ft distance. Workers at security didn't want us to maintain 6 feet and told me they didn't care if we all got sick. one guy called me sick girl and said you decided to fly, you should have stayed home. This is awful and disrespectful. Security needs to be more aware of the part they play in helping keep people safe. Otherwise, they can stay home.",-1
2020-02-09,0.5,Family Leisure,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,they have horrible wifi,False,"  Small airport, clean and friendly staff. However, they have horrible wifi. Make sure you have a good data plan if you have to sit for a while for your flight.",-1
2018-09-30,0.8,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,4.0,clean and welcoming,False," This airport is clean and welcoming. The problem I recognize is the preponderance of dogs not being carried or placed in a designated kennel. During my last visit, I saw an emotional support animal lying on the floor in the TSA queue. Three dogs on leashes were seen at the Jet Blue gate. Announcements about dog rules and regulations are made repeatedly but are ignored. Signage would be helpful enforcement is needed.",1
2018-03-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Parking there is a mess,False,  We dropped off and picked up twice in March and went to cell lot to wait. Parking there is a mess! Cars are parked everywhere they shouldn’t be and people can’t move or get out. Has no one ever checked this problem out? Wish I would of known I could of taken pictures and sent in. I will definitely next time!,-1
