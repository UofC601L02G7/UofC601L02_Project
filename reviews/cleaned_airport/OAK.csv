2023-02-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,,What a dump,False,"  What a dump. Arrived in the morning, only 2 coffee shops open and each had lines out the door. No other food options. On the return trip layover, I made the mistake of stopping by a Mexican restaurant. The menu was limited and food tasted like re-heated frozen food. The layout is poorly thought-out. The queues for the airlines spill out into the walkway. Anytime a flight is about to take off, you are unable to pass through the area. Worth avoiding if possible.",-1
2021-11-16,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,OAK is a total dump,False,"  Compared to SFO, SJC, and SMF? OAK is a total dump. Food selection is really poor. The airport closes food vendors, and the walls stay up for years. The terminal is very small. The location, and weather at OAK are good, but that’s it.",-1
2019-06-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,One person helping over 500 people,False,  3 hours at custom check point. That never happened to me before. One person helping over 500 people. Will never go to that airport again for an international flight.,-1
2019-04-29,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,Extremely discourteous,False,  A security agent found some old coffee in a mug in my carry-on and refused to dump it in the garbage can right next to us but made me exit and go all the way through security again. Extremely discourteous. There is no valid security reason to inconvenience someone this way when there is a garbage can right there. They order everyone through in a hurried rush but apparently don't care about increasing traffic and passenger delay by doing this. I tried to submit this complaint to the Oakland airport through its website but (surprise!) complaint messages aren't going through.,-1
2018-11-22,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5.0,will always fly into Oakland over SFO,False,"  If given the choice I will always fly into Oakland over SFO. It's small, efficient, and flights are most of the time on time. With the new BART connector train it's super easy to get to!",1
2018-10-20,0.3,Business,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,"baggage service is deplorable""
",False,  The baggage service for incoming international flights is deplorable. I thought I would try Oakland instead of SFO because it seems like it would be more efficient since it’s 1/8 of the size of San Francisco’s airport. No wonder. I have been through immigration and I’m still waiting for my bag an hour later. How ridiculous. I will never fly into her from internationally again.,-1
2018-10-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,friendly wheelchair assist,True," Extremely friendly wheelchair assist personnel! I am disabled and was being moved from gate to gate and since I had some layover time I decided that I would like to get a snack at one of the fast food shops. The wheelchair assistant not only took me there, but he helped me get my order as well! The people everywhere were friendly. Cleanliness wasn't top grade but adequate.",1
2018-07-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,,Someone wasn't doing their job,True," Flight DI 7073 landed at 4:15 and waited 45 mins for a gate at 5pm. After clearing immigration at 5:15 there were no bags. It as 6pm before we exited the airport - 1:45 after landing! Someone wasn't doing their job. That delay for bags, on top of lack of gate capacity, is unacceptable service. This isn't a one off. Other family members had a similar experience on June 26 for the same flight where they waited 15 minutes for a gate again and weren't allowed to deplane for another 15 minutes due to a backup in the immigration hall. Departing OAK June 8 was another exercise in lack of airport capacity. Check-in took an hour. The gate had people sat on the floor everywhere due to lack of space for the size of the aircraft. OAK isn't equipped to handle the number and size if international flights currently using the airport. There are similar reviews from a year ago. Clearly Oakland Airport management don't care about customer service.",-1
2017-10-27,0.9,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,arrival was amazingly quick,False," We arrived and departed on the BA flight from LGW. Arrival was amazingly quick. It took less than half an hour to deplane, go through passport control and collect bags. Being a Club World passenger undoubtedly helped but even so we were pretty impressed. There was almost no queue to go through security at the time of departure (lunchtime midweek), so the process was painless. Again we were lucky that it was so quiet. A new business lounge has just opened by Gate 8. It's rather small, but has good food choice. Getting to San Francisco is a cinch using the BART connector shuttle to Coliseum and thence onwards to downtown San Francisco. In fact the whole experience is much better than at SFO. And because of the competition between BA and Norwegian fares from the UK are very reasonable at present.",1
2017-10-05,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,they've changed their queuing,False,"  Typically the best airport to travel from in country. I travel out of Oakland 15+ times per year. Today, however, they've changed their queuing and the wait times are 30 minutes plus despite only about 100 people in line. Miultiple agents checking IDS at A-List queue with no one in line. Agents are insulting if asked a question. Is this a sign of Oakland airport taking a turn in the wrong direction? Hope not.",1
2017-09-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,An inefficient process to say the least,False,"  I arrived at Oakland via Norwegian Air from London Gatwick. We were asked to remain in the airplane for an additional 45 mins due after landing to the delays in immigration. When we were finally allowed to deplane we then had an additional hour wait in the queue at immigration. Immigration itself does not make sense, one waits in line to go through the process at the machine and then waits another hour to have an individual stamp the passport. There were 3 officers tending to US citizens and another 3 to tend to non US passports. They need to employ more immigration officials! Oakland is trying to become another hub for SF, but cannot seem to get it right. We landed at 4.15 and received baggage at 6.30! An inefficient process to say the least.",-1
2017-06-10,0.2,Business,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,what is wrong with Oakland?,False,"  Immigration on foreign flights is one of the worst in the whole US, and I have seen lots. Typically, there are 2-5 immigration officers trying to get through a dreamliner with 200+ passengers. Twice, I had to wait 30 mins+ on the airplane, because another plane landed ahead of us, and immigration wanted to process them first. 2-3 hour waits are not unheard of. Please, just employ more immigration officers - what is wrong with Oakland?",-1
