2023-11-01,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,,Shuttle service for rental cars is getting worse,True," 
Shuttle service for rental cars is getting worse and worse by the day. I have been traveling weekly to SMF and I can say the shuttle service has gotten worse by the day in the last six months. It used be couple of minutes wait to now it is over 20 minutes of wait with 100s of passengers waiting in shuttle line. At this point, I am seriously not renting car from the airport and just catch Uber ride to downtown rental agencies and it would be cheaper and faster.",-1
2023-06-02,0.3,Business,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,Worst shuttle service ever,False,  Plan on waiting 50 minutes for the rental car shuttle from terminal B or use airlines that fly out of terminal A. Worst shuttle service ever out of Terminal B. Tons of business travelers needing to get to rental cars and the wait is inconsiderate to those of us who use the airport for work.,1
2023-05-03,0.4,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,worst airport to arrive with luggage,True,  This is the worst airport to arrive with luggage. The airport is tiny and they managed to take more than an hour to start releasing our luggage. It is absolutely the worst airport in Northern California,-1
2022-02-05,0.4,Business,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,Budget lots more time for this airport,False,"  Budget lots more time for this airport, horribly inefficient. Taking the more difficult option of public transport (rental cars, etc.) is penalized by drop-off area furthest from each terminal. Rental car center requires dragging bags across lots, through building and then long wait on huge bus, only to be dropped off on outer land furthest from check-in! Maddening. If you miss turn-off to your terminal (no sign, only colors) be prepared for long delay as you drive miles to other terminal and terminal return. Why a smallish regional airport needs to be spread out over miles of terminal is difficult to comprehend. It’s one thing to have to significant transfer between terminals at London Heathrow (giant airport in urban area) it’s quite another at small regional. How about putting terminals together and allow passengers to access them without driving all over god’s green earth. Sorry for the rant but dragging heavy bags for 20 minutes at 5am needlessly requires some decompression.",-1
2021-11-13,0.2,Business,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,Worst airport in a decade,True," Worst airport in a decade. The gas station on the drive in is great, but getting out was awful. No signs! And dark red Jersey barriers in the middle of the road impossible to see which is bad cause 3 of us were driving around trying to find an exit. No signs. Then one tiny sign across the road, no lighting to direct you to the airport. Can’t see in dark and fog. Drove the wrong way, it is a two mile trip to a dead end to get back to the airport. Signs to rental cars as bad. Can’t see in fog which is common this time of year. Another 2 mile misdirection. Rental rental requires a bus. Train to terminal B ok but just be warned. Marginal food choices. Coffee stand closed at 07.00! I have been in 3rd world countries with better quality. Take extra time. Be warned!",-1

Every time I fly from this airport I have an issue! for both Domestic or International flights!",-1
2021-09-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive,False,"  I’m writing after multiple negative experiences with Sacramento Airport’s traffic operations staff (SMF Operations). They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive. I understand the importance of controlling traffic relative to departures and arrivals, however, it is unacceptable and unnecessary for these employees to be as rude and aggressive as they consistently are. I am wondering if these persons are hired with afore knowledge of their inability to perform their duties without any public service etiquette at all. I would rather travel to the South Bay Area to fly than to fly out of local Sac International in order to avoid having any encounters with these employees whatsoever. I do not appreciate being verbally assaulted by these employees and this is something that definitely should be addressed and changed.",-1
2020-07-06,0.8,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,,Easy to Navigate airport,True,  Easy to Navigate airport with a simple layout. Not many restaurants/food places were open due to COVID. Tons of seating available. Easy train connection between check in area and gate area. Extremely short security lines.,1
2019-12-14,0.1,Business,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,3.0,a very trying time getting out of Sacramento,False,"  What a horrible experience. Rental car shuttle line had hundreds in line. Took forever to board. Bus driver was singing and doing hand gestures, I felt unsafe. At airport security, TSA had a hundred people in line. Meanwhile 5 agents and a dog are standing around at the front of the line. The young agent ordering us through the xray took lessons on TV from a nazi program. Overall, a very trying time getting out of Sacramento.",-1
