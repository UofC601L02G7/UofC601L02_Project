2024-07-14,0.2,Family Leisure,5,4,5.0,4,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,stores at SFO do not have stated prices,False,"   The stores at SFO do not have stated prices for most of the products they sell. We wanted to buy some candies and little presents for family and friends and found out that the choice is very poor for such an airport and a lot of prices were not stated, only savings if you buy two, three or more. The staff at the stores were also very rude when asked for the prices.",-1
2024-04-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,5,,1,0.0,,,1.0,Did not help or direct us,True,  This the worst transition flight I have ever had. Every single worker was absolutely disrespectful and rude. Did not help or direct us in the right direction. If I had the choice I would never come through here again.,-1
2024-04-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,3,1.0,3,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,pathetic excuse for an airport,True,"  A pathetic excuse for an airport. After departures, eating options are limited and to make matters worse, everything shuts at midnight, which is no good if you have a midnight flight that is delayed for 2 hours or longer. The information provided as well was non-existent, other than by Philippine Airlines. San Francisco is supposed to be a global hub, so surely they could afford to make more effort for their passengers in terms of facilities, especially shopping and dining, after midnight. Staff could also be more helpful.",-1
2024-03-01,0.9,Couple Leisure,4,5,5.0,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,“well organized and easy to navigate”,True," This airport is well organized and easy to navigate; it's become one of my favorite airports in the world. On this trip (JFK>SFO>TPE), I flew into and also left from Terminal One, recently renovated, attractive and spacious. It also contains quite a few spaces for relaxation, plus many restaurants and shops. On arrival, my bag arrived before I did. On departure, I checked in at the Interational Terminal, which is connected to Terminal One. Going through security at International was fast and easy. The only negative was that several of the restaurants in Terminal One were closed in the evening.",1
2024-02-11,0.9,Solo Leisure,4,5,5.0,4,0.0,,5.0,5.0,share my exceptional experience,True,"  I am delighted to share my exceptional experience with Officer Lucas at San Francisco International Airport. His assistance in locating my lost phone and guiding me to the correct boarding gate was invaluable. Not only did he ensure I found my belongings, but he also took the time to ensure my well-being before departing. I am sincerely grateful for his kindness and assistance.",1
2023-08-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,5,5.0,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,there was lack of workers,True,"  Horrible. I was late for my transit because the line was huge. I had 2 hours for transit and I was in the middle of the line. Even though I was able to shortcut it and asked people to let me go, when an hour was left before the flight, I couldn’t check in for my flight due to the another line. In both check out and check in areas there was lack of workers! So after I missed my flight, I got new ticket for the next day at 8:45am flight number UA5872. I had to spend more than 10 hours in San Francisco and my airline didn’t provide any accommodation or compensation. I paid from my pocket! This is why I give 3 stars to airport staff and queuing time. Some staff workers were trying to help me, but there was lack of them so they couldn’t do much.",-1
2023-08-18,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,5,1.0,,,1.0,1h30m and nothing is moving,True," We got here with more than 2 hours delay due to weather conditions, landing at 9:30PM. SFO did not plan any crew to take care of the suitcases and we ended up laying down on the floor next to a stopped carousel at the baggage claim. There is no seat here. No vending machine. We heard unclear messages but it's already 1 hour and 30 minutes and nothing is moving. Not serious at all",-1
2023-07-17,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the rudest airport I have encountered,False,"  I am quite disappointed about how I was treated by the ""people with power"" here at SFO, namely immigration officers and employees at security. Perhaps these people have an inflated sense of their own importance, shouting out orders, asking questions in a suspicious tone, and not seeing the need for the most basic politenesses (no ""please"", no ""hi"", no ""thank you"", no smiles). Perhaps it would be good for their employers to remind these people that they are dealing with TRAVELERS, not PRISON INMATES. While I have noticed rudeness at other airports, San Francisco is now the winner - as the rudest airport I have encountered.",-1
2023-01-13,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,4,4.0,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,functional and clean enough,True,"  The airport itself is functional and clean enough for an American airport. The transit is a drag, especially if you're going south, but you can survive. There are some nice (even if overpriced) restaurants as well. One unexpected experience was with the Global Entry program. I had applied to it earlier in 2022 so that I could get enrollment on arrival interview. Instead, the agent told us that they were not offering any interviews at this time and that we should schedule an appointment elsewhere (they seemed to be telling the same thing to everyone else). This seems to contradict what they say on their official website (which lists SFO and no other enrollment centers in the vicinity). I understand there is a surge in applications, but it felt disingenuous for a government agency to be refusing service it is promising to deliver on their official website.",-1
2023-01-10,0.6,Solo Leisure,3,3,4.0,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,Two contrasting experiences,False,"  Two contrasting experiences within two weeks. I was a transit passenger (AKL-SFO-LHR then back again), and knowing that transit doesn't exist at most US airports in the sense that they do at most non-US international hubs, I didn't check in bags but loaded up the hand luggage instead. Thus, I didn't experience the inanity of having to get my luggage and put it back on a conveyor belt landside. On my first trip, it took 65 minutes from disembarkation to clear immigration at 6:45am in the International Terminal, G-Wing. Long queues and few immigration staff on duty. Going back through security into the same wing, the staff were poor. They were shouting at various people who had English as a second language - because that generally works - and giving instructions that contradicted the screens above their heads. (Sample screen message: 'Have your boarding pass and passport ready to show the officer.' Officer: ""Don't show me your ticket!"" Nice one, champ.) I made the mistake of having my passport in my back pocket when I was about to go through the scanner. I realised at the last second, so went to put it in the tray and got full barrels from one chap who clearly hates his job. I acknowledged my error, told him it was an oversight, that I'd just been on a 12-hour flight, and that different airports have different rules. He then started berating an elderly Indian man for putting his shoes in the tray at the wrong angle. Mate, if you do don't have patience for people, get a job where you don't have to deal with them. On the way back, totally different: eight minutes from disembarkation to clearing immigration, lots of desks open at noon, friendly and helpful staff. Within the G-wing, there's an outdoor area with not much of a view, but which affords a good burst of fresh air, which is nice when you're on a plane or in an airport for 30-odd hours. I had a 10-hour layover on the way back and liked the big chairs. Got some good sleep in them. Shops were fine: typically overpriced but it's an airport so you'd expect no less. Landside, before security, there's some pretty cool yesteryear display cabinets, showing menus and service on flights in the 70s and 80s, and some pretty interesting art / design displays too. Signage seemed straightforward enough to me. Showers / nap rooms were extortionate. You need a mortgage. In the past, I've done all I can to avoid transiting through the US. Hong Kong, Tokyo, or Singapore are much more straightforward and amenable, but when I booked the flights, HKG and Tokyo were still closed, and Singapore Airlines were a bit expensive. Nothing about SFO would make me favour it over those other three, but I'd recommend it over LAX as an international transit airport.",1
2022-11-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,4,,1,0.0,,,1.0,improve your signage in the terminal,False,"  My 83 year old mother and I flew into SF Airport from a vacation in Puerto Vallarta, on our way home to Seattle. As it was our first port of entry we had to go through customs. Other than the rude and curt attendants organizing the lines, the customs process went pretty smoothly. Then the chaos ensued. We picked up our luggage and from there we had a very challenging time trying to figure out where to go next. There was virtually no signage about where to go or what to do. There was a baggage recheck station, staffed by a nice enough young man who had no clue where we should go or what we should do (and told us the exact opposite train to take to get to the Alaska terminal). Every person we asked gave us a different answer. We finally managed to get to the terminal that houses Alaska Airlines. We were told by one ""helpful"" airport personnel that we were already too late for our flight. We decided to try anyway. The Alaska assistance person said we had two minutes to get through TSA and board our flight to Seattle. We again decided to go for it. Luckily, I saw a fellow passenger from our first flight also in the TSA line; she said she was also on the Seattle flight and we still had a half hour. Good thing! Both my mother and I had to have every single carry on item go through the scanner twice, including removing her C-Pap, my bluetooth speaker, and my iPad. All had to go through x-ray again, separately. I was patted down. We were the very last people to get on our plane. Luckily, our luggage made it onto the plane, but my mom's suitcase never made it to the carousel in Seattle. If I could give some advice to SFO, please improve your signage in the terminal and on your shuttle train. (The train in Seattle was so clear about next stops, whereas the reader board in SFO gave zero information other than ""arriving."") Some remedial training on airport personnel might be helpful, as well.",-1
2022-10-26,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,went above and beyond for me,True,"  I arrived very tired after a long flight from Ireland. It was difficult for me to use the escalators as I had a very large suitcase and a smaller one plus my duty free, A super nice guy there from the Security helped me navigate the escalators. He actually took my big suitcase from me and showed me where to go to get my connecting flight. He was coming off his break. This was on Saturday 22 October around 4-5 pm. He went above and beyond for me and I just wanted to give him a shout out. Travelling is so difficult these days that to get some assistance like this means a lot.",1
2022-10-07,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,3,0.0,,5.0,4.0,E gate concourse in Terminal 3 is gorgeous,True,"  This review is limited to arrival/departure experience from Terminal 3. The lighting exiting the Terminal and around check in areas is not very bright. Signage and Directions to the Air Tram to Rental Car garage were not very clear. The Air Tram service is very good. On departure from SFO the terminal was very crowded for the peak afternoon travel period. Thanks to TSA-Pre, getting through security was a breeze. The E gate concourse in Terminal 3 is gorgeous. The concourse is wide and brightly lit. The large windows bring in additional light. There is a smattering of eateries and shops. The bathrooms are very clean. Seating is plentiful at the gates with many having power ports. SFO provides free Wi-Fi for all passengers. The Wi-Fi connected easily and is fast.",1
2021-12-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,5,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Everything was outrageously priced,True, The airport leaked. There were buckets everywhere you looked. No place comfortable to sleep if your flight was cancelled. Everything was outrageously priced. I personally would never book a flight to this airport again.,-1
2021-10-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Don’t trust this company,False,"  I arrived at the International Terminal (Hawaiian Airlines) at 10 pm September 6, 2021. I joined the taxi line and eventually was assigned a taxi cab. The driver drove me to my hotel, Aura Hotel in San Bruno on El Camino Drive, a hotel I have stayed in many times. I believe the hotel is 1.3 miles from the airport, but this driver (Hman Taxi Service of Daly City) drove me through back roads alleys and industrial back roads to jack up his price. I remarked to him the ride was far too long and through alleys and dirt roads. He said he was following the directions from Uber! He was a crook and the meter charge was 25.50 plus a $3 tip. I could not find out what the charge should be in advance. However, my taxi ride from the hotel to the same International Terminal only cost $15! Don’t trust this company: Hman Taxi Service.",1
2021-07-24,0.2,Business,2,5,2.0,1,0.0,,,,one of the worst designed airports,False,"  This airport may be attractive and very clean, but is one of the worst designed airports I have ever seen.  Walk from the gates to baggage is extremely long. If you have any mobility issues and don’t use a wheelchair, it will be a real struggle. Once you finally make it to baggage claim, you have to go back upstairs and hope you see the one small sign for rental cars. This is yet another long walk with about half of it being an uphill ramp. Then, the signs are terrible. Nothing indicated rental cars until you get to the escalators. I can’t tell you how many people I saw looking around bewildered, as well as heard complaining about the walk. Follow the signs for the AirTran and take that all the way to the end. I will never fly in or out of this airport again and willing to pick less desirable flights from Oakland or San Jose just to avoid it.",-1
2021-05-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,2,4.0,2,1.0,,2.0,1.0,choose any airport over this one,True,"  If I were you, I would choose any airport over this one. If it's not the weather, it's ""runway renovations"" that cause flight delays for which apparently no one is responsible. For over 20 years, I have disliked this airport - it is dirty, with customer service representatives who apparently hate their job. It has been my only option for a specific sole airline that flies into a small airport north of SF, where my family lives. A couple years ago, I was heading to my family's hometown on a Friday for my husband's memorial service the next morning, where he had spent most of his adult life serving the public (the local service where we lived at the time of his death was for friends at our new home). Soon after my husband's death, due to shock, I had fallen down a ladder and broke my heel. For the trip, I had been recovering for 3 months and still used a cane. My flight to SF was delayed by SF due to weather - a common occurence. My connecting flight from SF to the hometown was delayed over and over on the hour. When I asked a customer service rep about this and explained that I needed to get to my husband's memorial service, he just shrugged. He had no answer whether the flight would go or not. At 11 p.m. that night, I requested wheelchair service to go to the car rental station, and the customer service rep just stared at me and acted like she didn't understand English. I went to a different desk and requested the same thing, then I rented a car to drive 5 1/2 hours to our hometown to make sure I could get to the memorial service. My understanding is that my connector flight never flew there that night. The airline carrier also did not refund me for that leg of the journey. In the most recent case this April, I recently flew the same route to visit family over spring break. On the return trip, SF delayed our takeoff for an hour, causing me to miss the last flight out of SF to my hometown. The reason -- runway renovations. By the time we arrived in SF Airport, there were no customer service reps available, no food available, and the airline customer service rep's only option was to hand me a flyer with an 800 number to reserve a hotel room ""at a discount"" for the night through Roomstorm, whereby I was charged by both Roomstorm for the very expensive hotel reservation as well as the hotel. I would not recommend this airport to anyone. I am thankful that soon the hometown airport will have a different carrier option, with direct flights to and from that completely bypass SF.",-1
2021-04-17,0.7,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,0.0,,,4.0,San Francisco Airport is gorgeous!,True," San Francisco Airport is gorgeous! We anticipated food courts may be closed and brought our dinner with us. We did take a later flight so it was not crowded at all. The only frustration I had was with long-term parking. Domestic long-term was closed with no forewarning, we were directed to international by an employee we could not understand clearly. We were given a ticket to use once we returned, I later noticed it was dated the 8th, we pulled in on the 10th. I had also found a coupon for 2 days free parking, from sfo website that was not honored. Other than that, it was a good experience. Parking is extremely expensive! Next time we will get a ride",1
2021-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1,1.0,,,,there was no food available or open,True, Terrible is all I can say. We landed for our layover after a 5 hour flight and there was no food available or open. There was no food offered on our flight either. We have a layover for 2.5 hours and then another 4 hour flight. Somebody didn’t think this through.,-1
2020-11-29,1.0,Solo Leisure,1,3,,1,0.0,1.0,,1.0,Poorly placed signs with missing information,False,"  Poorly placed signs with missing information. Way too big of an airport with rude staff. Navigating is impossible and for how much we pay and how many rules we have to follow which some honestly make no sense, you would think this airport could offer more than confusing giant art that people can't even admire because they're trying to figure out this labyrinth. Why charge so much, to be treated so badly because of a poor building design. If it were for better employees, better directional tools or at least some correct information instead of being told to, and I quote Delta Air Lines disgraceful employee, ""I should've read the fine print"", maybe I wouldn't be making sure I share this experience with every single option I have, so no one has to be screwed over, after all I went through to get this ticket, like I did. And seeing all the comments on all the forums I've been on so far, doesn't look like I'm alone.",-1
2020-09-16,0.2,Business,4,4,1.0,4,1.0,,5.0,5.0,social distancing is very hard to achieve,True," I disliked this airport after a horrible experience a few years ago but it seems it’s only gotten worse. 70% of restaurants were closed with only limited options available, all of which were fast food or fast casual. This greatly reduced the amount of available seats for those who did need to eat, and therefore social distancing is very hard to achieve. Quite possibly the worst place to spend a layover during Covid!",-1
2020-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,3,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,do not recommend this airport,False," This airport had terrible customer service for the most part. Only few employees were understanding and accommodating. They took away my 74 year old aunt’s wheelchair that she needed when she sat down. Not to mention, one of her escorts left her in a corner for an hour or more. The escorts just displayed terrible customer service. The experience was so horrible for my cousin that she had a complete panic attack and had to run from one end to the other for her stuff. I do not recommend this airport to anyone.",-1
2020-03-21,0.1,Business,1,1,,4,0.0,,,1.0,6ft distance is not honored,True,"  Most personnel has no mask nor gloves and comes really close, not honoring 6ft distance. I m wearing mask and gloves and counter and security is harassing me, i had to go thru security line then back to counter then security line and they openly harassed me, making me wait, not helping, making it difficult, going tru all my stuff and patting me down it took an hour total and i lost my flight. Security is worst because it is without masks and come close to you to pat you down.  I asked they do talking at 6ft distance and then come to pat me and they had no clue what i was talking about. They want to pretend corona doesnt exist. Airport is quite empty but practically nobody wears a mask or gloves and 6ft distance is not honored.",-1
2020-03-10,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,4,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,good WiFi is imperative,True," I have used SFO 8 times a year on average for the last 4 years. The WiFi is often weak or there is no connectivity at all. This is surprising and ironic, given the airport is near the center of most of the largest online tech corporations in the world. Many people using SFO concur with this pattern. I wish someone in charge would get it fixed. A good WiFi is imperative for those traveling through any airport!",-1
2020-02-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,2,1.0,1.0,,1.0,SFO was a terrible experience,False,"  From landing after an international overnight flight to transfer to another flight, SFO was a terrible experience and I will avoid at all costs. TSA customs entry was very poorly stationed, as was re-entry. The food establishments in this airport remain so poor. We are currently waiting in Terminal F with music so loud that we cannot hear gate announcements sitting at our gate. Celebrating Black History Month is wonderful and appropriate. Celebrating with music so loud that jet-lagged passengers get no reprieve and customers have to yell and can’t hear gate announcements is so bizarrely inappropriate. I cannot believe this is allowed and I hope to never return to this airport.",-1
2020-02-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,1,0.0,,,1.0,Very unhelpful and rude,False,"  We arrived from from New Zealand at 6am on 13/01/2020 and needed to catch a connecting flight to New Orleans at 9.30am. At the time we thought this would be ample time to get through customs, pick up our bags and then recheck them in for the domestic flight and go through security again. There were three lines one for US citizens, one that said global and one that said all other passengers. We asked a staff member, which line we should get into, global or other passengers and his response was 'I can't help you.' Very unhelpful and rude. It took nearly 2 and a half hours to get through customs and we had nothing to declare. I would estimate there were about 1000 people needing to get processed and about 5 officials on duty. I felt most for the families with young children as there didn't appear to be any sympathy from the staff and everyone had to wait their turn. Some of these children had been on our flight, which was over 11 hours long. Any request such as changing a babies nappy was met with an annoyed response from staff. There were multiple people who missed flights and as expected were very distressed. When we finally got our turn we asked the guy who processed us, if it was always like this and he said it was worse in summer! If our flight hadn't been delayed 45 minutes, we would have missed it too. They really needed to have more staff on processing people.",-1
2020-01-13,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,,2,0.0,,4.0,,incredibly inefficient immigration,False,  Horrible wait time during immigration after landing into San Francisco from an international flight. Expect 2.5-3.5 hours wait time in line before you pass immigration to get your baggage There were very little staff on duty and the wait/lines were very poorly managed. This is comical for international tourists whose first experiences arriving into Silicon Valley is backward customer service and incredibly inefficient immigration.,-1
2019-12-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,1,0.0,,,1.0,SFO is a disaster,True," Nightmare in the city of SFO. On arrival no wheelchair attendant as requested. I had to push my husband in the wheelchair myself. We went through customs easily with the chair, but when we collected our luggage, I couldn’t handle the luggage and my husband. He rolled himself from the luggage to where United Air collected luggage. We then had to go through TSA again. I inquired about pre-check in TSA and the official directing people yelled at me and because of her strong accent I couldn’t understand her. When I asked her again she just got furious and turned her back on us. We ended up in the non-pre TSA which was a nightmare with all our carry ons and a wheelchair. They took the wheelchair away and made my husband go through a complete search because his arm and hip replacements set off the equipment. Finally we reached the United Gate and they were almost through boarding even though we allowed plenty of time for this transition. We were sent out in the rain to get to our plane to San Luis Obispo. Because of the weather, they needed 8 volunteers to get off the plane for weight reasons. Finally they decided to remove all the baggage so o one had to leave the plane. (Good idea). The plane took off 1.5 hours late. United Air did a good job of Tracking our luggage. It went down to LA and arrived several hours later in San Luis Obispo. When I tried to pick up my luggage in SLO, the clerk at the united counter was the rudest person and of no help. She instructed me to stand by a door and hope someone would help me. It took 20 minutes. A very nice airport employee, arriving for work took pity on me and opened the door that had the luggage. We spent 2 mos. traveling. We were in Frankfurt airport, Rome Airport, Bangkok Airport, Auckland Airport and Tahiti Airport and never had a problem. SFO is a disaster and SLO needs a baggage handler.",-1
2019-12-14,0.1,Family Leisure,3,3,,5,0.0,,,1.0,so humiliating in all aspects,True," 
Today we experienced the worst customer service by the TSA staff. My wife is on crutches and was forced to stand on one leg in the body scanner. I am glad this was amazing to their staff. We repeatedly ask if she could pass through the easier side in which she would be able to use her crutches, but for some reason she was denied the opportunity numerous times. However, once it was my turn to go through (noted I was only 2 people behind my wife) I was pushed to the other side of the metal detector machine instead in which we had ask for my wife to go through. Once the scanner had done its job she was expected to hop with one leg out of the machine since her crutches were being scanned. She was holding up the line, so the TSA tried to assist her by putting hands on her, but obviously my wife couldn’t take the help since she is not able to maneuver without the crutches. This was so humiliating in all aspects. TSA officers need to go through a sensitive and judgement course in which they are thought to be human beings and make better decisions. The supervisor was rude and backed her employe even though she was wrong. She continued to argue that her employee was not aware of the anxiety she was causing my wife, she had a meltdown while being patted down. Until that moment she realized she was in the wrong and contacted customer services to get my wife a wheelchair.",-1
2019-12-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,how behind this airport is,False,"  I had a flight from New Zealand to San Francisco (3:34-6:30) and a connecting flight from San Francisco to Cancun Mexico (8:41-4:54). As soon as we landed I was informed that all check-in bags would need to be picked up and rechecked, sure no problem I thought to myself because I had 2:20 min to spare. I ended up standing in the customs line for a 1:45min. I talked to 3 workers who were ""in charge of managing the lines if I could skip the line ... they said no"" I asked the customs agent if I could cut in line and he says ""sorry not our problem"" Mind you that there were only 2 agents working the whole time. So after already accepting that I missed my flight (boarding time was at 8:05), I get to the baggage area where there were no signs saying where my bag would be because it already been close to 2 hours since we landed. I find my bag thrown in a pile of other suitcases. I get to my airline desk explained the situation and they rebooked my flight .. great! But they made me go through security all over again which ended up costing me another hour to which I barely ended making my rebooked flight by 5 min! If you can avoid this airport at all costs, go to SJC or even Oakland they'll probably take better care of their passengers. It is ridiculous how we do not use computers like many European countries as customs! Very outdated methods that are broken. To make matters worse I wanted to file an actual complaint but they want you to mail it in, instead of emailing a complaint. Just shows how behind this airport is. I thought we were in Silicon Valley!",-1
2019-12-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,2,4.0,3,0.0,,5.0,,airport is not at the level it should be,True, San Francisco is a fantastic city and its airport is not at the level it should be. The queuing time is the most important and performs too poorly. Tops - Wifi is easy to connect and fast - you get your bags fast. Bottoms - Security lines are extremely long (30 to 45 min) - Customs are way too long for visitors (1h to 2h easily).,-1

The ladies at the entrance distribute the guests as they please - even as a priority guest you are put in the longest queue.

The longest time ever to pass the immigration counter - over 2 hours. Many of our co-passengers missed their connection-flights. During our waiting time in the queue most of the people, working at the counters, left their place and didn't come back. Golf-Baggage totally destroyed.",-1
2019-11-11,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,2,3.0,3.0,,2.0,Staff are barely polite,False,"  Third time that I fly to SFO in the past 6-7 months and the experience at arrival and immigration has been consistent, appalling and you can forget your comnection if you don't have a minimum of 2 hours. I am writing this review while in the queue and I have been there for already one hour andmost likely will take as much if not more by the time I clear immigration, this is absolutely unforgiving for an airport like SFO which is meant to be a gateway for tourists and workers in the Silicon Valley. LAX used to be the worse airport on the west coast but SFO is now getting that top spot. Staff are barely polite, the queuing system is at best organised chaos, this is shameful!",-1
2019-09-22,0.9,Solo Leisure,4,3,3.0,4,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Thanks a million for the person who reported it!,True," I arrived in SFO as I did many times in the past, except I lost my passport in the airport this time! After frantically searching for it in vain, with help from SFO Info desk and SFPD Officer, I was extremely lucky in finding it via United Airline and local personnel. It was found outside a security check point, someone picked it up and gave it to local officials and then to United supervisors. As I was walking with Officer Whitney, the local official approached us and asked “Did you lose a passport?” That’s how we found it! Thanks a million for the person who reported it!",1
2019-09-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,,4,0.0,,,1.0,Appalling immigration setup,True," Appalling immigration setup. No attempt by uncaring female observing immigration staff to usher families with babies and toddlers to front of near 100 metre serpentine line of non US travellers. As a transit passenger I spent near 3 hours and made my connection by minutes. Why as a transit traveller with an e-visa did I need my R fingers, R thumb, L fingers, L thumb imaged plus a photo? Never had to endure a pat down top to toe when had a handkerchief in pocket. Had to remove a plastic tooth pick! Man on moon 50 years ago but this chaos. Go to Vancouver airport. All this and bio security via self serve consoles. Through immigration in 5 minutes.",-1

Got into the immigration line at 1:45. 3 hours later we are still not even close to the counter. Still, have to get our bags and clear customs!! Easily the worst experience at an international airport.",-1
2019-08-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,no one is taking control to organize this experience,False,"  Worst airport I have ever been to. Every time I have been here, my flight gets changed, there are no food or drinks stores open after 10pm, they are very disorganized to the point where the flight attendants don’t even know what’s going on. People are everywhere and no one is taking control to organize this experience for others. I am not happy as I have been waiting two extra hours due to no explanation for our flight being delayed. I will not be back.",-1

Poor signage. Completely understaffed and disorganized chaos in the security area. Everything was a complete disaster and took twice as long as it should have.",-1
2019-08-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,,2,0.0,,,2.0,made us wait on the tarmac for 30 minutes,False,  We arrived at 1am in the morning and they made us wait on the tarmac for 30 minutes. When we off the plane the baggage claim area doesn’t show our flight at all and we have no idea which carousel to grab our luggage from. The airport is almost empty at this time and these guys still can’t figure it out.,-1
2019-07-07,0.4,Couple Leisure,2,4,4.0,3,2.0,1.0,5.0,,a total mess,True," The airport, and especially the TSA check, is a total mess. Only a handful of lines open, with people queueing up in their socks (first time I saw a security check with mandatory shoe removal, without providing any sanitary bag to use on the extremely dirty carpet) while the luggages went through the X rays. Unlike in London Heathrow, no passport check before arriving at the gate, so make sure to call in at the check in even if you have already done it and you don't have any checked baggage to drop off, otherwise you will be called at the gate for passport check. The organization is truly terrible. Also the duty free area is pretty poor.",-1
2019-07-01,0.1,Business,1,5,2.0,3,3.0,,3.0,1.0,It was a disorganized mess,False,"  Went through TSA Pre-check line at 10:30 am on a recent Sunday. The wait was over 45 minutes, and we timed people in the regular line getting through in 15 minutes on average. They kept letting all the flight crews go in front (understandable, but why not hold up the 'slow' line instead) and had only two lines open. There were no bins anywhere. If you had keys or a phone in your pocket, you were completely out of luck. My husband had a sweater they made him take off, but it got caught on the conveyor and damaged. Who has run into a baggage scanner which has no bins in use anywhere? If you have a big carry-on, you can put stuff inside - but then that, depending on your bag, means opening up your whole bag on the conveyor belt while they are yelling at you to move it along. I have knee replacements and told them, they sent me through the regular line which beeped of course, then made me go back through the body scanner line, holding others up, and then they had to do a manual search anyway. It was a disorganized mess - the worst security screening we've seen in the past year with about 60 flights in at least 24 airports. Shame on you, SFO!",-1

2019-06-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,,3,0.0,,,1.0,Complete chaos,False,"  An absolute nightmare. After an 11 hour flight we stood in line for passport control for 2 hours 50 minutes. People were passing out, paramedics called to someone. Complete chaos. Thought perhaps it was a one off but later met someone in SF who waited for 3 and a half hours in a similar queue. When we eventually got through no belt info for our flight and found all bags had been taken off the carousel. People missed connecting flights. A complete nightmare - one I never wish to repeat so will avoid SFO in future at all costs.",-1
2019-05-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,5,5.0,5,0.0,,5.0,3.0,Customs was absurdly understaffed,False,"  Customs was absurdly understaffed, and it took my husband almost 2 hours to get through. Being a US citizen, I was in a different line, and got through in under a half hour. We missed our flight because of how slow this line was. It's an utter disgrace to put people through that type of wait time after traveling. There were two agents for that huge line. Even having four agents would have made a huge difference. 8 agents would have cut the wait down to just over what I had, which was plenty. After missing our flight, we spoke to a few different help desks. They were all lovely and helpful, but rather low on correct knowledge. One sent us to a travel agency pretty far away to book a new flight, and when we made it there, there was no staff. They also told us we could go to airline counters to book flights which was incorrect. The best advice the one guy gave me was to not book with cheap airlines because they provide bad/low customer service when things go awry! If you're going to fly through here be prepared for possible long customs waits, and read the info on your airlines website (for instance, that the check in desk closes an hour before the flight even though the gate is 10 minutes away!). I guess, basically, be prepared.",1

This review focuses on Terminal 3, the United Airlines terminal. This is one of the better United terminals, with an interesting art exhibit in the connecting corridor between concourse F and the main terminal lobby. I've also enjoyed the office cubicles that are provided, although I wish there were more. Security lines could be long, particularly in the central one near the Global Services reception.",1
2019-02-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1,0.0,,,1.0,Extremely slow and rude,True," 
Terrible airport staff. Absolute worst experience, no employee knew what they were doing. One employee told me to keep electronics in my bag but once it was scanned, I recieved unnecessary attitude from another employee telling me 'I was told' to remove everything. I spent 1 hour at security check even though the line was very short. Extremely slow and rude. I will not return.",-1
2019-01-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,3,1.0,4,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,It's a travesty,False,"  The Bay Area is the tech capital of the world. Try to find any place to plug your smartphone in for a recharge at this airport! Virtually NO electrical outlets available, and people laying on the floors near them trying to get a quick electrical fix. Even the United Club, their ""upscale"" lounge area, has installed USB connections that are routinely broken. Members are wandering around the lounge looking for their needed juice. ""Free Wi-fi""? Hardly. Antiquated system tries to push advertising into the very very slow connections. And while ATT users get good high speed connections, T-Mobile and Verizon are pretty poor. It's a travesty.",-1
2019-01-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,2,1.0,,,1.0,There didn't seem to be enough officers,False,  I arrived in this airport after completing a 13 hour flight from New Zealand at 6am. It took 90 minutes just to complete a passport check and present my declaration form. After this I needed to collect my bag and deliver it to a transfer point to have it put on the plane to Toronto. Then came the security checks. There didn't seem to be enough officers to assist with this and only one to two lines were open. The staff themselves were extremely rude yelling at us and herding us around. Have never been treated so inhumanely. My home country is Canada. I will never fly through this airport again. Lastly our gate was changed four times before boarding. Very confusing after just completing an overnight flight.,-1
2018-12-02,0.5,Business,2,2,3.0,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,such a creepy airport,True," What I do not understand is why such a great nation like US does not take care enough of their airports and the related infrastructure. San Francisco is such a beautiful city with such a worldwide publicity but it affords such a creepy airport. Let us just ignore the desolate state of the parking houses, the Bart Metro station and the highway connection and focus on the airport facilities. Information screens from 2 decades ago, slow and horrible security check and poor facilities. At least the immigration here is way much better then rest of the country. all in all - so sad!",-1
2018-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,3,1.0,1.0,,1.0,SFO is a terrible airport,False,"  SFO is our home airport and is convenient to where we live so we choose to transit here for flights. That said, SFO is a terrible airport, and if we had a better choice we'd take it instead. Firstly the international terminal is leagues behind its counterparts in most any other city. And as we specifically travel to western Europe and the UK SFO does not compare to any of them overall. Coming back home the differences are so glaring; it's like night and day. SFO's international terminal is so tiny, post security dining is extremely poor. Not to mention expensive. They don't even have a well-stocked newsstand. Worse, however, is the TSA and immigration staff. TSA staff members can be pretty rude and abrasive especially to foreigners I'm sure. We're used to the attitude, but it makes a bad impression. Immigration is either hit or miss mostly the latter. And don't even ask about customs officials. They profile certain races which is not only archaic but unfair. How many times the immigration officials allowed us clearance only to be abruptly stopped near the exits by some Oriental customs official who thinks that because we look like them that we are lying about what we listed on our customs declaration form. We always note down everything we are bringing back & we are always within the monetary limits as well as we do not bring back contraband items. Yet these agents think they are so smart to do this profiling whilst the true perpetrators have been allowed to go. It's time to do away with this third world mentality and if they want to search then they need to do it to everyone and not just the ones they want to profile. So for everything I wish there were a way to rate SFO with minus points. Since that's not possible then a 1 is the best they deserve.",-1
2018-11-30,0.5,Couple Leisure,1,3,5.0,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,totally ineffective staff,False,"  The arrival went well. The departure not so well. The security was an hour, totally ineffective staff! And lack of policy info. It took an hour to go from the entrance (inside) the security lines to get to the security check. Staff took their time, very slowly. Not all the lines were opened? One agent thought it was funny and kept laughing loudly. It made some passengers quite mad. Way to go SFO security! How to escalade a bad situation! Then they took my bag because apparently candles looks like bombs on their screen. Well by the time they looked at my bag guess what would had happened if it was something dangerous? Now why in the information dont you have that pointed candles should be in your checked baggage? Really not impressed by that service!",1
2018-11-15,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,3,4.0,4,0.0,,3.0,3.0,Why no expedited transit?,False,  Why no expedited transit? Arrived in the UCIS hall with 90 minutes before my connecting flight. However I waited in the same hall for the full 90 minutes and then found out I needed another 35 minutes to collect luggage and clear security. I wasn’t the only one to miss their plane in that line. The fact that my flight was over 2 hours late was a sour victory.,1
2018-11-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,"shambolic security lines""
",False,  Absolutely shambolic security lines. Priority queue (which we paid for) was significantly slower than the standard queue. Passengers had to run around fetching baskets because the staff werent bothering. Customers in wheelchairs were squeezed through the queues because no one had the foresight to put in a disabled lane. This also caused a significant delay when a frail passenger was asked made to walk through the scanner when he clearly wasn't able to walk. The worst airport and airport staff I have ever experienced. The BA lounge was nice though.,-1
2018-11-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,3,0.0,,4.0,1.0,Awful service when arriving,False," Awful service when arriving, there was only one person at a kiosk serving around 600 passengers. People who had connecting flights within the hour were simply told it’s not the staffs problem and they have to line up which they estimated could take 3 hours. The airport is incredibly understaffed with no sympathy for any issues they have caused.",-1
2018-10-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1,,,,1.0,avoid at all costs,False,"  Our 11 hour flight was on time but as it took over 3 hours to get through security and through to the baggage hall our taxi had given up and left. We were finger printed twice and herded around the arrival hall like cattle. Fellow travellers missed connecting flights and airport staff were not concerned. When we finally reached the security desk the computer system crashed. Basically there was not enough staff either in the arrivals hall or on the security desks. After a long flight the experience left us with an 'avoid at all costs' attitude towards this airport. As another traveller has written, they don't seem to be able to cope with the volume of customers.",-1
2018-10-15,0.1,Business,2,2,2.0,3,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,30 min to get to our occupied gate,False, Travelled twice through this airport in the last 7 days. Twice we waited more than 30 min to get to our occupied gate. Unacceptable. Not that airport management would care but better resource planning will give you more stars in the future.,-1
2018-09-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,3,2.0,3,2.0,3.0,,1.0,security highly stressful and chaotic,True," Had appalling service from ground staff manning the gate for my United Airlines flight from SFO to SEA. I was one of the last few to board (with 25 minutes to spare before takeoff) and was told by a male staff that they were out of overhead bin space for remaining passengers. I was asked “Will your bag fit under the seat in front of you?” To which I answered “Yes, it’s just clothes.” He then yelled at me and said “I didn’t ask what you had in the bag, I asked if it would fit.” This threw me off guard and I just said yes, but was fuming as I stepped away from the gate. Security was also highly stressful and chaotic, with more shouting from the TSA officers than you would expect in a local fish market. United Lounge was meh. The most substantial item on the menu was chicken noodle soup.",-1
2018-09-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,3,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,dreadful service,False, Dreadful service through immigration. 3.5 hours to get to baggage carousel. Announcements inaudible and no respect or regard for travellers. They don't care if you miss your connection. The TSA are arrogant and ignorant to travelling visitors.,-1
2018-08-14,0.6,Solo Leisure,4,5,4.0,5,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,facilities around the gate were very few,True," I departed from gate A3 International terminal. Security check and other process were smooth. But the facilities around the gate were very few. Few restrooms, 2 vending machines and all out of service. Little and a few duty-free shops. A very long line of passengers waiting to buy a bottle of water from the vending machine but they were all cracked.",1
2018-08-08,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,3,1.0,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"not up to international standards""
",True," Very disappointing as we had a 4 hr wait for our flight. Once through security there were no USB ports to charge phones etc. only the odd socket. The seating was very basic so we lay on the floor to stretch out before our 14 hour flight. The toilet queue was ridiculous as there were no toilets near the actual departure gate downstairs. There was 1 duty free shop and a couple of dining options plus a couple of vending machines. No bookstore or news stand, coffee shops etc. Pre security offered better options but not by much. Flight departure was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. Very basic facilities and not up to international standards.",-1
2018-08-07,0.4,Business,1,4,3.0,3,2.0,3.0,,2.0,airport is clean and tidy,True," The airport is clean and tidy however I had to queue for over 2 hours to go through immigration control which is far too long. There were only between 2 and 3 immigration officers on the desks with room for at least 20. This was a long haul flight and my chauffeur was also kept waiting then for 2.5 hours due to this delay. The Delta business lounge was completely full and was being shaken continuously by something on the roof very loudly. It was also extremely hot. Not a pleasant experience and one i'll try to avoid in the future. For a $10,000 ticket this is not really good enough.",-1
2018-08-02,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,4,,4,0.0,,,,announcements were completely inaudible,True," Further to my review headed ""nowhere near as bad as I was expecting"" published 31 July I want to expand on one remark. When the flight was called it was indeed a scrum - people milling everywhere in no apparent order. The Priority Lane was not accessible without pushing through the crowds (we flew Business Class and were presumably Priority), and announcements were completely inaudible. There must be a better way to organise boarding than this. Apart from this, we found the airport OK, but then again we did have access to a Lounge.",1
2018-08-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,5,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,it is unreliable,False,"  Let me make this short and to the point. I am done with flying in and out of San Francisco because it is unreliable. Flights are delayed and often cancelled by the SFO air traffic control because the airport cannot handle the flights scheduled. If it were a weather issue I would be forgiving but it is not. My departing flight was cancelled so I had to reschedule and fly out of Oakland. When I returned my flight was delayed due to construction and one of the runways was closed. Really! You mean to tell me that with the planned construction there was no pre thought on affecting runway access. It is not just construction, with SFO there is always some excuse why a flight is delayed or cancelled. I am done! There are other choices: Oakland and now San Jose. I have been delayed and cancelled for the last time SFO. Adios!",-1
2018-07-31,0.8,Couple Leisure,5,4,,4,0.0,,,,nowhere near as bad as I was expecting,True," Used San Francisco to depart on July 23. To be honest we found the airport perfectly OK (bearing in mind some of the reviews) but we only used it for departure. Travelled in by BART train from Pioneer - very easy journey even with luggage as the train terminated at International A - and about 3 minutes walk from the BA check in desks. Couldn't be easier. Checked in and got Pre TSA screened which meant through security in not much time at all. Flight was 4 hours away (the second of 2 BA flights) and flying Club Class so used the BA Lounge. The actual International Departure area after security looked quite small but it didn't have the usual hordes of people aimlessly milling about between the fast food outlets, coffee shops, sports bars and departure gates. Also quite wide so gave an airy uncrowded feel, and had some nice seating areas with tables. Probably would have been pretty dull and boring if we weren't using BA's lounge. It did have a couple of restaurants at the very end of the terminal which actually looked very nice with great views of the runways. A real scrum with no apparent order when the flight was called, but all in all nowhere near as bad as I was expecting from the previous reviews.",1
2018-07-27,0.2,Business,3,3,2.0,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,Boring terminal,True," I was surprised that on Terminal G of SFO, after security check, there are only very few shops that were opened, with only Gucci as the international brand, and three restaurants. Boring terminal!",1

",False,"  Every single person I know has had a horrific experience here, but mine began when my flight got delayed 10 times and they would only tell us in only 30 minute incriminates. The food is horrible and the staff are the most unhelpful I have ever experienced. This place is extremely unorganized and everyone seems to be scrambling because their flights are messed up as well. Avoid at all costs.",-1
2018-07-22,0.4,Family Leisure,1,4,4.0,5,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,Sort this out SFO!,False,"  Worst experience I've had in immigration lines. 90 minute delay from getting off plane to exiting immigration/customs. First the automatic scanning of passport was good and fast, but then we waited in a barely moving line as four immigration officers tried to process 1000+ incoming travelers, and proceeded to repeat what the automatic scanning device did (fingerprints and photo). Asked twice why there was such a delay, customer support replied by blaming it one the airlines 'poorly scheduled arrivals'. Eventually immigration staff were increased to 6 people processing the backlog. Sort this out SFO! I'll try to come through Oakland in future. Great to be treated like cattle.",1
2018-06-27,0.4,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,4,0.0,,1.0,,fix your wifi SFO!,False,"  I am currently writing this review on my cell phone instead of my computer because the WiFi is horrendous. I cannot even express how frustrating it is to try to log onto the WiFi upwards of 50 times and get no results. I’m leaving this airport (thank god) and won’t have to experience it any time soon. It is nearly impossible to get internet on a device that doesn’t have cellular because of this WiFi issue. I am extremely unsatisified with my departure (the wifi issue) and my arrival. The airline we flew in with had lost my bag and even though they had it to us pretty fast, it was still very inconvenient. Overall, fix your wifi SFO! It is extremely unprofessional, unexceptable and unnecessarily difficult.",-1
2018-06-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,2,0.0,,,1.0,People backed up back to the gate,True," It took more than 3 Hours through immigration. No one there to ask a question. Since I traveled alone no chance to go to restrooms. When I asked someone to look after my bag for a minute to check with someone to see if there could be anything done to reach my connecting flight, all that I got was someone shouting at me from one of the officers. To picture it: Some flights had arrived in a short sequence, there must been more than 1000 people and there were 4 officers, one of them dealing exclusively with a large number of people using a wheelchair. After that he disappeared. People backed up back to the gate. So if more than 3 hours are not enough to get a connection, then I guess you cannot go through SFO at all. I made it with closing doors, sweating like hell, and wishing I hadn't booked my vacation. I booked business to have a pleasant trip, this did not work. Maybe it is some support for the airlines, so that tickets have to bought twice. So: If visitors with a willing credit card and in good spirit to use it are abosutely not welcome, why not close the border completely? Fortunately the nice people on Hawaii made more than up for it. I doubt I will travel through or to SFO ever again.",-1
2018-05-30,0.4,Couple Leisure,1,1,4.0,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Staff were inefficient and rude,True," Disappointing experience in SFO. Upon arrival, waited close to two hours to exit customs. Now at departure, queue to security was an hour long. Staff were inefficient and rude. Toilets were littered with used seat covers. Shops were limited. Queue for lift to enter departure area was also slow. Nothing to be excited about really, if given a choice, I will never fly out of this airport again. Note to all passengers - Account for a long waiting time and be very early. Airport wifi was spotty. Upon arrival - unable to connect for close to an hour (but I was already queuing for 2 hours at the customs so..). Upon departure, wifi comes on and off. They can work more on signages to inform passengers better - be it security checks or even direction to gates.",-1
2018-05-22,0.3,Family Leisure,3,5,3.0,4,4.0,,3.0,4.0,there is always a delay,False,  Every time we fly into SFO there is always a delay due to traffic. Why does this only ever happen here? Is there a shortage of air traffic controllers? We are to the point of rather flying into Oakland.,-1
2018-05-12,0.6,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,5,0.0,,5.0,3.0,very long queues at immigration,True,"  As usual very long queues at immigration. They seriously need to modify their immigration hall; its too small and cramped for handling so many international arrivals all the time. There are substantial immigration counters but very few staff. The baggage area is also very small and gets crowded because the flights arrive in quick succession but the immigration takes time, so there's a lot of baggage waiting to be collected. Customs is fast and they don't bother you much.",1
2018-05-10,0.1,Business,1,2,,1,0.0,,1.0,1.0,the most disorganised airport,True,"  As a seasoned traveller I am accustomed to arriving at chaotic airports but never in a million years expected to witness such poor customer service / organisation at a US airport! Arrived on A380 flight from London at the same time as an Air France flight. 10 minute walk to passport check not too bad but that is as good as it got! Met by a very rude SFO staff member whom herded us like cattle into the international queue. It was at this point that it dawned on me I was going to be there a while ... a very long while to be precise. 10+ CBP desks all unmanned except ,yep you guessed, 1 CBP to check what I estimated to be at least 400 people in the queue. I counted probably 100 in front of me so unless they were to put more staff on (I counted at least 3 walking around chatting but not on desks) average 2-3 mins per person, I was in the queue for the long haul (pun intended!) There were families with small children in the queue some as young as 2 whose parents seemed to be at their wits end trying to keep them within the confines of the queuing system ......come on SFO airport sort it out so those with very small children and the elderly be given priority it is not on! Anyway after 2 hours in the queue and approx 40 people in front of me somebody took the initiative to open up a few more desks and some 30 mins later I received my stamp and was in the baggage hall. At least I won’t have to wait for my bag to arrive I thought - wrong it had arrived but then they had put the Air France flight on the same carousel mixing everybody’s bags up. As we had all been in immigration so long the bags had been removed from the belts and dotted around the baggage hall. Top tip if you can’t find your suitcase and are told that it has arrived ask to see if any bags had been taken downstairs to make space! As after about 50 minutes that was where I had to gamble on going (have to clear customs to go downstairs with no way back if it is not there) to visually identify it - to summarise disembark the airplane 1700 arrive immigration 1710 walk out of the airport at 2030 makes SFO officially the most disorganised airport I have ever had the displeasure to arrive sprinkle it with unmotivated rude staff really gives such a poor first impression of what is a fantastic city / country which is a shame! Next time I visit it will be OAK or SJC no way will I ever go through SFO again!",-1
2018-04-10,0.3,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,staff indifferent and inefficient,True," We arrived on a full international flight from AKL and landed in SFO to transfer to ORD. It took 2 hours to get through to the domestic terminal. The security staff was indifferent and inefficient. The TSA PRE line was empty and fully staffed. The employees in that area were yawning and indifferent while there was a line of about 200 people going through the only other line. In addition, there were at least 5 other security employees standing idle. However, they chose to have only one person checking passports and only one person managing the security line who was extremely slow. It was the worst security I have ever experienced from both a domestic and international perspective. Unless I am coming to San Francisco the stay, I will try to avoid this airport in the future.",-1
2018-04-09,0.4,Family Leisure,3,3,,1,0.0,,,1.0,complete lack of helpers,True," Barely caught connection: signage, directions and complete lack of helpers, greeters or assistants makes navigation very challenging. Multiple possible trains to change terminals and little guidance on the quickest one. Must go through security again when transferring terminals: real downside. Also our first flight waited 25 minutes for a gate to park. Cut our time way down. I would avoid SFO Airport for connecting flights. They should work harder on user friendliness. (Snarky TSA guy was no help.)",-1
2018-01-12,0.4,Business,4,4,4.0,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,I try to avoid SFO,True," I fly weekly for business, and my client for the past year has been in the San Francisco Bay area - so I've flown into and out of all three Bay Area airports, Oakland, San Jose, and San Francisco. Overall, I would say that SFO has great shopping and dining, is wonderfully decorated, is convenient to drive into and out of - and totally blows at making airplanes land and take off on time. In the past year, I have had a higher percentage of my flights into and out of SFO delayed than at any other airport. When I check FlightAware, in general the other two Bay Area airports will be on-time, while SFO will be delayed. I have been delayed due to fog, winds, air traffic, runway construction and smoke. The most heinous delay was when airport operations decided to ""flip the airport"" - switch which direction traffic would land and take off - which made every airplane on the ground, even ones lined up to take off, have to then taxi around to a different runway. This happened after they closed the boarding door on my flight and put us twenty-sixth in line for take-off and delayed us for over an hour. This was one of the only two times I've ever actually missed a connecting flight. Other than SFO's near-incompetence with their core function, the airport is largely okay. I fly American from Terminal 2, but I go through security at the Delta terminal, Terminal 1, because there are currently only 8 gates in operation there, and I can go through PreCheck in less than 5 minutes, then walk over to T2 inside security. The tram that runs to the rental car facility is rather slow, but does the job fairly stress-free. And, it's fun to look at the jumbo and super-jumbo jets (Airbus 380, that is) that fly internationally. But in general, I try to avoid SFO, especially for departures if I have to make a connection.",-1
2017-12-21,0.1,Business,3,3,,3,0.0,,,1.0,staff were nowhere to be located,True," On 12/19/17, at Gate 66 United. The 140+ Decibel Alarm Rang For Over 30 Minutes at 8.00 am, finally silencing around 8.30 am after the third call by airport personnel. No excuse for forcing passengers to be subjected to dangerous sound levels while staff were nowhere to be located. A complete failure to follow public health sound regulations and codes. A ridiculous amount of damage to the hearing for many. Felt like I was in a greyhound station without an adult attendant. Elderly passengers cringing with hands over ears. A major incident where no-one seems to care.",-1
2017-12-08,0.7,Couple Leisure,3,4,3.0,5,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,"Overall, it's a decent airport",False,"  
SFO is my home airport. I've flown domestically a couple of times out of it, but with the lack of service on domestic airlines, I really don't like flying on US carriers. Thus, my review is a compilation of experiences on both departures and arrivals at SFO over the last six years. My wife and I travel two to three times a year, mostly to Asia to visit her relatives. Most of the TPAC flights we've taken out of SFO have been late night and the security line experience has been quite quick. SFO doesn't use TSA agents. They were allowed to hire contract employees instead and the difference shows, at least in the international security lines. I believe the longest I've taken in a security line is about 15 minutes, and that was for a rare day flight. So departures are typically pretty good. Arrivals have been a different story. We got into the Global Entry system pretty early in the game, back before credit card offers to reimburse the $100 fee were common. We did it after one particularly heinous arrival in which two 380's and a couple of 777's all landed within minutes of each other, coupled with a computer glitch, caused the lines to simply be ridiculous. If you're familiar with the arrivals layout, you know there's a gate way the heck down at the far end of the arrivals hall. That's where the back of the line was. I believe it was 2.5 hours to get through immigration after all was said and done. But even before that, lines were typically about an hour long, even when fewer than the maximum number of flights land simultaneously. Global Entry changed that for us. The last flight we took arrived back in SFO on December 5th at 6.16pm, according to FlightAware. We were in my brother-in-law's car at 6.45 with our baggage. Lounges at SFO are pretty spartan. We have the Priority Pass, and the only lounge that's available in the entire airport, domestic or international, is on the OneWorld (AA) side of international departures. None are in domestic departures. And the international departure area is separated to such an extent that if you go to the OneWorld side and your flight is departing on the Star Alliance side, you have to back out from the secure area and then pass security on the other side. Not a well thought out design. We've also used the United Lounge, and those are pretty universally grim. Signage is good. The food and beverage on the airside, while a little steep (what airport isn't), was pretty decent. While it's possible to get to and from the airport on public transit, I wouldn't recommend it. BART is a pretty poorly run system and security is not exactly their forte, so I would imagine someone with suitcases would be seen as easy pickings. My one experience with the super shuttle was a Zero Dark Thirty ride one morning from our house about 10 miles away. For my wife and I, it was about $20. Overall, it's a decent airport. It won't compare with the Changi's, Incheon's or even Bangkok airports of the world, but it's serviceable and, sadly, it represents one of the better airports in the country.",1
2017-11-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,5,1.0,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"staff totally disrespectful and rude""
",False,"  Arriving into this airport was ridiculous, queues for over an hour, staff totally disrespectful and rude not only to myself but other passengers. Organised chaos, no one had a clue of what they were supposed to be doing and when they did some one else would contradict them! The young lady, I use the word lady very loosely and for the sake of this review, who pulled me to question why I didn't have my papers (another member of staff took my papers before I arrived to a member of staff who was supposed to take the papers) spoke to me like dirt and made myself and another two passengers (who I wasn't travelling with) feel very uncomfortable, very bad attitude, arrogant and curt!",-1
2017-11-16,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,4,,4,0.0,,,2.0,the worst transfer experience,False,"  This has got to be the worst transfer experience I’ve ever had. I only had a 1hr 45min layover. Make sure you have 2.5 hrs or more. The customs alone took about 45 min. I still had to claim my baggage, recheck them and go through security. I mentioned to security that I was late for my next flight and I was transferring. The guy said they don't expedite passengers (and yet many of the good reviews for their airport says they do?) so that’s a complete lie. He nicely suggested I could ask others if I could cut. Here, sadly, it’s common for people to be asking others to cut at security because they are late for their flights. To be fair, so far no staff were rude, just indifferent. But one young guy near the right side security conveyer belts (right before the scanning machine), when I asked him what should I do, grinned and rudely said ""it’s not my problem"". I didn’t have time to get his name. I had only 5 minutes to get to gate 90 (yep, the one at the very end) and had to run with all I had. Once I got to my flight 1 min past the boarding time officially ending, the crew was nice enough to still let me on. Seeing me panting, red-faced and sweating, one guy nodded at me and said “you had to run too?”",-1
2017-11-11,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,most horrible security lines,False,  The most horrible security lines I have experienced since directly after 911. One security lane was open for hundreds of travelers. People missed flights because the TSA personnel would not allow them to go through the TSA precheck line. I will never fly out of SFO again. Would rather fly out of OAK!,-1
2017-10-10,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,4,,1,0.0,,,,!will avoid SFO at all costs,False," We arrived from Toronto at Terminal G and needed to find the departure gate of our connecting flight to Sydney. In Terminal G there were no signs showing departure gates of flights leaving at other terminals. After asking cleaners and security guards we were told we would have to leave the secure area and re-enter in the other terminal. indications to find Terminal A were hard to find and we were advised to use the train. There is a blue and a red line; the red line was not operating and it was a 20 min ride from Terminal G to Terminal A, then we had to go through security which offered no help for connecting passengers, the plane was fully boarded when we arrived at the gate. We ran around 90 min and swore we will avoid SFO at all costs in the future",-1

Over the past 10 days I've landed at this airport twice at around 1.00 am and were informed that our gate was occupied, having to wait about 20 min to be given another gate. People at SFO, please do better planning, you should not keep people waiting on the planes constantly due to your poor planning.",-1
2017-08-09,0.3,Family Leisure,1,4,,1,0.0,,,1.0,There are no signs,False,  Arrived into T1 and needed to transfer to international. There are no signs. Our flight had been delayed so we had very little time to get from T1 to international. It was terrible. Huge security queues. No one to ask for help. Walking down endless long corridors between terminals with no signs not knowing if we were right or wrong. No way of jumping the security queue even though we would have missed our flight had we not skipped the 300+ people in security queue.,-1
2017-07-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,,3,0.0,,4.0,3.0,arrival in international was horrendous,False," Arrival in international was horrendous. Herded through long lines and a feeling of chaos. I'm a citizen and have never waited so long for a stamp in any of the dozens of countries I've travelled - except now my own thanks to San Francisco. It was an hour in line, with equally exhausted and upset people. I looked over and saw the visitor line was 4x longer, meaning they stood for 2 or more hours for a stamp. Welcome to America? Not cool! After finally getting stamped, I was at baggage claim for an hour and a half. Some people 2 hours to get their bags, again, first time ever for me. 2.5 with no water or toilet as a single traveler you don't want to leave baggage area thinking your bag is coming out - but 1.5 hours later it finally does. I felt so embarrassed that this chaos is the very first impress for visitors and I missed 2 airport busses myself. I have no idea what inefficiency is going on at international arrivals but it's really, really bad.",-1
2017-06-14,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,4.0,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,improved markedly,False," We flew from Terminal 3, the base for United's domestic operations. Things have improved markedly at San Francisco over the past couple of years. Terminal 3 has been thoroughly modernized and has many state-of-the-art features. United's clubs, at gate 69 and in the satellite concourse, are both among their better clubs. Check-in is well-spaced and efficient. Security, long a problem for Terminal 3, seems to have been configured to move quickly. We were flying at midday and experienced no wait at TSA Pre-check. As an aside, I'm also familiar with SFO's international concourses. They are among the best in the US, with lots of facilities and efficient boarding areas.",1

The ground floor baggage office, the oversize baggage office, the cleaning staff, the lost and found office and the Qantas desk. Also all the various TSA, police officers and information desk staff. All these people in one way or another were so helpful and never just told me tough luck. There was nothing of particular value in the briefcase, just a lot of items which I collected on my trip, but nevertheless I wanted to keep. It is hard to believe in such a major airport so many people would be so willing to help me. I was especially impressed with the downstairs luggage office in the international terminal who very willingly contacted a staff member who quickly checked the plane and searched it for the briefcase. The lost and found police officer did more than have me fill out a form and quickly confirmed that the briefcase had been found and returned to Qantas.",1
