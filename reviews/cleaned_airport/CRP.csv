2020-11-10,0.1,Family Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,officer patrolling drop off was incredibly rude,False,  The officer patrolling drop off was incredibly rude. I had two large bags and an Infant. My mother carried my daughter in for me while I checked my bag. There was no line so this didn’t take long. The officer started screaming about the truck demanding to know who it belong to and he said it was black so it didn’t register because it’s a deep navy blue. I was being helped at the desk and I said I’m nearly done it will be two seconds and he demanded now. I requested to speak with a supervisor who told me we were both wrong. I will avoid using this airport at all costs moving forward. No one deserves to be treated like that. I didn’t even get an opportunity to give my mother a hug goodbye. He knows who he is.,-1
