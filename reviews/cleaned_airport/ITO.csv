Travelled with carry-on only, so can't comment on baggage. Went in and out with no fuss, (TSA pre-approved). Not much in the way of shopping, but not many people about to shop. Sat and had a qiuet drink whilst waiting for our flight, no rush. It's a bit outdated, but as I said, does what it's supposed to.",1
