2017-02-13,0.9,Solo Leisure,5,4,5,5,4,,5,4,a nice and clean airport,False,  GSO is a very convenient and nice airport. Parking is super convenient right next to the terminal which makes it nice when picking up people. It is a nice and clean airport that I try and fly out of whenever I can. I only wish that I could get more direct flights out of there.,1
