2024-08-17,1.0,Business,5,5,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,"compassionate and dedicated"" ",True,"   I can’t express enough how grateful I am for the exceptional help I received from Hilary, the gate check agent at Spirit Airlines. I was in a complete panic after losing my cell phone at the airport. With no way to contact my family and let them know when I’d be arriving, I was extremely stressed and worried that they’d be concerned about me. Hillary noticed my distress and went above and beyond by offering to let me use her personal phone to send a quick text to my family. Her kindness, thoughtfulness, and willingness to help me in a moment of crisis made all the difference. Thanks to her, I was able to let my family know when to pick me up, and I could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Never did find my phone but there was a silver lining. Hillary truly saved the day for me, and I can’t thank her enough for her generosity. Spirit Airlines is lucky to have such a compassionate and dedicated employee. Thank you, Hillary, for turning a stressful situation into a manageable one. You have no idea how much your help meant to me!",1
2024-07-16,0.4,Couple Leisure,4,1,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,The bathrooms are filthy,True,  This airport is disgusting. The bathrooms are filthy with urine and unworking flush mechanisms. Floors throughout terminal 1 appear to rarely get swept or mopped. Im amazed the airport can pass a foodservice inspection. We ate breakfast at the wendys and the seating areas and tables had spilled drinks and food all around the dining space. Trash overflowing. It seems the cleaning crew are non existent or inept. Avoid this airport at all cost. Tsa was friendly and efficient but the rest is a zero.,-1
2024-06-15,0.5,Couple Leisure,4,3,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,B concourse needs major renovations,True,  Review limited to Terminal 1. Arrived at the D gates. The D concourse appears to have more amenities which appear to have more amenities than the B concourse. The concourse is bright and spacious. Departure was from B concourse. The B concourse has only 2 restaurants and lacks amenities. Slot machines take up most of the space at the gates which makes for a very crowded gate area. I didn't notice any in seat USB and/or power outlets. The B concourse needs major renovations to align it the modern and spacious terminals you see at other airports. There is no lounge at either B or C concourse. Free Airport WiFi is fast. We dined at PGA restaurant. One of the worst meals we've had. Our meals were comped (fish & chips) as it was not up to the restaurant's standards.,1
2024-02-24,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,amazing lady from Flint Michigan,False, God bless the amazing lady from Flint Michigan. I can’t remember her name. I threw my back out the day before my flight. I was hunched over and could barely walk. She got a wheel chair for me and took me though security and all the way to my gate. Waited for my plane and rolled me down the jet bridge. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her kindness! I hope she knows how much she’s appreciated!,1
2023-12-04,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“TSA employees were very rude”,False,  The TSA employees were very rude! TSA Pre Check was closed! The airport is one of most unclean airport’s I have ever visited. Seating at Gate A has no charging ports on the seats. The experience at LAS makes me extremely grateful to go back to my home airport #BNA.,-1
2023-10-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,5,1,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,it was dirty and nasty,True,"   Sitting area is disgusting! Trash under chairs, carpet very dirty and bathroom were not clean. Water was all over the bathroom ladies room and it was dirty and nasty.",-1
2023-07-02,0.3,Family Leisure,3,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,airport seems to hate their customers,False,"  This airport seems to hate their customers. Had a layover for a red eye, never a great situation but this airport is especially terrible between 1 am and 6 am. There aren’t many bathrooms in this airport to begin with, and then they shut down every bathroom in the airport at the same time for cleaning around 2am, so good luck. Need to sleep at the gate? Well, the seats have huge metal arm rests to prevent sleeping, so the gate was full of uncomfortable people trying to sleep upright. Then they have loud rock music playing nonstop. And, on top of that the person driving the floor cleaner up and down the walkway constantly honks the horn on it as she passes the terminal full of people trying to sleep. I get that it needs to be cleaned and there is never a great time for that, but blowing the horn nonstop was unnecessary.",-1
2023-05-13,0.3,Business,1,3,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,worst queues I’ve ever seen,True,"  Terminal 3, wow. The worst queues I’ve ever seen. Just for TSA Pre Check, the line was backed up a quarter of a mile. The regular line was unheard of, there’s no way anyone is making their flights. Something needs to be done to make the security lines more efficient in Terminal 3.",-1
2023-03-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,,"rental car experience a fiasco"" ",False,"  Agree with other reviews rental car experience a fiasco. Embarrassing for City of Las Vegas. Will avoid in future for sure. Long lines for shuttle which took forever to show. Then, of course, further chaos at actual rental counters.",-1
2022-12-11,0.1,Business,1,5,,5.0,0.0,,,,entire rental car experience is hands down the worst in the country,False,"  I travel all over the US. The entire rental car experience at LAS airport is hands down the worst in the country. The shuttle buses take forever to come and they send one of the time every 20 minutes to half an hour with hundreds of people waiting in line, then at the rental car center the lines get even worse. For one of the number one tourist destinations in the country this is absolutely awful and one of the most inefficient clusters at any airport. And today is Sunday, can’t imagine how bad it would be on Friday. This happened the last time I came in November 2022.",-1
2022-11-01,0.5,Business,1,4,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,a less than pleasant experience,False," Slowest baggage claim I have ever encountered. Arrived 11 PM on Southwest in Terminal C. Very poor signage directing which of many carousels our bags would unload on. When I finally located the correct carousel, the switched it. Poor signage directing travelers to appropriate doors (there are many, many doors) for rental cars. No airport staff on hand to assist. No readily sighted baggage service areas if my bags hadn't showed up (and again, no one I could have asked.) All rent a cars are located in a terminal about 15 minutes away. You have to queue for a common bus to take you there. Long wait for busses both arriving and returning to airport. Bus operations staff generally rude and unhelpful. The departure side of the operations was somewhat better but the rental car return was again, not well run. (The airport part of it, not the rental companies themselves, those were fine) good food options. Overall a less than pleasant experience.",-1
2022-07-03,0.3,Business,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,1.0,,They make it as difficult as possible,False,"  I had to pick up my husband after he dropped off a rental car. I've been here before, but apparently the traffic gnomes came and made a huge mess out of everything around here. Forget using your GPS or maps. They make it as difficult as possible. Think I wound up going through Tijuana and back. Not to mention the locals drive like they are going to rearrange your bumper.",-1
2022-05-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,4,3,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,extremely reluctant to ever use LAS again,True,  The catering facilities in the departure lounge of Las Vegas airport on the 28th May 2022 was appalling. There was only one food outlet open selling any food and that was Burger King. All of the others were closed. This was at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon. For such a large and busy airport on memorial weekend it is just not good enough. Can someone from the airport management please explain this. I would be extremely reluctant to ever use LAS again.,-1
2022-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The TSA agents are extremely rude,True," The TSA agents are extremely rude, Bathrooms were not kept up, paper towels all over floor, no toilet paper in stalls. Inadequate seating in waiting area, people having to sit on floor! Terrible airport overall.",-1
2022-04-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,poorly organised airport,False,"  The queues were to long to get in to the country, minimal staff working hour and a half standing in the queue. No where to sit. Got to the front of the queue and the man left for his break, we asked if we were able to join another queue but he shouted and told us to get behind the yellow line. Extremely rude, poorly organised airport.",-1
2022-03-20,0.4,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,there's no reason to treat people that way,False,  Rudest TSA agent I've ever ever encountered. He yelled a profanity at us because we didn't realize our suitcase had to go into a tray. I understand of you're having a bad day and that TSA can be a difficult job but there's no reason to treat people that way.,1
2022-02-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,the least efficient airport in the U.S,False,"  Probably the least efficient airport in the U.S. when it comes to rental car rental and return, and the shuttle transportation from the rental car area to the airport. You do not want to be cutting it close to get to your departure gate if dropping off a rental care here, because they certainly aren't in a hurry and the shuttles are few and far between.",-1
2021-12-29,0.7,Solo Leisure,1,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,There is a taxi problem every time I fly into Las Vegas,False,  Once again a 100+ person taxi line and no cabs. McCarron needs to have at least minimal cab service of some level to meet customer demand. There is a taxi problem every time I fly into Las Vegas.,-1
2021-12-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,1,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,such a disgusting airport,False," In the many flights I have been on I have never seen such a disgusting airport. When I say unclean I mean, you don't even want to put your shoes on the floor. No moving sidewalks were working. All tables and counter space were sticky and had trash everywhere. Bathrooms were so bad that I waited to use the one on the airplane. Due to a delayed flight I sat there for 6hrs and saw 1, I repeat 1, cleaning lady come around and smash the trash down instead of taking it out.",-1
2021-12-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,1,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,4.0,It was a chaotic mess,False,"  I was so disappointed with McCarren Airport on December 6th. Terminal 1 was so over crowded and no one making sure people were wearing mask. It was a chaotic mess. Announcements constantly over the top of each other. Constant gate changes, dirty and broken down woman’s bathroom and overcrowded mess., That terminal created so much stress to everyone. Please, with all the constant traffic through that airport you must do better. I was there on a Monday evening and not a Holliday, could it be worse? It’s a bad experience for customers and I am sure it’s stressful for employees. Way to crowded in all areas and out of control.",-1
2021-10-20,0.8,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,Going through TSA was another story,False,  My husband and I are going to see our grandson in MN. We are 71 and 79 years old. We have not flown in 2 years. We are Pre TSA and are flying Sun Country. The check in for Sun Country was great. Going through TSA was another story. The gentleman at the walk through scanner was very rude. I set the beeper off. I said it was probably my anklet. He said that was not possible. I told him that it had happened before. He told me again that was impossible. I removed my Apple Watch and two bracelets. I then was able to go through the scanner. I felt that he was very rude. I understand there can be frustration when dealing with the public. This is the only recourse that I have to express my unhappiness.,1
2021-10-13,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,security check point is slow,True,"  American Airlines kiosk not work and unacceptable personal for need and slow service in the baggage drop off, security check point is slow and rude personal for family members including kids.",-1
2021-08-17,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,We almost missed our flight due to this,True, My laptop with my 3 cell phones were sent to the back for an additional security check. The second scan didn't produce anything wrong. We almost missed our flight due to this additional scan that was caused by what? It was unnecessary! Maybe the security scan machines are defective and/or need additional cleaning/rebooting?,-1
2021-07-30,0.5,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,the TSA checkpoint was confusing and frustrating,False,"  Going through the TSA checkpoint was confusing and frustrating. The TSA agents kept giving me conflicting instructions. Take off your shoes, you can put your shoes back on if you walked through the K9 area, put your shoes on to walk through the metal detector. It made absolutely no sense and when I acknowledged it I just received blank stares from them. The conveyor belt stopped working because someone’s bag jammed it because the TSA agents failed to tell the person to put their bag in a tray. I watched them watch the person put the bag loose on the conveyor belt and then fail to give them correct instructions. Then as they were trying to fix the jammed conveyor belt a TSA agent came over to where I was and said that it had stopped working because a tray was still in the tray dispenser. I don’t believe this had anything to do with what the problem was, and there were trays sitting in other tray dispensers, but they decided it was the one in front of me that was the problem and gave me stern look. Again, that makes no sense, my tray didn’t jam it. They need to improve their system and communicate better with each other and with people who are traveling because we are not mind readers. I see this happen a lot with incompetent employees, they can easily blame the customer for a problem. In this case it really seemed like the TSA agents were causing problems for themselves. What would a person gain by not following instructions and delaying their travel time at the airport? I felt frustrated enough to write this review, and felt completely validated to see other negative reviews.",-1
2021-07-15,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airport I’ve ever been through,True, This is the worst airport I’ve ever been through. I travel here several times a month for work and have never not had my flight delayed or cancelled.,-1
2021-07-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,3,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,There are no signs anywhere,False,"  Long term parking is ridiculous. You park on International or Domestic side which both lead you to terminal 3 D Gates. We almost missed our flight for departure because the security gate was not open and had no other way to get to gate C. We had all 3 teams to get there. When arriving try to find the Tram but you can only take a shuttle. I asked several people where to get to long term parking and not one person could answer other than leading me to Public parking. Never mentioned a tram. So we wonder around again looking for a way to get to Terminal 3 because we arrived in terminal 1. There are no signs anywhere but on the last elevator by the front door. All the TSA agents were absolutely rude when asked any questions. Not only by us but by anyone around I saw asking them how to get to a location. Get better signage, better way to longer term parking and friendlier staff.",-1
2021-06-25,0.3,Family Leisure,2,1,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,,"Any future trips to Vegas, I'll fly else where and drive in",True," Arrival uneventful with exception of extremely long walk to bag claim. Departure gate c/d TSA security rude when an item was out of spec with rules. Just say ""sir you can take the bottle and dump it and re-screen, or leave the bottle"", all of his attitude wasn't called for. I don't stereotype but this falls right in line with what I would have guessed. I re-screened and passed. Looked at the TSA agent and told him to have a really great day. TSA body scans kids. I know, because they tried to scan mine. Just because shes tall doesn't make her older. Seating areas look like the 1980's. Charging ports in that area are few and far between. The prison gray, white and black color exude such warmth and welcome. Any future trips to Vegas, I'll fly else where and drive in.",-1
2021-05-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,She rudely told me to move on,False,"  Arriving at the Terminal 1 passenger pickup this morning from the cell phone lot, I exited my vehicle and walked to my trunk to open it up. I was immediately approached by the ‘traffic person’ before I even got it open. She rudely told me to move on. I said my friend was approaching but she again told me I needed to move. My friend was approaching my car but this rude woman told me to point her out because she didn’t believe me. There were only three or four people who had finished crossing the walkway. There was no line of cars waiting for anything, in fact there were very few cars there at all, but this woman was determined to make me leave. That’s when my friend stopped with her luggage to put into the trunk. I had been stopped less than two minutes. The woman didn’t leave us even then but continued to be as unpleasant as she could. My friend and I are both in our mid seventies and I hate to think how someone with a disability would be treated. If this is the way you represent Las Vegas to the world we deserve the very worst criticism of all. The attitude of these people should at least attempt to be hospitable if not helpful.",-1
2021-04-26,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,This an obtuse way to treat people,False,"  Get more rental car trams / buses. This an obtuse way to treat people. I have never waited this long to get on a rental car bus either arrival or departure. Absolutely ridiculous! Makes me not want to ever come back here, get it together.",-1
2021-04-06,0.9,Couple Leisure,5,5,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,we were treated like VIP’s by American Airlines,True," When we started our trip in Savannah, GA we had ask for assistance. When we arrived in Las Vegas there was someone waiting at the door with a wheelchair. This employee was excellent! He took us from one terminal to where we were to pickup our luggage. Waited with us for the luggage then took us out side and hailed a cab for us. He also gave us his card so when we return to leave we can call on the way to the airport and they will be waiting for us to get us to the plane. Even though we were basic economy we were treated like VIP’s by American Airlines.",1
2021-03-31,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,LAS is just a really dirty airport overall,True," For such a newly improved airport, McCarran sure is trash! This is the worst practically new airport I've seen anywhere in the world. I don't know what the casino revenues collected in Vegas, or even the airport itself, are going toward, but it sure isn't toward having a meaningfully modern, efficient airport, despite the many years and dollars spent on revitalization. For the pros - 1) Baggage claim was actually efficient. 2) Signage inside the airport was ample. That's about it. As for the cons? 1) There is no efficient means to take a rideshare or taxi, as the wait for either can be over an hour. It took me 40 minutes and I felt lucky compared to the people around me. 2) There's no effective means of public transportation to the Strip and this is considering that the airport is practically on the Strip! Not even a monorail. 3) The terminals have mostly new, though very depressing and uninviting, architecture and design. 4) The terminals were poorly lit, in both the late evening and early morning. 5) I saw a tiny handful of anyone working in the airport who smiled, or who otherwise just didn't look angry. 6) Airline (baggage claim) and security personnel were almost entirely ill-mannered and officious. Not just ""having a stressful morning and need coffee,"" but flat-out rude. 7) Apparently this airport doesn't believe in automated check-in and baggage machines, even though they're chock full of them, Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc. weren't operating theirs, and required their passengers to stand in long lines (of course, if you checked in in advance and have no baggage to claim, this isn't a problem for you). 8) LAS is just a really dirty airport overall, plain and simple. 9) Practically nothing was open in the airport at either 9pm or 6am, I guess this isn't a huge deal to me only because we're still in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that LAS has to interact with a never-ending array of passengers who don't even understand clear airport signage or etiquette, but I would respectfully suggest that LAS look to Salt Lake City (stunning new airport with overall great service) or even Phoenix (which is above-average but not great) as examples of how to operate a respectable airport.",-1
2021-02-27,0.6,Solo Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"rudely, disrespectfully, and unprofessionally approached me",False,"  Ride share pickup area. At 08.00 on February 27, I was dispatched to the rideshare pickup lot to pickup a passenger. Upon arrival, because my vehicle is equipped with a wheel chair rack, which extends three to the rear of vehicle, if I pull my vehicle diagonally into a parking stall I would create a traffic hazard behind me. To be safe without blocking traffic, I pull in parallel to the stall post. Your parking patrol person, rudely, disrespectfully, and unprofessionally approached me and started yelling at me.",1
2020-10-17,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,Food price is too expensive,False,"  Food price is too expensive. One small bottle of orange juice $4.25. Compare with walmart just $1. All fountain water are shut off due to covid19. People has no choice has to buy food and drink with the price that no choice. Government should control and inspect food price at all airports. Why they can control people who rip off merchandise like hand sanitize, glove etc. out there but not at airport's merchandise.",1
2020-10-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Get it together!,False,"  My wife only had a paper copy of her Drivers License. We just got married and booked her flight under her new name. We had no issues flying from Denver they were helpful and professional, but Las Vegas TSA was a mess. They told her to change her surname back to her maiden in order to get through security. She had to go back to Spirit and ask them to change her name on her ticket to match her passport. She had already flown with her new name in their system, but the Spirit staff member was amazing helping her cancel her flight and then re-book it to comply with TSA. Long story short they asked her to travel with a name that is no longer her legal name. She had all the documents needed marriage certificate, new social, new debit cards, new temporary license, and her passport with her maiden name, and her old voided I.D. but it still wasn't enough. Get it together! How does one airport know how to handle this matter efficiently and you guys can't.",-1
2020-09-25,0.3,Family Leisure,2,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,have never seen so much mistreatment on handling people,False,"  My older brother has Autism and the TSA agents kept yelling at him. The first was yelling at him to move up as my brother was walking but I guess it wasn’t fast enough. When my mom said he’s Autistic, he says “well you need to get him and tell him”, she said I was but you keep yelling at us. The canine was out and we had to pair up. My dad was trying to be my brothers partner because he’s afraid of dogs. But the lady TSA agent wasn’t listening because she was yelling at him to go. So because he was hesitant because of the dog the agent with the dog kept yelling at him as well. We (my parents and I) yelled back he’s autistic stop yelling at him. I travel a lot and have never seen so much mistreatment on handling people.",-1
2020-08-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,if you hate your job then quit,False, I know being a TSA agent is probably very difficult but I do follow all the rules and try to be pleasant to you all but when I am treated like a five year old and told to line up against the wall “just like you learned in the first grade” than I get annoyed. Don’t wave me off and say stay here and don’t move! How about being nicer if you hate your job then quit. I would be fired on the spot for being rude to a patient of mine! Find a job that does not let you near people .. have a better day for the agents at gate D,-1
2020-08-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,2,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no social distancing at all in this airport,True," There is no social distancing at all in this airport! I asked an agent for help for the distancing she said it was not her job! This is a dangerous place for your health, masks are not enough, social distancing and washing your hands is the base for the protection of all! It is not that complicated, I saw it applied everywhere else in Vegas. I live here so I know first hand.",-1
2020-06-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,1,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,Stay away,True," This airport is literally dangerous to your health. At least 50 percent of the people are not wearing masks, and indignant about it. Making matters worse the airport is just as packed as it ever was. Stay away.",-1
2020-02-25,1.0,Solo Leisure,4,4,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,went above and beyond for me,False,"  The ground transportation staff at McCarran airport went above and beyond for me. I had dropped my phone in my Uber upon arriving and though I found out quite quickly, the Uber was already gone. Ground transportation personnel called my phone repeatedly until the drivers next customer noticed and they returned my phone before I had to fly. Always get to the airport early, just in case something unexpected happens. Thank you to the wonderful people working in Ground Transportation.",1
2020-02-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,How can an airport be so poorly planned,False,"  Arrived from Mexico and had to walk through 100s of yards, possibly over a mile to get to customs and again after customs only to arrive at the far end of terminal 3. All transportation options were at the other end of the terminal. How can an airport be so poorly planned. At departure a few days later in terminal 1, TSA PreCheck was closed at 6.30 pm on a Sunday? Long line ups at security. Again very long walk to A gates and four moving sidewalks that were not functioning, not one but all four. Give me a break, most third world airports are superior to McCarran.",-1
2020-02-09,1.0,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Las Vegas Airport customer review,False,"  I would like to commend the Staff at the Departure Gate for WestJet at the Las Vegas Airport. I was flying to Vancouver on February 1/20, flight 1789 and had misplaced my passport. When I called the airline directly I was informed that a Passport was required to board the aircraft. I had cleared Security and was already checked in for boarding. The agent at the WestJet Departure Lounge was so helpful and patient. He took my information and identification and called the airline. I did have a copy of my passport with me, which was verified. After 15 minutes I was told I could board the plane to Vancouver and then on to the connecting flight to Kelowna, B.C. I cannot tell you what relief and good news that was. I cannot say enough about the service and handling of this situation by the agent that assisted me.",1
2019-12-26,0.2,Family Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Rude and unprofessional,False,"  Las Vegas - worst TSA experience I have ever had. Rude and unprofessional. I’m all for security, but rummaging through a 13 year olds bag while looking at her and not the contents of her bag which is falling on the floor is awful. They didn’t check anything, not even her eyeglass case. Just tossed everything around and let it fall on the floor. Then took my 17 year olds bag away without explanation to the walkthrough screening out of view, wouldn’t answer where they’d were taking bag, squatted and searched out of our view and sent bag back. My visibly upset, crying, angry daughter was made fun of by TSA so I said that it was wrong to make fun of a kid. He said he was “communicating” with his coworker to see if he was in trouble. Communicating in customer service is asking if coworker needs help. He was just being a mean person. Then the man asked if she wanted to speak to a supervisor, and my daughter said yes. TSA agent simply walked away telling everyone he didn’t know why she was so upset. When my daughter opened her bag, nothing but her underwear was touched (it was on a pocket on side of the bag). It’s despicable and nasty. Grown men bullying teenage girls and their mom. They only stopped when my husband walked into view from around the corner. Disgusting.

2019-11-20,0.7,Business,5,5,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,rule doesn't make sense,False," Got my multitool confiscated at LAS checkpoint. I had flown out of LAS with the same tool not even 5 days before with no problems. TSA was very nice about it, but I still had to throw away a gift from a friend no longer with me. The reason I couldn't have this tool? it had a 2in ""saw"" blade. My question is what am I supposed to do with a 2in sawblade thats going to cause such havoc that I cant bring it with me? Again, TSA was nice, but the rule doesn't make sense.",1
2019-11-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,1,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,Pre TSA is strongly advised here,False,"  Arrival was fine, but going through TSA at this airport was the absolute worst ever. I thought that since it was a smaller airport, it was be easier. Man, was I wrong! We left from the huge Atlanta airport and went through TSA with no problems. At McCarran, the people were rude, we had to stand in front of a machine to be scanned with our legs spread and arms up over our heads. Then we were frisked! Everyone had to do both of those things, not in Atlanta! I also made the mistake of buying a gift of lotion for a friend and it was confiscated! I know that I don't look like a terrorist, but I do know their rules. The woman had absolutely no empathy at all. The lotion was still factory wrapped. What the heck do they do with the things that they confiscate? That lotion was $20. I've never been treated so badly at any airport ever! Pre TSA is strongly advised here.",-1
2019-11-10,0.1,Business,2,3,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the most abusive I have ever experienced,False,"  I have to report that the TSA agents in Las Vegas Airport are the most abusive I have ever experienced. To say they are arrogant, angry, condescending, and very loud would be an understatement. I have never been treated with so little respect while going through security in my life. Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received. I purposely wear a plastic belt to enable easy pass through security but an officer barked at me to remove it. I accidentally left a hotel key in my pocket and this gave me the pleasure of a full body pat down including my crotch and hand swab. My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when I was wearing plastic flip flops. In conclusion I hope this situation with the TSA improves as this experience has left a bad taste in mouth after fun few days in Las Vegas.",-1
2019-11-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Terrible, shameful treatment",False," Visited Las Vegas for the first time recently. Our trip was wonderful, but our experience traveling through this airport ruined it. From the Fox Rental Car shuttle the bad treatment started, and it just got worse. Nearly every 'service' person we dealt with, from the American Airlines check-in, to the shop assistants, TSA, Burger King lady, and nearly every AA representative we were forced to deal with was breathtakingly rude, and sometimes downright bullying. And my husband and I are very polite and patient people. We spent the night in the freezing airport due to AA incompetence and got nothing but hostility from nearly everyone we (politely) approached for help or information. When we were finally put on a plane with the help of one American Airlines employee, I witnessed at least four other passengers being treated terribly for no reason. It's like they are trained to abuse their clients. The icing on the cake was the 2 AA cabin crew members getting into a very loud fight in the back of the plane. The tension on the plane was palpable. I've never experienced this in my life, and suddenly the news reports about passengers flipping out on planes seemed understandable. I'm not surprised, if it happens on American Airlines, and guess what? It would be totally the fault of those employees. Terrible, shameful treatment of their clients. I will never fly AA again, and will never pass through McCarron airport again. Beware!",-1
2019-07-22,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,extremely rude and inconsiderate,False,"  The airport security/police are extremely rude and inconsiderate of any factors that might be slowing you down (in our case a 1 year old who was unwell). While waiting in the line, we were up next and we see this one officer who's just staring at us. While I am used to them signalling us to proceed and seeing nothing from him, I asked if we could. To this he shouts from there ""why are you making things difficult?"". I asked him softly, ""how did we make things difficult for you?. We were waiting for you to let us know if we could proceed"". He angrily responds ""your ID and passes"". We didn't want to take this any further. It seemed to be the normal at Mccarran.",-1

Total of 28 immigration channels, only 6 were staffed. 6 passport scanning machines (2 were out of order) but the airport staff said “they are not working right now” even though 4 showed green serviceable light. I asked another staff why we can’t use the passport scanners and got another answer “There aren’t enough immigration officers”. Well, isn’t that the point? Passengers using the passport scanning machines and having their fingerprints and photos taken, cuts down on the amount of time the immigration officer processes each passenger? Come on Mccarran! You can do better than this!",-1

Way too loud and not necessary. Very upsetting to small children and support animals because of how loud it is. Why do we need all that background noise. If people want music they usually have it on their phones. It is nerve wracking and adds to anxiety. We have to be at the airport for so long, that doesn’t take in delays. Get rid of the blaring music.",1
2019-01-16,0.7,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,very disappointing for this level of airport,True," The airport is a very clean and nice airport but what surprised me and my wife is that this airport does not have hotspot that you can order a Taxi or Uber taxi. Yes it does not have a WiFi connection but only in the main terminal. No phone to order taxi as well. So if you of a need to order a taxi at 3 am as we did, you have to drag your several suitcases with you to the outside parking over a small bridge back to the parking just to find out that there is no internet there so you will not be able to see if your taxi is coming. So the solution is to run between the main terminal to the parking and from the main terminal to the Uber parking, this is a very disappointing for this level of airport, what a shame. The shuttle to rent a car organizes was very rude and did not organize the lineup at all, he was just standing there beside the bus doing nothing and when I said to him that he should do his job he was rude.",-1

Maybe they need a change of leadership or morale team building.",-1

I have to report that the TSA agents in Las Vegas Airport are the worst I have ever experienced. To say they are arrogant, angry, condescending, and very loud would be an understatement. I have never been treated with so little respect while going through security in my life. Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received.

My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when there is no metal in them, but there are only a couple of metal seats to assist in re-shoeing. In conclusion I hope this situation with the TSA improves as this experience has left a bad taste in mouth after a fantastic few days in Las Vegas.",-1
2018-11-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,4,1,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,do not fly into or from Las Vegas,False,"  If you are pregnant and wanting to do a pat down opt out going through security do not fly into or from Las Vegas Airport. You will be harassed. When I asked the first security officer if he could request an opt out he said it will be a long time and you need to ask the guy on the other side of security. Well that is awkward because you have to go through the line to talk to the guy on the other side of security, at every other airport that person is the one to request an opt out. I was finally able to ask him. Disgruntled he requested a female opt out. He told me to wait in a small crowded corner where the floor was covered in trash, as I was wearing no shoes. Later when asked if the opt out was female he said, ""um I think so"". I am currently looking very female and very pregnant. After a while an upset woman waved me over. She was rude in very thing she said. I travel a lot, I've had over 20 pat downs being pregnant and none of them were humiliating at all, let alone this humiliating. She directed me to stand between lines of people getting their stuff on a mat, as she barked what she was doing. As she started explaining the pat down she struggled through every part, rolling her eyes, and being sarcastic. She never told me I was good to get my stuff. She just walked away once the swab was tested. I will be using the Saint George airport from now on, when I need to come to this area. I recommend anyone that would prefer a pat down to do the same.",-1

From check in all the way up to a horrible 65 min TSA. TSA extremely rude unprofessional and untrained. They have no clue of how to properly get persons and items through in a timely manner. This is horrible and I recommend showing up 3 hours early to not miss your flight. This airport needs an adjustment I say restart your TSA they give people a horrible departure experience.,-1
2018-04-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,1,4.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Worst airport experience,False,"  Worst airport experience I’ve ever had, and I’ve spent quite a bit of time in airports. From the obnoxiously rude woman at the Frontier counter to the unorganized, inefficient, demeaning, and harassing TSA agents I was completely shocked that Las Vegas Airport allows these people to represent a city who’s economy is based solely on Tourism. TSA can have a reputation, but the staff of LAS go far above and beyond to berate and belittle travelers, I was astounded by their treatment of a woman in a wheelchair and a man who’s luggage and person was being inspected. I'm embarrassed that these employees get their kicks out of feeling more powerful than airport patrons by being bullies. The airport is dirty and reeks of cigarettes and the design is unfortunate (the closest bathroom to my gate was a good 10 minute walk, only to find out it was closed for cleaning and I had to wander another long hall in the wrong direction while my flight was boarding). I know this is a bit scathing, I had a great time on my trip, but left with a terrible taste in my mouth.",-1

My friend and I are from Texas and we came to Vegas for her 30th birthday. In Texas when you renew your driver's licence they cut the top of it and issue a paper ID. This damn airport has put my friend through hell trying to get to our flight! They frisked her numerous times, searched her carry on luggage few times and all because she has a Texas renewed ID! This place is the worst!",-1
2018-03-31,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,"loud, crowded and uncomfortable""
",True," McCarran International Airport (Las Vegas) is one of the worst airports I have ever had the displeasure of using. Where to begin? The only good thing about this airport is it is very close to the city center. Otherwise, it's loud, crowded and uncomfortable. No matter the hour, loud rock and country music is playing. No place to escape the assault on your senses. People are crowded into gate areas that are too small with inadequate and uncomfortable seating. People are sitting and laying all over like in some post-apocalyptic scene. The rental car shuttle consists of smelly, old diesel buses with rude personnelle that yell out instructions. The food choices consist of over-priced fast food. Once again, inadequate seating in the restaurant areas. Huge lines to everything with more rude people treating passengers like cattle.",-1

2017-07-27,0.5,Couple Leisure,3,2,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,,at how bad the floors were,False,  Arrived on a Thursday about 12-1 pm and the airport was mobbed. Our luggage carousel had three flights of luggage on it from three different cities. On return trip the airport was deserted at 3 pm. My biggest complaint is the men's restrooms on Concourse D were filthy. Some urinals (perhaps 1/3) were out of service. There was an attendant floating around that did not appear to be doing much to improve the situation. I was appalled at how bad the floors were. Wi-Fi had advertising from a financial brokerage frim and I really did not trust it a lot.,1
2017-05-03,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,absolutely unbearable,False," Las Vegas is one of the worst airports I've ever been to. The staff are rude, which makes the long lines, perpetual waiting times, trashed bathrooms, and wifi that kicks you off every few minutes absolutely unbearable. My experience was so miserable it makes me want to scream. And thanks a million to the staff member that threw out my lunch! I have been traveling with appropriately sized containers to make sure something like this didn't happen for years, yet now my less than 4 oz container is now more than 4 oz and you want to escort me an hour back in time to the back of the line to keep the container? At the very least the staff that couldn't figure out how to scan my boarding pass and told me I needed to go back across the airport to reprint it could have been more polite (and after protesting, another staff member at least tried the pass and got it to work). Las Vegas Airport, thanks for making me never want to come back to the state. Yes, it was that bad.",-1

Great food, helpful staff (including AA, Spirit, TSA etc) all was very pleasant. Our flight out was cancelled but everyone we encountered did everything possible to make our stay in and out pleasant.

The huge arrivals sign was convenient to show where Arrivals should go, after a 2 storey escalator and one small baggage claim later, we were out of there. When we returned to depart later that week, we turned up one hour early so we had to wait an hour before check-in. Seating was adequate and comfortable. Check-in process was fast and effective. One confusing thing is that I was travelling with a friend and I got exempted for TSA Pre Check. So we had to split lines and Wait for him after security. Overall smooth and efficient. After that we went to a small restaurant the east end of the terminal. Quick bite to eat and was delicious. Gate boarded efficiently and on time. Adequate seating while waiting for boarding call.
