The main food court has been closed for months. Restrooms are dirty and small. Southwest needs to find a better Midwest hub,-1

Wasn’t even welcomed by the staff entering the airport plus I was trying to get all of the tags on the luggage’s and they just scolded us instead of helping us at the entrance.,-1
2024-01-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,“Always a nightmare”,True," Always a nightmare getting bags from baggage claim. I've never waited lass than 45 minutes for my bag, and usually it's at least an hour. Also, not enough seating. So many people have to stand or not on the ground while waiting for their plane. Absolute worst airport.",-1
2023-10-02,0.9,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,the true spirit of customer service,True,"  I recently had an unforgettable experience at the St. Louis airport that I felt compelled to share. It's not often that you encounter such exceptional customer service and genuine compassion in the service industry, but my encounter with two outstanding Huntleigh USA Corporation employees truly left me in awe. I found myself in a predicament when I was running late due to an unfortunate accident. Time was against me, and I was beginning to feel the stress and anxiety that comes with the fear of missing an important event. That's when Arlando Bolden and his colleague came to the rescue, turning my stressful situation into a heartwarming display of care and professionalism. Despite our best efforts, we arrived at our destination just a few minutes late. At this point, I had resigned myself to the possibility of missing my commitment, but Arlando and his coworker had other plans. They went above and beyond to ensure that I could still reach my destination. First and foremost, they helped me with the necessary arrangements, taking into consideration my convenience. This act of kindness was a relief in itself, but what truly touched me was their willingness to guide me personally. They recognized that my nerves were getting the better of me, and their calming presence made all the difference. Arlando Bolden deserves special recognition for his outstanding service and compassion. His dedication to his job and the well-being of customers is commendable. He was not just a helping hand but a beacon of support during a stressful moment. I am incredibly grateful to Arlando and his coworker for going the extra mile to ensure that I made it to my destination smoothly. Their actions exemplify the exceptional service that Huntleigh USA Corporation is known for, and I cannot thank them enough for their kindness. Huntleigh USA Corporation has earned my utmost respect and gratitude through this experience. They proved that they care deeply about their customers and are willing to do whatever it takes to make their journeys as pleasant as possible. I wholeheartedly recommend Huntleigh USA Corporation to anyone seeking reliable, compassionate, and customer-centric service. Thank you, Arlando Bolden, and your colleague, for restoring my faith in the kindness of strangers and for demonstrating the true spirit of customer service.",1
2023-09-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,Security was a joke,False,"  Probably the best example of ""afraid to lay off useless people"" I've seen in any airport. The check-in line for Southwest had to be a hundred people long with what appeared to be enough employees to shorten the line considerably. But no, they just stand around talking to each other with the occasional barking of doing everything yourself. Security was a joke, nobody around to tell you what to take out and leave in the bag - until after it's gone through the X-ray machine, then they tell you and call you back. Great examples of ""not my job"".",-1
2023-06-16,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,wish I could avoid this airport,False, What a horrible airport. In all of my years traveling for business I have never seen such a disorganized mess of an airport. Security line literally out the door. No one seemed to know what was going on. TSA was terrible. I wish I could avoid this airport. If it wasn’t for work I would never fly here again. Stay away.,-1
2023-05-26,0.9,Solo Leisure,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,one of the smoothest travel experiences,False,"  I travel frequently both internationally and domestically, and St Louis Airport provided one of the smoothest travel experiences I have had to date. Staff were efficient and seemed to actually care about their jobs, food and beverage options were plentiful, and the terminal was easy to navigate. The security process was also extremely efficient and well-staffed. The only negative thing I have to say about this airport is that the seating areas at the gates could have been cleaner, as chairs had dirt and particles of who knows what all over and in between them. However, not all of the seating was like this, and it didn't bother me as there were many cafes and bars to hang out in. Overall one of the better airports I have been through, and I have been through countless. Great job STL!",1
2022-12-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,couldn’t be bothered to do his job,True,"  I have never been so angry. Because the security guard at the terminal two arrivals area couldn’t be bothered to do his job and manage traffic, people were parking and staying in spots long before their family arrived. This led to such a long line behind them that it took over an hour for my daughter to get through to pick me up. There was plenty of space at pick-up, but nobody could get through the single file line because of the idiots parking rather than driving around again. Had the guard just done his job it would have been fine.",-1
2021-12-29,0.4,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,I’ve defiantly seen better,True," The C gates shops/restaurants offered very little to no vegan food options. I always eat a fruit or veggie tray when I fly but this was not available here. The bathrooms and gate area floors were dirty, anywhere that sold food had a very long line because multiple shops/stalls were closed. Headphones I was looking to purchase were marked for $149 here when on Amazon they are selling for $89. Not my worst airport experience but I’ve defiantly seen better.",-1
2021-12-14,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,5.0,I have to say it was the only time it was this bad,True," I was stopped for ""random"" search. The palm swipes rejected and had to call woman for ""body search"" (outside of clothes search). It took 20 minutes to get a woman over there and no one was explaining anything. So you are sitting there barefooted, no sweater, purse, phone, etc. as every single person goes by you. Very degrading. It was a little odd also that 2 more women my age (behind me about 10 people in line) as well was also stopped. They must have passed the palm swipe. I have been in this airport for 20 years and I have to say it was the only time it was this bad. It was the employees I encountered.",-1
2021-09-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,1.0,Where is the consistency?,True," While going through TSA they took my scissors. Tiny scissors I had had for years, that I was specifically told to buy for TSA approval. I crochet on planes as a stress/anxiety relief/distraction. These scissors have literally made it through years of TSA agents. From LAX to O'Hare, from PDX to LGB, JFK to McCarran.. Every other airport and TSA has either said nothing at all, or said they were fine. But for some reason St. Louis said they were not allowed? Where is the consistency?",-1
2021-09-18,0.1,Business,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,It seemed to be more about harassing the customers than safety anymore,True," I checked a bag for my flight home and the guy at the counter handed me my claim ticket, no smile, no gate info, no “thank you” or “have a good flight”. So I looked at my phone to see my boarding pass with the gate #, and he angrily said “go”! I thought maybe somebody had come and was waiting, but nobody was behind me. I just said “thank you for your help”. Then I get to security. The lady who checked my boarding pass and ID was nice compared to the baggage check staff member and the grumpy one pushing bags into the X ray machine. She had something nasty to say about everyone ahead of me as she tuned to put the trays back. A man 2 people in front of me got reprimanded for not pushing his stuff through. “That is your responsibility sir, not mine”, then she muttered “idiot” as she turned to put a tray back. The lady in front of me put her backpack in a tray and she pulled it out, yelled something at her, and said “what is wrong with you people, you got a bag you put it on with no tray! Sheeesh”. I put my bag on the rollers—and she grabbed a tray to put it in to send through. Then she told me to go to the line for the X-ray (of me), where I was asked to remove my shoes, my glasses, my Fitbit, my necklace (not an easy task with arthritis, but not only would nobody help, they were really impatient with the time it took me to get it off) and my scarf. I have never been asked to remove that much before as I have TSA precheck (they have you carry a card to let TSA know, but they took it away with my shoes so I didn’t have it for every time I had to take another piece of clothing off, but it’s but it didn’t matter to them.). They complained that I didn’t get out of the way fast enough when I had to go back. It seemed to be more about harassing the customers than safety anymore. Anyway, I have more to say, but I need to get home and at least my flight is on time. Just don’t go here if you don’t have to!",-1
2021-04-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,She was a very intentionally mean person,False,"  TSA female employee found that an item I was hand carrying could not go through. I explained that I had just purchased the item and the box was not yet open. It was a snow globe from Cracker Barrel and the liquid was causing a problem. She told me to unpack some things and repack the box into my largest bag then check it through. As my husband and I started to do this she became very rude, telling us that her station was closed and that we had to immediately remove the bags. When I asked her where we were supposed to go, she picked up the suitcase and dropped it onto a green bench. When my husband zipped it shut she grabbed the bag and walked off. I followed and she dropped it just outside of the Security area and stormed off. I took it to baggage check and came back through Security where thank goodness she ignored me. She was a very intentionally mean person and offered no explanations. Maybe she assumed that we all check bags through but I don't and had no plans to.",-1

Then, when they came out and we picked up our luggage at the bag return the pull handles on both mine and my wife's luggage had some kind of goop on them, smelled like green apple. I smelled this in the bag return area before we got our bags too, has anyone else traveled and had the same experience? It was weird and it's bothering me! Is this some sort of TSA thing?",1
2020-01-31,0.1,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Rude and inefficient,True," Rude and inefficient - counter attendant with Delta told us we each needed to hand her our own ID and boarding pass so she wouldn’t get confused and sent our luggage to the wrong destination. She then proceeded to give my ID and boarding pass to another passenger. Dirty and incompetent - restaurant (Starbucks), I ordered a lower temp coffee and it was made even hotter than normal - I couldn’t hold it in my bare hand even with a cup sleeve. Toilet cleaning staff was just rude - she is standing outside bathroom - three toilets in bathroom and none had been flushed, tissue on floor. I walk in, flush toilet, take care of business and flush. When I walk out of stall she is waiting to go in. She grumbles and flushes toilet and sprays down stall and then walks out and leaves other stalls dirty.",-1

I stepped back to hug my parents goodbye and she rudely refused me to get back in line with my husband who had my bag. She was extra loud and seemed to abuse her power while I had tears in my eyes. She was overly disrespectful to me and my family. I'm looking for a way to get in touch with her supervisor. Unfortunately, she was not wearing a name tag, she was not TSA. Thank goodness for options in other airports. I don't want to be treated like that again.",-1
2019-07-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,Very bad experience,False,"  Incredibly rude TSA agent—I went through the TSA check line, my baggage had to be checked, but was held back for items to be checked. The agent spoke to me like I was dirt under her feet, then took her time searching through my bag—taking out each piece of underwear and opening all container—being slow on purpose. Very bad experience. I was here for my dad’s funeral and she handled the items I had from his home poorly. Glad I won’t ever have to go back through this airport ever again.",-1
2019-06-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,rude uncourteous behaviour,True, The TSA review process is haphazard and not very kind. The agents scold the passengers and talk to them like they are cattle. Manhandling people and their luggage. Very rude uncourteous behavior.,-1
2019-01-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,irritate their customers with noise,False,  This airport is extremely annoying because they blast the volume of network television through speakers constantly. Don't they know that some commuters are tired and that airports are already noisy? Don't they know that air travel is expensive? It seems that they are wasting money on electricity to irritate their customers with noise. It's part of the reason your ticket was so expensive: this blatant waste of money. I even asked a handful of employees about it. All of them agreed that the TV noise is a constant stressful nuisance and a detriment to their focus and ability to do their jobs and stay alert. Whoever off on this should be terminated. It's so obviously ridiculous and stupid as to be unforgivable.,-1
2018-10-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,"very upset and disappointed""
",True," TSA stopped me and my husband for the amount of 3 oz bottles in my husbands carry on bag. They told him he could not take the 3 oz. bottle of shampoo and conditioner (which was mine) through security, meaning it would have to be thrown away. Now, that's not what makes me most mad, I was most upset because the TSA agent snatched it out of my hand when I asked if I could put it in my bag, or whether he wanted me to throw it away. This was such a rude and ignorant gesture. The agent could've given us an alternative or been a little nicer when handling the issue. He was treating us terribly, when in fact, we are a military family traveling for leisure. I'm very upset and disappointed with St. Louis!",-1
2018-10-02,0.6,Business,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,"lack of decent food options""
",False,"  
I like this airport. It's very clean and has friendly people. But it's really dragged down by the lack of decent food options in concourse C. With flights not serving meals, a traveler can come into the airport famished, with a short layover, and there's nothing. The only place to get a decent comfortable table is Chili's and the food there is simply awful. Plus the staff seem to find the back row of tables by the work station a great place to hang out and share raucous jokes. With five or six of them going at it on my last trip, you could hear them all down the concourse. Trying to pass a quiet hour with my laptop was wrecked by the noise, like being next to a tailgate party. And here's some feedback for the Chili's people. When I was there none of the shouting parties were watching the tables while we customers were craning our necks trying to get menus or drinks or whatever. I couldn't figure out why there were so many employees doing nothing except having fun in mid afternoon when there were very few customers, the cooks were making the food and the bartender was handling the bar. Just one waiter finally started handling tables and while he was very nice he forgot my silverware and water - separate trips for both - and seemed shaky on the whole process. The manager, whom I met briefly, seemed to have no clue that a restaurant, even Chili's, is supposed to serve customers, not double as a social club for staff. As a former restaurant owner, I ranked him as worthless. Anyway, we desperately need a pleasant place to sit with at least decent food that's not just tasteless Chili's fare, liquids, bready pre-made sandwiches or sugary pastries.",1
2018-10-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,behind the times,False,"  TSA at St Louis airport is behind the times. I have flown through many airports and TSA precheck barely applies. This used to be a great airport, but now I will only fly out when absolutley necessary. Laptops in carry ons? Seems to be at the agents discretion, and he is stuck in September 12, 2001.",-1
2018-04-11,1.0,Business,5.0,4.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,really appreciated her help,True,"  Alyce was working in United baggage customer service when I landed in St. Louis with the rest of the Arkansas softball group. United left 11 of our bags at Washington Dulles airport and I needed to file a claim for the missing luggage. Alyce was very patient, kind and helpful in making the claims (we had two reservations) for our group. We were able to retrieve the missing luggage later that night and she helped myself and our charter bus driver load the bags on the luggage cart. Additionally, I lost my wallet between Washington Dulles and United Flight 4749 to STL. When I told her she was willing to help me retrieve it any way possible. She called the hanger to see if it was left on the plane and even found the number for the lost and found at Washington Dulles airport. Although I have not found my wallet, I really appreciated her help.",1
2018-02-15,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"This is just ridiculous""
",False,"  TSA agents need additional training. I told them that I had a knee replacement and have a titanium knee. Instead of having me go through the X-ray, the agent sent me through the walk in which resulted in me being patted down and almost missing my flight to Seattle. This is just ridiculous. They took their time with the pat down and acted like they didn’t care. Just rude and insensitive. Not sure that I will visiting this place again.",-1

2017-09-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,very bad PR work,False," I pulled up to pick up some passengers and did not know where to go. So I then asked security staff at the airport where I should go and the security guard started yelling at me to move the car. I asked him several times that I did not know where to go and he kept yelling at me to move my car. A Saint Louis police officer then approached and started yelling that I need to move or leave the airport. I asked the St Louis police if he could help me and show me where to park, he then yelled saying move your car or we will tow it. As I was leaving the area I noticed the security guard yelling at other people visiting the area. I will not return to this airport, very bad PR work for the Airport.",-1
2017-07-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,time to update your fountains,False,"  I travelled from STL at 4.45 on Thursday, 7/20 to DTW, Gate A2. Please note that the temperature outside when we arrived at the airport was 100+. I brought a bottle to refill with water. Both drinking fountains near the gate were inoperable. I walked further down the terminal and came to 4 other drinking fountains. Nothing but a dribble came out. It was hard enough to get a sip of water but was impossible to fill up a bottle. This is ridiculous and leads me to believe you are forcing me to spend $3 on a bottle of water. It is time to update your fountains, first with ones that work and secondly with the bottle fillers that are offered in most 21st century airports. Secondly, the men's room near gate A2 had 4 soap dispensers none of which had any soap. These issues don't reflect the airport or the city of St Louis in a very good light.",-1
