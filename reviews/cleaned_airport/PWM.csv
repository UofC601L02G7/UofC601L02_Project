2022-06-30,0.6,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,airport feels slightly dated,True," Portland's airport feels slightly dated, not run down by any means, but still pleasant and functional enough. A lot of construction taking place at this time in the check-in area, I guess in an effort to modernize the airport and expand passenger capacity. The terminals themselves, again, are a little dated, but still nice enough and functional. TSA Pre-Check operates smoothly here, even where there are a lot of Pre-Checkers in line. Personnel, whether they're working at check-in, for TSA, in a restaurant, or at the boarding gate, are usually super bubbly, but still professional, helpful and polite. PDX is neither stellar nor bad, it's above-average but with a lot of potential. And, it's better than Sea-Tac!",1
2022-06-23,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,efficient and helpful staff,True,"  A quiet afternoon at PDX. Short queues to get through security with efficient and helpful staff. As the space allocated for security was fairly small, I can imagine at that at busy times there could be problems.",1
2022-06-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,they only had drinks and chips,False,"  We were pressed for time so we didn't stop and eat, our plane was scheduled to leave at 9.15pm. We arrived an hour and 45 minutes early but nothing was open except a place across from gate E11 and they only had drinks and chips. I realize there is a labor shortage but if you look at the chart that depicts the busiest time at this airport 9pm is the busiest. Wouldn't you think that would be the best time to schedule staff?",-1
2020-02-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,should really get their act together,False,"  I used to think the PDX was an ok airport, and after tonight’s security fiasco, I am changing my tune. 10 people got through the security line in 30 mins. She said my neck pillow, which had grains in it, could be explosive. She swabbed it on the outside then took out the sealed insert and swabbed the inner layer. And said “people try and take explosives, it could be explosive” my response was. “It's a neck pillow” if those weren’t allowed to take on flights, then put a sign up! The arrogance of the TSA staff is ridiculous. 30 minutes to let through 10 people! The two families with small children in front of me are not security risks. They’re now super stressed out single moms! Because you took apart all of their children’s things and made them wait in a line for no reason. It felt just like they were being mean and literally searching through every persons bags. It was the worst security experience ever, and I’ve flown through JFK and it’s not like the other TSA agents were doing anything, at least 10 of them they were just standing around talking about their weekend. Flying can already be stressful, there’s no need for the drama over neck pillows. It was ridiculous. Portland International Airport should really get their act together and maybe use some more common sense in the hiring of their TSA agents.",-1
2020-01-22,0.9,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,not a bad little place,False,"  This is my local airport and not a bad little place. Yes, at times TSA slows things down to a crawl, but the TSA workers here seem to actually have a sense of pride and a sense of humor. I have a steel hip and this has caused numerous delays in other airports but either they know me by now or they have their collective ish together. Food offerings are decent and the Powell's Bookstore is a great place to grab a book for your flight. My only bummer is that it IS a smaller metro airport and thus fewer international nonstops.",1
2019-12-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,they enjoy menacing people,False," Arrived at the top deck outside the ticketing counters to pick up my college-age daughter (American Airlines Flight 6088) after waiting near the airport to receive a text telling me she was approaching the exit. Airport traffic was light with several empty spaces for cars to pull up to the curb. I had been there no more than 2-3 minutes when a military-looking airport security guard suddenly started pounding on my passenger window. ""Get out of here!"" I rolled down the window to tell him I had waited for notice my passenger was available and he leaned all the way into my car and shouted, ""If it was alright for you to be here, would I be talking to you?"" I pulled my head back so fast I smacked the driver's door. He was completely out of control and shouting as if a major emergency were happening. I sincerely thought he was going to hit me or continue striking my car. I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye and was immediately afraid for her safety. I pulled away as fast as I could so he wouldn't realize she was connected to me. I'm 62 and a small woman. Portland International Airport doesn't deserve all the high ratings. This isn't the first time I've had their airport personnel act like they enjoy menacing people. Whoever trains their security people needs to be trained themselves.",-1
2019-11-27,0.2,Business,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,nothing is open here,True," What is wrong with this place. My flight is leaving at 12.30 am and literally nothing is open here. You can get nothing here after 10pm apparently. Utter nonsense. They call themselves an ""international airport""? Get real-it's a parochial bastion of complete boredom with no libations.",-1
2019-09-23,0.5,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,international arrival system sucks,True,"  The international arrival system sucks. There are about 15 machines to verify your password and to answer customs questions which worked great, but then you get in a very slow moving queue with 2 customs officers to ask the same questions you just answered. Do the math 15 machines then down to two agents guess what happened ... we all got through the machines quickly just to get stuck in a slow moving line for the worthless additional step. Then you grab you luggage and yet another agent only one this time checks your customers and passport again. Then you get on a bus to take you to the main baggage pick up area, why can’t you just walk like the rest of the airport access. And yes there was another line for the bus. Seriously PDX you can do better ... lovely carpet only goes so far.",1
2019-08-06,0.1,Business,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,TSA is horrible at this airport,True,"  TSA is horrible at this airport. I don't hear well, but I'm well versed in the procedures we are forced to go through. Staff kept screaming something at me, I had no idea what, but I knew what was expected so ignored him and was just waiting my turn to go through the screener; he actually grabbed me by the shoulder and pulled me back! I am nearly 70 years old, female, I jerked away and he pulled me back and screamed at me to empty my pockets! I do not have things in my pockets, good grief.  Got to my boarding area, Southwest C12, and sat down to read and wait ... looked down and the metal bar between the seats was covered with filth. It was so thick you could run your fingers through it. So disgusting, I got up and looked for a clean seat, and they were all filthy, so I just got some exercise and walked for two hours. I cannot believe how filthy it was.",-1
2019-05-19,0.2,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,"I hate this airport""
",False,  40 minutes to get through security. 25 in line and then the worst was the arrogant attitude of all TSA when my bag was pulled to be checked - it sat there for 5 minutes. 4 workers stood right there within 3 feet of it talking to each other. After 5 minutes another woman walked nearby and I went to her and said my bag has been there 5 minutes - she had an arrogant attitude as well and said with an annoyed tone - someone will get to it. I waited another 3 minutes - 2 of the 4 talking walked the other direction and 2 still talked a minute or more - I tried to get their attention but was ignored. I saw another man standing around and told him my bag had been there almost 10 minutes - same attitude - “someone will get to it”. With an attitude a minute later a still waiting - I saw a woman who I complained to and she said same thing with an attitude. Meanwhile a TSA man had gone to the next row over and started checking 2 or 3 bags that had come out way after mine - mine was only bag for a full five minutes at least. It took 15 minutes. Rude people that don't care and think they are god because they have so much power over your life and you can’t do anything about it. I hate this airport.,-1
2019-03-29,1.0,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,best airport in the US,False," Every single time I have flown out of Portland it has been amazing. All of the staff are very nice and kind. I usually fly out of Portland on Alaska Airlines which I also think is the best U.S. carrier. It is relatively small and easy to navigate. Has enough seating for everyone on the flight. I once flew in to LAX and we had 3 hours till our next flight and there was no seating, well there was some, but only enough for about 20 passengers. So overall I think Portland International Airport is the best airport in the United States.",1
2018-03-27,0.3,Business,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,is now dropping to the unfavored list,False,"  One side of security check was closed, without notice at main entrance. At the D/E security check, my husband and I were told that our TSA passes on our phones 'could have been photo-shopped' so we'd need to proceed through security as usual - unpacking liquids, toiletries, digital devices, removing our shoes and jackets. This was super unusual and uncalled for. What is the point of paying for the additional service and being frequent travelers if there is no recognition of our ability to comply? Portland, once a favored airport, and our former home airport at that, is now dropping to the unfavored list - akin to San Diego - an airport that we avoid.",-1
2018-03-17,1.0,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,so nice and helpful,True," I fly 3x a year through Portland Airport and the TSA agents were so nice and helpful today that I had to give them props. Thanks for a very pleasant experience! Plus, the security lines were very short. Bonus!",1
2018-01-31,0.6,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,Why do they need to be so rude?,False,"  I have been to this airport many times. It is a very nice, clean and for the most part friendly. But the last few times the TSA has been nothing but rude!We have had one TSA employee shove my son's stuff down the lane making him almost drop his computer and then yell at him because he said ""what the hell?"" Yes he said hell because it surprised him and he is 22. Then the guy got all upset because he said hell and told me he cursed at him when he didn't. The guy wasn't even wearing a uniform or a badge! He was completely rude to me when I asked why he had to shove his stuff down! Even the people around us where talking about how rude he was to my son so I know it wasn't just us. Then we were just at the airport this last weekend and there was a normal size line for security and it was moving fine. We got past the licence check and this little guy was yelling at people to ""Pick a line or I will pick one for you!!"" Everyone was moving fine there was an older lady who was a little slow because of her age and she looked so upset by what he said. Why do they feel they need to be so rude?! There was no reason for him say that even if we were all slow!!  I sure hope my next trip to PDX will be much better. It's always been a friendly airport so I am hoping that's what it will be next time.",1
2016-09-27,1.0,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"a smart, caring design",False," I am not a world traveller but do have quite a bit of experience over my 60 years. I cannot find a better airport than Portland in terms of access, TSA service, parking, car rental, and restaurants. It is small enough to have that hometown feeling unlike LAX or SFO yet large enough that you will notice the long lines at peak periods. Yet, the TSA seems to be much more responsive and best of all, compassionate in this most painful point of travel. They seem to be able to open new lines, cross cover one another and be cheerful at the same time. Best of PDX is that the provide an area to accommodate families and fiends to greet incoming pax. All other airports just want you to drop off and get out. Here they have stores and restaurants outside of the security where we can meet and greet. I do not recall any other airport like this. Overall, just a smart, caring design that works for me.",1
2016-04-26,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,friendly and courteous,False,"  Portland Airport has got to be one of the best airports in the system, with the sole exception of very long walking distances. Check-in is swift, TSA friendly and courteous, amenities are bountiful and terminal is clean. Food is reasonably priced and close to gates, parking is excellent compared to Chicago's mess. Would highly recommend this airport.",1
