2024-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,This is beyond bad service,True,"  The staff at the airport were by far the worst I have ever experienced. The airline staff made a mistake with my bday so with my ticket could not go through check in after waiting in line. When rushing back from the ticket counter with the right ticket, there were only 10 min left from the final call, so I asked the queuing staff if they could help me, both of them answered with cold voice and poker face: NO! After finally getting to the front of the line by asking favors from 100+ passengers, I told the lady who did my security check that I was terribly late. She’s like: that’s why you need to get here earlier. I explained to her that airplane made a mistake and this was my second time thought the security line. She said with a big smile: looks like not only you were not able to get in the last time, you are not going to get in this time either. You are going to miss your flight. And she said in a way as if she’s super happy that this happened to me. This is beyond bad service, it felt very inhumane. After all, what type of human with basic integrity would do/say things like this to a 6 months pregnant women who’s worried sick.",-1
2024-03-23,0.4,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,Took an hour for us to be processed,True,"  TSA security screening area is in desperate need of improvement. Took an hour for us to be processed. No air conditioning or decent fan system. The single huge fan was pointed directly at agent sitting on his butt, not the dozens of sweltering passengers. Possibly not enough tsa agents. Because “the dog is here,” according to agent, everyone was given precheck. We paid for that convenience, apparently for nothing. Also, we travel through HNL frequently a transferring between mainland and inter island flights is confusing and time consuming. No matter how many times we do it.",-1
2023-08-21,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,4.0,5.0,through the security process comfortably,False," The seats in the Terminal waiting areas are very comfortable. The security process looked ominous at first, but I was constantly moving and when it came time for the scan, I did not have to take off my belt or shoes and got through the security process comfortably. I wish Portland Airport was like that.",1
2023-04-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Do better!,True,"  My travel plans had me taking a Hawaiian airlines flight from Kona to Honolulu and then a Delta flight from Honolulu to Minneapolis, MN. Honolulu airport is not set up for this kind of travel - which I'm sure is not unique. There are no ways to get from Terminal 1 (Hawaiian airlines exclusively) to Terminal 2 (all other airlines) without walking - outside - for 1/2 a mile. This is done while dragging your checked luggage. Once you get to Terminal 2 you then have to make your way to your airline. Delta, to my bad luck, was another 1/2 mile away. My husband was making this trek on a knee scooter so I - somewhat healthier - was dragging 2 checked bags. In the in-flight magazine there was some mention of a Wiki Shuttle but I saw no evidence of that and believe that was only available once you passed security. All other international airports I've been in have some sort of passenger moving system - train, tram, bus, etc. Invest is something! Once at my gate I had to search for a water fountain. Do you realize how many travelers have water bottles to fill. 1 station in the F concourse is not sufficient when most travelers are boarding a 6+ hour flight. Do better!",-1
2023-02-25,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,I found this airport very confusing,False,"  I found this airport very confusing. When we got off from the plane, there is no sign for us to take that shuttle, and nobody was available for us to ask. In the airport, no clear signs for where to get food. The only Elevator signs are outside of gates, and nowhere to be found inside. Oh man. Tell me about how annoying it is running around with a child. Plus no free wifi after 45 mins. It is ridiculous.",-1
2023-02-24,0.3,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,lacking courteous employees,False," This airport is old, inefficiently designed, lacking courteous employees (more interested in chatting with each other). Waited in a line 100 ft long OUTSIDE (I know Hawaii is nice, but that tells you that the line was long!) prior to getting inside the terminal to go through security. They are just lucky that people tolerate this in order to be in Hawaii. I would have given less than a 3 if the guy at Starbucks wasn't so great.",-1
2023-02-08,0.4,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,security personnel are very rude,False,  The security personnel are very rude and use curse words and threaten you when I was picking up my wife. This isn’t the first time since I live in Honolulu. My friends also have encountered such unprofessional behavior from the security to the point they wish to file a police report for vulgar language directed towards them.,-1
2022-11-23,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,The security area is pathetic,False,"  By far one of the worst airports I have ever had to endure. All be it there are signs of improvement being made. The security area is pathetic. Very crowded with no AC and total chaos. I described the checkin area as a giant parkade and that still holds true. Very dark, open area. The food court consists of 4 kiosks with the eating are just outside. Birds flying all over the place and eating from the tables left uncleaned. We have been through this airport since the early 70's and have seen it grow over the years. Maybe it is time for a complete refit.",-1
2022-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Be prepared to sleep outside the airport,False,  Think again before flying into Honolulu If you have a connecting flight that’s over 3-4 hours waiting. Be prepared to sleep outside the airport on concrete while you wait with 50 people around for security to allow back into terminal. Apparently social distancing isn’t a think anymore.,-1
2022-01-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,tops the worst airports,False," Honolulu International Airport tops the worst airports I have ever experienced. After arrival, we had to go through a Covid screening check point which took over 2 hours. The lady at the check point held on to my ID while I had to upload my vaccine card into the Hawaii Safe Travel portal and forgot to give it back to me. Once we passed the secured area I remembered and asked the security guard if I could go back to get my ID. The guard of course didn’t speak English and while I was trying to explain I need to get my ID back from desk #1 which was like 50 feet away, I was yelled at by another security guard to go through the TSA check point again and through the Covid line only to get my ID. I said I don’t have a boarding pass and can’t get through TSA and he said “that’s your problem!” I asked if they could please send someone to get my ID and they said I should go back to delta and ask for a pass to go through TSA which took me in a circle around the airport to get to the Covid screening line. Once at desk #1, the lady who had held my ID, said she had just given it to a security guard and I have to go to their office to get it back. So I had to find where their office was which no one apparently knew where it was, only to get to a desk with two ladies sitting and while I explained my ID should’ve been brought here, they not only didn’t help but started answering phone calls with me still standing behind the desk. I had to ask multiple times for someone to please help me so I could go home and that my husband and dog have been waiting outside for me for hours. I haven’t even mentioned how rude some of the airport staff were and how clueless they were about the airport and how it works. Thai airport system is a disaster. Our experience here was a nightmare and I don’t wish it upon anyone especially after a long flight back home. This needs to get fixed! Travelers shouldn’t be treated like this when they are being charged thousands of dollars to travel and relax. Even LAX operates better and has more knowledgeable and nicer staff.",-1
2021-11-23,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Inefficient and inept,False,  Inefficient and inept. Waiting in lines like at an amusement park to get to baggage. People controlling the flow are either incompetent or don't care. We had to traverse the line three times while others had a straight shot in--and I'm not referring to the active duty personnel and their families. Several people complained when they started allow other general passengers go through but the persons controlling the flow ignored everyone. Be prepared to wait an hour just to get to baggage.,-1
2020-03-19,0.5,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,never look forward to this place,False,"  Concrete monstrosity and mainly a disappointment. Disorderly queues at check-in but fortunately short waiting times for service. Aged TSA infrastructure and again, weak disorderly queues. Really nothing at all interesting in the gate areas and was pleased to join my flight. Baggage came quickly on my return but was pulled over by a clearly bored CBP agent who did a cursory check and sent us on our way - what a waste of time. Can't avoid unfortunately but never look forward to this place.",-1
2020-03-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,no excuse for the condition of this airport,False,  There is no excuse for the condition of this airport. The washrooms are filthy and ancient. The seating and waiting areas are poorly designed and filthy. The check-in attendant at WestJet (Priority) was visibly hostile and unhelpful. No one at this airport was helpful or friendly. Hate their jobs and it is no wonder considering the condition of this airport.,-1
2020-01-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,"Humid, hot, and lacking air-conditioning",False,"  Humid, hot, and lacking air-conditioning. Line for check-in stretched outside the airport. Honestly, I've been to several third-world countries with better airports than this. It's so bad in fact that I would almost consider skipping flying into Oahu all-together.",-1
2019-11-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This airport is complete trash,False,"  I had to get a last minute flight to go to the mainland for a funeral. This airport is complete trash. To be fair, maybe I'm in a bad mood, but I would literally rather fly into or out of any disgusting airport in the world. At least they have beer. Its 10 pm and nothing is open. The bathroom smells like a portable toilet on the third day of a rugby tournament on a hot summer day in Georgia. It's so hot and humid in here that my knees are sweating, not the back of my knees, my kneecaps. I live in Hawaii and I'm used to not having air conditioning, but this would be much more tolerable if you could at least get a beer. Next time I leave, I'll see if I can just be a stowaway on a cargo ship. It would be about as comfortable and wouldnt cost $1000. Oh, I forgot to mention a pigeon decided to relieve himself on my shoulder inside the airport. Keep up the good work, guys!",-1
2019-11-14,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,2.0,5.0,fly any airline but American,False,  This airport is pretty small. American Airlines closes their baggage check counter from 7:30-11:30 and apparently you have to call to get this information or it’s your fault for not having the knowledge like this is common practice. All the airport staff and other airline staffs were helpful. When flying out of this airport I beg you please fly any airline but American Airlines. They seem to be the only airline that has baggage check counters closed. No other airline follows this procedure.,1
2019-10-14,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,inadequate rental car return signage,False,  Totally inadequate rental car return signage! I circled the airport for 30 minutes - about 5 times driving through departures area - following rental return signs that go nowhere! Finally had to drive wrong way through a one way street because I could see the Hertz signs far ahead. Delay caused me to be late for my boarding. Extremely dangerous situation caused simply because airport security or construction personnel couldn’t Ensure rental return signs actually get you to the rental return instead of back to the freeway. SHAME ON HONOLULU AIRPORT. You guys totally suck.,-1
2019-10-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,"each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed",True," What an armpit. I don't know what else to say! Thankfully, the State of Hawaii appears to be finally, slowly moving to revitalize this ancient relic of air travel, but who knows how long that'll take?! I've flown in or out of Honolulu three times, each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed, and it's legitimately hard for me to even think of anything positive to say about this place (as if you couldn't tell already). To elaborate: The layout had to have designed by a third-grader (and that may even be an insult to third-graders), illogical, seemingly lackadaisical, with unnecessarily long walking with little art work and shops along the way. Oh, and poor signage, as you're approaching and leaving the airport and within the airport. The exterior just looks little better than what I imagine a bombed-out set of the show M*A*S*H would've looked like, but at least there are some neat tropical plants here and there. There is no tram, which makes it horrifyingly handicapped-inaccessible to travel between security, terminals and gates. Few airports I've ever been to seem to have more intentionally curt, unpleasant personnel than Honolulu, whether they're check-in and ticketing agents, TSA, customs and immigration, Starbucks baristas, or bartenders. Security is astonishingly slow and ""un-methodically methodical"", even having TSA Pre-Check helps, but just a little. The only perk is the people who are wearing leis, and greet you into Hawaii with smiles as the plane is disembarking. Just avoid this place if you possibly can, it is easily avoidable if you're flying from the Americas or Europe, if you know what you're doing, but probably not avoidable if you're flying from Australasia or Asia.",-1
2019-10-07,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,Absolutely ridiculous,False,  Worst airport I’ve ever been to. I travel constantly for work. It took over two hours and walked miles to get to gate. Then I was bumped because flight was oversold. Absolutely ridiculous.,-1
2019-10-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Needs knocking down and building a new one,False,"  Absolute worst airport ever. Needs knocking down and building a new one. You get out of your taxi etc see a long line which is outside, no idea if you should join it as no staff to ask. Get to the end of the line to find it’s not the right line if you have luggage. Eventually find the right machine get boarding ticket then have to go back to the original line to queue up again for sniffer dog. Then security. Nowhere to sort yourself out when you get through. When you think you are finished another security check for fruit and flowers. Need more and trained staff. Or it needs a big sign to say where to go first. They spend a fortune building hotels and designer shops which has spoiled the place but can’t get a decent airport.",-1
2019-10-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,most disorganized airport,False,"  The most disorganized airport I've ever flown through. I showed up 2 hours before departure for a domestic flight, which is usually plenty of time. It took over an hour to get through security, and I barely made it to the gate for final boarding. The terminal signs outside are unclear. My flight was departing from terminal 1, gate C1. The signs at the curb all showed ""Terminal 1 Gates A & B"", as if C gates are located elsewhere. They aren't, but you wouldn't know that by looking at the signs.",-1
2019-09-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,2.0,waived her finger in my face,True, TSA in this airport was good. However I did have the most interesting encounter with a little angry cleaning lady in the women’s bathroom. She waived her finger in my face while angrily telling me to flush the toilet before I had even used the bathroom. Rude.,-1
2019-09-14,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Disorganised and dirty,False,"  Has been 20 years since my last visit and swear nothing has been updated in that time. Disorganised and dirty, very little signage, very poor food options, closed restrooms, stressful security experience all takes place in dark crowded and dingy spaces. Such a shame as totally does not reflect the amazingly beautiful and friendly Hawaii. Needs complete demo and rebuild sadly.",-1
2019-07-03,0.1,Business,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,a horrible airport,False,"  
This is a horrible airport. It is disorganized and lacks signage. The waiting areas lack outlets to charge cell phones. Security is just rude - my guy was quite thrilled when he found my oversized container of sun spray. I won’t be back soon.",-1
2019-06-12,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,a terrible experience,False,"  Like most reviews mention, the disorganization and overcrowding run rampant at this airport. The Hawaii heat coupled with lines out the door made for a terrible experience. The lack of directional signage pointing us to the rental car return forced us to get back on the freeway and loop around the entire airport again. Of course when we asked a police officer for directions his only response was to follow the signs. But worst of all was the rude and angry TSA agent who yelled at us for no reason. We were traveling with our child and he was adamant that we were hiding something in the stroller. I quote, ""Take that carseat off! I know it comes out!"" After being told by one agent to take our shoes off, the same angry TSA agent yells at us again that we need to keep them on. When I told him we were getting conflicting information, all he did was throw a fit. Yeah I'm never flying out of this garbage airport again.",-1
2019-05-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,needs professional training on how to talk to customers,True," Wiki-wiki shuttle complaint at Honolulu airport. The wiki-wiki shuttle bus driver at this airport was so angry and belligerent towards the passengers after picking us up from the international arrival gate to take us to the luggage area. He picked us up from the gate on May 5, 2019 at around 9:37 am. He was so angry that he yelled at everyone in the bus as he told us to ""Move back! This is a full flight, the sooner you move back, the sooner we can do this!"" and repeatedly yelled at us with the same statement, only more belligerent and agitated at each time he repeated. He looked as if he was ready to fight the passengers at the front of the shuttle. He was so angry to a point of harassment towards us. I do not understand why he treated the visitors and returning residents to Hawaii like this? There seems to be a fake Aloha being thrown around this airport. This wiki-wiki shuttle driver needs professional training on how to talk to customers. He would not have a job without passengers that arrive and leave from this airport. Arrogant. He was so aggressive and hostile towards the passengers, I am still perplexed what the heck did we do to him?",-1
2019-05-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,no directional signage,True," 
What a disaster. I could not find a single sign in the inter-island terminal to point me towards the mainland/international terminal. When I arrived at the mainland/international terminal I could find no sign telling me if I were in Terminal 1 or Terminal 2. I could not easily locate an arrivals/departure display. Upon my return to the islands I could not find a single sign in the mainland/international terminal to point me towards the inter-island terminal. Departure boards in the mainland/international terminal did not display inter-island flights. Many forking hallways had no directional signage. I nearly missed my connection in both directions.",-1
2019-04-29,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,Disorganised would be the operative word,False,"  What is there not to enjoy about an 80 minute wait to check in? As a frequent traveller, to lots of airports, this one is pretty bad on the face of it. Disorganised would be the operative word - 4 check in staff for about 200 travellers, 3 of whom were looking after 1 set of travellers for some time. Glacial movement on the queue and when you see people being pulled out of that queue because they are about to miss their flight, then you know the check in isn't going well. Also the first airport I have been asked to step out of one queue for security (with 30 or so others) and then walk about 500m to a completely different security spot downstairs as they were unable to cope with the numbers. Considering so much of Hawaii is about tourism, they certainly aren't wasting money on improving the arrival/departure processes.",-1
2019-01-16,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,"This airport is the pits""
",False,"  This airport is the pits! My flight doesn't take off for 3 more hours, but there are about 15 of us sitting in a diesel fumed corridor. It would be nice to be able to sit in the gate area where there are restrooms. The restrooms are few and mostly dirty.",-1
2018-11-26,0.4,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,slowly getting better,False,"  Honolulu Airport is slowly getting better. My wife and I have been through this airport many times starting in the early 70's. The check in area is dark with a cement atmosphere. The mens bathroom was absolutely disgusting, very poorly maintained. There are a number of ""YES"" high end shops. Very few eating places other than a few fast food kiosks in a small food court. There are improvement slowly being made. Security check in was much better this time. We arrived early to check in with Air Canada and that process has much improved. This open concept has its advantages however there are drawback. Overall this is not the worst airport I have been through but it certainly does not rank in my top ten list.",-1
2018-10-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,such a lack of organization,False," This was the worst airport for departures ever experienced. Lines went out the door to the sidewalk. We asked one employee inside where the luggage check for first class (HA airlines) was located and she sent us outside to stand in a line for check-in. We had already checked in. The crowds were large. Finally we went back in through another entry door and found the first class baggage check. Now all they do is tag your bags and send you to another line for loading bags. At lest that line was short. Then on to the TSA precheck, again we had to exit the building to stand outside. The ticketing lobby was so small, that they had to have security at PreCheck to let people pass from one side to the other side. Then when the Precheck line was shorter, they would allow you to enter the building to get in line. Rest of the experience was ok. There seems to be a lack of knowledge in at least the employees we talked with, exception HA employees, to be able to guide you anywhere. We heard multiple complaints about this while waiting to figure out where we were really suppose to go. We have never experienced such a lack of organization. The automated walk ways were not functional, bathrooms had inoperable toilets and sinks, enough worked that the wait lines for women were not too bad. Don't think we will ever fly out of Honolulu again.",-1
2018-08-09,0.2,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Honolulu Airport customer review,False,"  Crazy security lines. I live here, travel several times per month inter island. I have TSA Pre and Platinum status but even those lines are out the door onto the sidewalk, standing in the rain sometimes. This has been the case all summer. Big change from earlier in the year. No explanation from security or airline personnel who range in demeanour from indifferent to hostile.",-1

",False,"  We arrived at Honolulu airport from Aus and departed a few days later for NYC. OK so the airport is crowded but we found all staff to be incredibly helpful and efficient. At no time were we in any doubt as to what to do or where to go. At every turn we were directed by staff to the next stop. On arrival, we went through customs as quickly as we have experienced at any international airport. On leaving the airport our pre arranged shuttle was exactly where we were told it would be and we were on our way in no time. On departure to NYC we once again got through the airport quickly and easily. We had to be bused to our terminal because the airport is undergoing a large upgrade at the moment. If you do all the usual airport things like allow plenty of time, check in online beforehand, declare any food items, etc. you will find your experience at Honolulu airport as pleasant as ours was.",1
2018-04-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,Security was so rude,False,  Our departure was the worst experience of our time traveling. Security was so rude. We were yelled at and treated like we did something wrong. My grandkids have better manners then they did. I would not go back again. You need to give some of the workers a lesson on how to treat people.,-1
2018-04-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,A totally unpleasant experience,False,"  A totally unpleasant experience, hard to tell which is worse, departure or arrival. On departure, long and slow security lines, confusing with three feeding into two so that some people who arrived later got through earlier- unfair. Check-in at Interisland terminal, also used by Hawaiian Air for mainland and international flights, total chaos at midday. On international arrival, herded into ""wiki wiki"" shuttle bus for short trip to immigration. People with carry-ons and small children forced to stand, Immigration hall too small to handle many overnight flights from Asia which arrive close to each other, causing incredibly long lines. Unlike most airports were luggage goes around carousel making it easy to spot, airport workers remove luggage from carousel making it difficult to find. After finally navigating this travesty, faced with traffic jam of cars, taxis and shuttles trying to pick up passengers. That such a shambolic airport be named after a distinguished gentleman, Senator Daniel Innouye is a crime.",-1
2018-04-05,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Absolute chaos,True," Using Domestic Terminal to fly to New York from Oahu. Absolute chaos. The queues make no sense and merge into each other for boarding passes and bag drop off. There is a system and it could work well if there were instructions anywhere. You first need to weigh your check in bags and the screens are really self explanatory. You have good choices to use eticket scan, input flight confirmation no. Scan passport etc. The machine then walks you through weighing bags etc before printing off your boarding passes, bag tags and receipt for any costs. You then need to join the bag drop off queue once you work out where it ends as the queues for the bag weigh machines stem out around circular hubs and invariably merge with the single bag drop queue. Once you’ve dropped off your bag, you need to work out which security queue you need to be in. Security B is TSA and the others A, C and D are for all others. We were in C despite this being clearly labelled “international” when we were going to Mainland US. Once you get through security, options for food etc are ok. Toilets were dated but clean. There is free WiFi and sockets to charge phones etc free. Travel to the gates is far easier by foot than the further confusion of the wiki wiki bus. The airport is small enough to get to any of the gates within 10 mins Walking and they’re well signposted (although your bags are scanned again as you technically go outside albeit undercover). In summary, once you get through security it’s ok inside. Just try and do as much yourself as if you need to rely on staff, you’ll struggle.",-1

",True," This airport is totaly inadequate to modern airtravel. Long queues everywhere, no proper signs or information. Every step requires several stops. Security control is a joke. People yelling at you contradictory orders. There are no plastic boxes at the scanning machines for your personal items but after control there are hundreds of them lying in a corner. The entire terminal is overcrowded and hasn't changed at all since the 90s, while air travel changed dramatically. It's a shame that the main airport of these beautiful islands is such a mess.",-1

Sitting at Gate 14 waiting for my departure flight. I've traveled a lot around world including several 3rd countries. Honolulu Airport is just plain dirty. I am embarrassed for people around world to see this. The airport maybe a bit dated but that is no excuse for the filth. The walls, ceiling, sinks, toilets, tiles, light fixtures are soiled, there are fingerprints, grease, dirt everywhere. The workers and Management, and local government has no pride in their State, work or themselves I guess.",-1
2018-01-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,the worlds worst security staff,True," The Hawaiian airports have the worlds worst security staff. You can hear them yelling long before you get to security. They just keep yelling and being ignorant to people. Also if you put your shoes in the tray they give you heck. I have been asked if I treat my owen house that way, when I put shoes in the tray. Do they not realize that in all the other airports in the world we have to put our shoes im the tray? We don't read minds.",-1

",True," I’m sad to report that this has to be the worst airport in the United States. The bathrooms are filthy, small, outdated, etc. This was my first trip to Hawaii and I was really surprised at the airport. I’m used to Portland, Oregon, which is the #1 airport in America, so I do have pretty high standards, but I know I’m not out of line here at all. I truly hope someone with some authority reads this and other reviews as this is an honest review. Embarrassing to our country.",-1
2018-01-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Security is a nightmare,False,"  
Security is a nightmare, here everything goes slower than other places. I know they do "" Hawaiian time"" but when you have the waited over 2 hours to get past that is not acceptable. It's old and out of date so do yourself a favour and arrive in good time.",-1
2017-11-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,washroom disgustingly dirty,False," I have been to 3rd world countries that have better airport facilities than Honolulu. I asked a TSA agent where a bathroom was located on arrival in the baggage pickup area and was told that he was not an information booth. Great Aloha welcoming. I have been to the Islands many times as we go there every year for a 2-3 month stay. This is not the norm. The washroom was disgustingly dirty. No soap, no towels an absolute disgrace. More high end shopping places than eating establishments. Open concept is nice however it does have its drawbacks. The check in area is dark and dreary reminds me of a cement car park garage. There are improvements being made. eg parking facilities. They charge 2-3 dollars for a baggage cart. Another nickel and dime travel expense. Security screening area is far too small for the number of people being screened at one time.",-1
2017-11-17,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,indoor signage is poor,False,"  This airport was the worst part of our trip to Hawaii. It is older and dreary, surprising seeing that it is a tourist destination. As others have noted, indoor signage is poor. Amenities such as shopping, are limited. I had to look to find a shop to buy even a bottle of water, and then endured a long line as only on cashier was on duty. The Delta gate we were at was large with adequate seating, but while air-conditioned was still warm. And no working wifi. I don't know if it was just down when we were there or if it is truly non-existent. I dreaded every minute at this airport.",-1
2017-11-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,there were no signs whatsoever,False,"  The worst airport I’ve ever been to, out of over 20. Arriving there, there were no signs whatsoever indicating where the exit was, or where to find public transport. When coming back to depart, the departures location turned out to be the car rental, and there was only 1 sign indicating roughly what way to go towards departures. Arriving there, the airport officer told us there was no flight leaving to Seattle that night. Turned out there was, just from a different gate that was difficult to find as well. Once inside, there were barely any charging stations, and the 3 they have do not even have seating. Even the coffee shop only has 2, meaning only 2 people can charge their phone at a time. I’m sitting on the ground as we speak. There is no wifi either, so forget about getting any work out of the way while waiting for your delayed flight - of which they forgot to inform you. Worst airport experience of my life, would avoid this airport at any cost. Would have given it a 0/10 if it were possible.",-1
2017-09-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,the most disorganized chaos I have ever witnessed,False,"  Honolulu Airport almost ruined our honeymoon! We arrived two hours early for a weekday afternoon, inter-island flight to Maui. The scene at the ticketing and bag check was the most disorganized chaos I have ever witnessed. It was completely unclear which mess of a line to get into for bag checking, and the staff was rude and unhelpful. After asking 3 staff members for assistance and receiving only grunts in response, I finally found the correct bag check area. It was a complicated self check process that took even tech savvy people upwards of 20 minutes to properly navigate. Then we were ushered back outside into a pre-security line that didn't move for 30 minutes because they didn't have enough staff available! By this point our flight was about to board! Staff were sarcastic and unsympathetic, remarking that we'd ""better hurry and run."" I've been to third world countries that have easier and more effiecient airports than Honolulu.",-1
2017-08-27,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,transfer just a nightmare,False," Total Chaos. Arrived into Honolulu on a morning flight from SYD and had to transfer to SFO, both on Hawaiian Airlines. Was told in Sydney to go to area ""O"" to drop bags after going through immigration and customs, but when we went there was told no, this is not Hawaiian bag drop. We had to go outside the terminal to be confronted with no signage and lot of lines seemingly going nowhere. Immigration and customs had already taken an hour, we had only a 2 hour gap between flights. Eventually nearly in tears we found a lovely lady from HA who took our bags from us and told us to run to the security line which we did, then another sprint to the gate. Made it on to the flight but when we arrived that night in SFO our bags didn't make it - we were without luggage for a day and a half. In my experience with HNL airport (probably been there over 10 times) it's fine if you're coming in and staying but when you try to transfer to a different flight it's just a nightmare. Seriously, add some signage! English is my first language and I couldn't find my way around - imagine if you were coming from a non English speaking country - no chance!",-1
2017-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,,1.0,complete lack of organization,False," Departing out of Honolulu is similar to using a 3rd world country airport as far as their security is concerned. My flight was to depart at 715 AM, and I arrived at the airport at 515 AM. I used the luggage valet, which meant that they took care of the agriculture screen and checking the bags. (Well worth the tip as a side note, no time spent with checking the bags). I have TSA pre-check and flew first class for this flight. I waited in a security line labelled TSA pre-check, which was approx. 20 yards long. After 10 minute wait, a staff member came to us and told us to move to another area to wait, and assured me that there also was a TSA pre-check. Once I walked 40 yards to get to the new area, one had to enter through a door, and encountered another member of staff. She rudely said ""no separate for pre-check"". The line was long and winding, and since 20-30 showed up more after us, there was now going back to the original line. We did not want this somewhat inefficient experience to ruin our Hawaii vacation, so we patiently waited. After 20 minutes of wait, a group of 20-30 travellers showed up. Since there were so many of them, the security staff decided to open up a new line and let these folks essentially go to the front of the line! The staff said this was being done to move the lines along. What about those of us with Pre-check, who showed up 2 hours earlier, patiently waiting in line? What is maddening the most, is the complete lack of organization. No preferential treatment for people who were waiting in line, no preferential treatment for TSA pre-check, etc. The line is being managed by someone who could care less about customer service or fairness. Really leaves a bad taste upon leaving after a Hawaii vacation. Honolulu Airport authority needs to seriously look at how they run their services at peak times.",-1
2017-06-24,0.3,Business,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,they have no wifi,False,"  It's 2017 and they have no wifi. Upon my arrival, I inquired at an info desk and was told they are currently installing wifi. Upon my departure, I experienced rude and unprofessional ""welcomes"" at four restaurants, including: PGA Tour Grill, California Pizza Kitchen, Gordon Biersch, and The Local at HNL. I walked away from all of them, finding a very professional young man working at Burger King. I arrived at 6 pm and 80% of the stores were closed.",-1
2017-06-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,most unorganized airport,False," Honolulu has been one of the worst airport experiences of my life. I flew in on an international flight and was told I had to get my bag, recheck it, and then go through security again. There were signs to mainland USA, but when I got to the sign where it said to take the elevator, there was no floor number to go to. So I just had to pick a floor. When I finally found Hawaiian check-in there was just one huge queue. No one knew what they were doing, half of the check in computers were not working, and then I couldn't even get a seat number when I dropped my bag off. Then security took 45 minutes, and the line was not that long. Finally got through security and had to walk a mile to find my gate. These sound like little things, but this was the most unorganized airport I've ever been to. I will try at all costs to never fly through here or use Hawaiian Airlines again.",-1
2017-05-20,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,had no problems at all,False,"  We had read some bad reviews about the airport at Honolulu but had no problems at all. We applied for a ESTA Visa which gave us reassurance about entering USA. The customs officer on arrival was very welcoming and when we departed we were met by a gentleman at the Air NZ area and what a huge difference he made, just couldn't believe how the stresses of travelling could be completely alleviated by such a helpful and cheerful fellow who made us feel like royalty. Once again, clearing customs was smooth, first time we've had to take off shoes etc but that's America. The arrivals area was in need of brightening but the departures area had good facilities and seemed pleasant.",1
