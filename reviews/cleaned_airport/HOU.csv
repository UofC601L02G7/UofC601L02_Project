2023-10-06,0.1,Family Leisure,3,3,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,has quite a problem with luggage cart rental,True," I am disappointed to say that I think Hobby, perhaps the whole Houston Airport system, has quite a problem with luggage cart rental. I was traveling on Monday 10/02/2023 evening with my daughter and grandson, from Denver to Houston. While on vacation my daughter injured herself and was wheelchair bound. When we arrived at Houston Hobby baggage claim where I needed to rent a cart to retrieve luggage and get her to the handicapped pick-up place while getting my 4 year old grandson to move along with us easily. I swiped my credit card and was unable to get the cart loose so I swiped again and got the cart. and was charged twice. I am now trying to get a refund on the second $7.00 charge and am unable to get through on the e-mail address they provide. Then I tried making a complaint. As I did so I marked complaint on the format they provided to contact them. It kept deleting my phone number so their system would not accept the complaint. I decided to check compliment where it promptly took my request for a refund. What has happened to the Houston Airport system? It should not be difficult to contact the right person for a mistake.",-1
2023-08-14,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,favorite places to eat are no longer here,True,"  Travel to West Texas from South Texas to visit grandkids 2-3+ times a year. Seems like I always have 2-3 + hours to wait either way I am going. So, I am always looking for a relaxing place to sit. I have noticed on this trip that some of my favorite places to eat are no longer here. What a pity. The sit down food available at the present time is extremely poor, over priced & there is always a wait to be seated even seating for one. If you choose the fast food options, there are long lines & then no place to sit to eat. Why must the city of Houston rip travelers off by charging outrageous prices for food that is barely a step above fast food. Also, more of variety of food offered would be nice.",-1
2023-05-16,0.1,Business,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,miss the Pappas restaurants in Hobby,True,  I miss the Pappas restaurants in Hobby. Good food selection and reasonable airport price. The replacement food service is double the price. I will not be a customer.,-1
2023-05-13,0.4,Business,4,3,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,most of the restaurants were closed,True,"  Don't often fly into Hobby, but in rare cases it's a better option. Not to thrilled with the airlines, you're pretty much stuck with Southwest. Was looking forward to eating at Pappasitos but guess the city kicked them out. And the day of my departure most of the restaurants were closed. Not fun because I arrived 3 hours early. Even though I can expense my dinner I decided to just wait till I get to my destination. I'll fly into Houston twice more in the next two months and will continue to use IAH as there are many more options.",-1
2021-11-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Where are the healthy food options,True,  Where are the healthy food options in this airport? Ridiculous that the only options are donuts and fast food! This is 2021! People want healthier options.,-1
2021-09-07,0.5,Family Leisure,2,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,,Wifi here is awful,True,"  Wifi here is awful, at least near Gate 42. Multiple tries and fails, occasionally get the splash screen to connect. After all of that, frequently disconnected. Start again.",-1
2021-03-30,0.4,Business,5,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,3.0,enforcement of the mask mandate at this airport is a joke,False,"  The enforcement of the mask mandate at this airport is a joke. While waiting at gate 41 there were six passengers not wearing masks and several people walking the concourse without out masks, including one SW airline employee.",1
2019-10-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,2,5,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,does have some of the worst signage I've ever seen,True," The airport is clean, nicely compact and easy to navigate, once on the property. It has clearly been renovated in the relatively recent past, and that is seen in how spacious the security area now is, and how modern the architecture now is. Check-in was quite easy and hassle-free. Security is quite time-consuming, tedious trudge if you don't have TSA Pre-Check, but if you do have Pre-Check, you're pretty much golden! There are several pretty nice stores and restaurants post-security, nothing fancy, nothing even particularly Texan, but satisfactory. However, I can't bring myself to particularly like this airport. Unless the much nastier-in-almost-every-way Bush airport across town, which has friendly personnel, the people that work at Hobby seem to have taken on a mission to be snarky and ""power-trippy"" toward passengers. From shuttle bus drivers to ticketing agents, from TSA personnel to store clerks, and from restaurant employees to gate agents, hardly anybody at Hobby seems to appreciate the fact that they actually work at a fairly beautiful, modern airport. If Bush employees can have a positive attitude, so, too, should Hobby employees, but maybe that's asking for too much! Furthermore, this airport does have some of the worst signage I've ever seen, at least approaching the airport and within the terminal pre-security; the quality of the signage is great, but the directions can be confusing. Also, the economy parking lot fills up easily and often, forcing unfortunate drivers to park in the parking garage adjacent to the terminal, which costs something like $24 USD daily. All in all, this airport has a lot of the aesthetic measures on point, but the management there seem to fail to remember that airports always serve as introductions to cities and regions. Are snarky and ""power-trippy"" personnel who they really want to represent Houston and Texas? I really want to like this airport, but I just can't! What a shame.",-1
2018-11-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,security line always confusing,False," The security check line is always confusing, you will be taken through a weird zigzag line, then end up in one line. Then an angry employee will yell at everyone “there are two lines”! So people move over, other customers get upset because there was no indication that there are two lines and they get cut in front of. Then, once you are in line to get searched, the employees yell something sarcastic or mean about changing lines, “don’t look at me funny, I only work here.” Then you will end up changing lines again for the actual security check. All the while, the employees treat you with anger, like it’s the customers fault that it is so unorganized. If the lines were more odvious, like all of the other airports in the US, the customers and employees would be much happier.",-1
