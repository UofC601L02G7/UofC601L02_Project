2024-06-09,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Don’t fly out of BHM,False,"   Staff should be retrained on customer service! Especially American. They are very rude and disrespectful. Flight crew got off the plane and went to another gate 20 min after we were “suppose” to board. When we asked what’s going on we received nothing but attitude from the gate agent. Another gate agent walked up and totally ignored our concerns. We’re at B1 for flight 5253 to CLT. Shortly after the gate agent says there is a maintenance issue and they won’t be in for another 2 hours. We all had the same question: Why wasn’t the plane inspected the night before, being it’s an early morning flight. Secondly, why isn’t maintenance on-site during hours of operation? This is very unprofessional! If there were other options outside of this place that were closer I’d explore it because no one deserves to be treated this way especially early in the morning. I’d rather drive 3 hours to Atlanta than to deal with these Attitudes after we pay our money for a service! My recommendation Don’t fly out of BHM especially with American !",-1
2024-05-21,0.4,Couple Leisure,3,1,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,Food options are very limited,True, Spent the last two days and one night inside the airport. My husband went to several different bathrooms and he said they all smell like urine. Terrible like the guy mopping is just smearing all around. The women’s bathroom had dirty floors and pieces of trash lying around. Several of the toilets weren’t flushed. Food options are very limited. Bham is a foodie city and we should show that off to the world. Maybe allow local favorites to set up pop ups during the tourist seasons!! I could give you tons of recommendations as to who to invite and share their menus with travelers. Give them a true taste of Birmingham.,-1
2022-03-06,0.5,Couple Leisure,1,1,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,Security lines are insane,False,"  Security lines are insane. This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle. Bottom line: pay your toll at the troll bridge or suffer along with the peasants.",-1
