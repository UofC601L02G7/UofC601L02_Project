2020-02-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,TSA is horrendously unprofessional,False,"  As a frequent traveler, this is the worst airport I’ve ever been in. Flights are perpetually delayed with no information given to passengers. Luggage has been left on the tarmac twice and not put on the plane. TSA is horrendously unprofessional. Searched through my entire luggage and strip searched me with no information given as to why I was being subjected to this. After requesting a private room for the degrading pat down, they made me remove my pants to examen my knee brace and then the TSA agent opened the door to the screening room before I was dressed. If I didn’t have to frequently come to Tallahassee for family I would boycott this airport. This is the worst excuse of an airport I’ve ever seen.",-1
