2024-08-19,0.1,Business,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"“confusion, delays and closed sections”",True," Every time I arrive from international flights there is confusion, delays and closed sections to go from customs to connecting flights. On this occasion you had to exit the airport security after i rechecked bag then re entere to the terminal, I had duty free bottles of wine so i asked the bag check attendant and told since it's duty free it should be fine... not a chance had to check my back pack and hope it makes it without breaking. Also When Sky train has non functioning station there is a sign for it after you've gone all the way up to the station. I always try to avoid this airport for international entry.",-1
2024-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,an intense nightmare,True,"   Started with rude traffic officers when my husband was helping bring my 7 year old son across the street. The baggage check is confusing, signs don’t matter and there’s virtually walls of people and no one helping direct you. I was redirected to a different entrance 3 times, even though I was following the signs properly. TSA was rude. No bins for small items or your bags. After getting to the gate it was fine but going through back check and TSA was an intense nightmare. It’s fine for solo travel I guess but traveling through this airport with children was awful",-1
2024-07-04,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,,5.0,1.0,TSA staff rude,False,"   TSA staff rude. Moved about without purpose or care - slowly with apathy. One rep on their phone. 2 security lines open. One line jammed up due to having to take a bag off line to check. Waited 15 minutes in the line. Said they were short staffed and didn’t have anyone to check the bag. When we moved over to the next line because the one we were in directed us to, the other rep yelled at us and said she had customers waiting before us. Are we not also her customers that were waiting? She then glared at us and was whispering to another rep about us. Condescending and rude to travelers. They were laughing at people trying to get through, including airline crew and airport staff for being frustrated. This causes anger and frustration and a poor overall mood for passengers when good and positive attitudes would support happy and positive travelers and less issues on airplanes. Embarrassed for this country with international travelers when other countries are kind and calm to travelers because they know it is important for commerce, mental health, and relations with other people. When we finally made it through there were 15 TSA staff standing just inside the concourse having a meeting. Gate staff were kind as well as the staff at the Juan Valdez coffee shop, otherwise would have given a zero.",-1
2024-06-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,4.0,,4.0,1.0,crowded and confusing,False,   Worst customs ever. Consistently crowded and confusing. Staff are condescending and rude. Facilities are dirty. The connecting flights lines were very disorganized and people were panicking had a 2 hour layover barely made it to my connection. Trash bins were overflowing in terminal D. No water stations. Very outdated.,-1
2024-06-08,0.2,Business,1,2,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,keep a lot of time to complete security,False,"  Really sad airport, not clean, equipment breakdowns but keep a lot of time to complete security checks. They do not open multiple security check areas which basically means that up to 10 flights use the small security check areas. It took me 1.5 hours to clear this.",-1
2024-06-03,0.3,Family Leisure,3,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,third world services and facilities,True,  Shameful. A city with the international importance and financial opulence as Miami cannot have third world services and facilities like MIA. I used to like this airport but in the last year there has been a significant decline.,-1
2024-05-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,True,"  This place must be a joke. No, seriously, how is it even possible an airport like this one in a city like Miami? Worst experience ever. If you are flying to/from Miami please be careful.",-1
2024-05-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no decent restaurants,False,"   What is wrong with the people running this airport? Dirty, no decent restaurants at least on concourse G. Minimal electrical outlets. Bus had to take us to two separate sides to unload the bus. When was this airport built?",-1
2024-04-09,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,What a joke of an airport,True,  Dirty airport. Surly retail people. There was a fight that broke out and I told 2 workers to get police and they couldn’t understand English. What a joke of an airport.,-1
2024-04-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,Such a messy place,True,  Such a messy place. It’s a very crowded place with not enough staff. Due to air traffic my flight got delayed from the departure city. At the arrival due to the same issue it took us awhile to get off the plane. Once out we had to walk miles to get to the passport control area where we found hundreds of people waiting in line. Many of us having a connection flight and there were only a few agents working so because of this a lot of us were late for the connection flight. After this the check point took even longer to get through and once again not enough staff was there working. Also I had to pick up my luggage and drop it for the connection flight something I never had to do with any other airline. We traveled with American Airlines (not recommended) after getting through all of this we had to walk miles again to get to our gate which was at the very end of the hallway only to let us know that we had lost our flight and there was nothing to do other than placing us at a standby list and hope for the best only because it wasn’t the airline fault. According to the American airlines agent this had to do with the controllers and the air traffic so they wouldn’t offer us a hotel room or food just because this was the airport fault. We ended up spending a whole night there where we couldn’t even get a bag of chips because they got rid of vending machines so they have no food options passed 11 pm. Honestly a pretty bad experience. I’ve been to plenty of airports and they’re never this disorganized. Miami you need to step up!,-1
2024-03-30,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,lowest on my list of airports,False,"  I flew in and out of Miami airport twice in Mar 2024. What a zoo! Uber did not find us, Hotel taxi drove past us twice. Getting to the car rental area was long and then waited forever for a car to be taken off campus. This airport is lowest on my list of airports.",-1
2024-03-26,0.2,Business,1,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,“the staff are miserable”,False," I amazes me as European how Americans think everything they have is the best in the world, when it comes to first impressions of a country its main airports fly the flag as to what to expect once you are there. Sadly Miami airport has to be one of the worst organized airports in the world, everything takes forever, the staff are miserable, no one could care less, the facilities / shopping / dining consists of basic third world stuff, the place is grubby, half the elevators don’t work. Place is a dump. Thought that DeSantis bloke was supposed to be good, judging by Miami airport he’s a dunce. Airport looks and feels like everyone has given up. Won’t be flying back through here again, don’t care if it costs more to go through somewhere else, this place just ruins the start or finish of any joinery.",-1
2024-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,baggage claim was a hell of disorder,True,"  Coming into Miami from abroad to connect to a flight in the US none of the walkways worked from Terminal D to passport control nor the Skywalk. the baggage claim was a hell of disorder. Then to go through to-our connection we had to go through security again//really! And the line was unbelievably long, the TSA staff did not give clear instructions about what to put in the bins, bags that had already successfully gone through inspection were shunted off for detailed inspection, which lasted 15minutes. Then we had to walk all the way back through Terminal D to its far end to get to our gate. This is a failure of the Airport Administration.",-1
2024-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Worst airport experience,True,"  Worst airport experience in decades. Broken skytrain, walkways, escalators and elevators. Unhelpful and rude staff. Forced to walk miles and wait in lines for hours. Almost missed a connecting flight in the same terminal (D) with 3 hours time. We did not have time to use the restroom, sit down, eat or drink a thing. 3 hours were spent running, hauling bags and waiting in long lines. Staff is rude and goes out of their way to not help you. My 3 year old got hurt and was bleeding from the mouth due to the hazards in this airport and staff not only refused helping her but laughed and talked about how she had fallen in Spanish (which I understand and speak!) . Golf carts meant to replace the sky train do not help even those with children or disabilities (they seem to only help other staff members and chat in their cell). They also broke my bag, however I didn’t have time to file a claim due to the terrible experience. Avoid this airport at all costs!",-1
2024-03-01,0.1,Business,1,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,"Overall terrible experience"" ",False,   Our flight was at 7am and Enterprise only opens at 5am. When we finally got everything sorted out it was 5:20 and the elevator as well as the escalators didn’t work so my husband had to carry 4 luggage items up 4 flights of stairs. Then the moving escalator to the train also didn’t work. When we got to the terminal the escalator to the ticket counter didn’t work. The security line wait time was 25mins. Overall terrible experience.,-1
2024-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"horrible, dingy, old, awful airport",True,"  If you're a fan of inefficiency and a dash of the cold shoulder,  venturing into MIA is like stepping into a time machine, and not the cool, futuristic kind. It's more akin to a leap backwards into an era where charm and functionality are myths, and cramped, outdated spaces are the harsh reality.  The staff ability to maintain an aura of indifference in the face of any question or plea for help is truly commendable. It's as if they've taken the concept of 'the cold shoulder' and elevated it to an art form. Navigating the airport is akin to participating in an escape room you never signed up for. The layout is so cramped and convoluted. It’s clear the design was inspired by a labyrinth, with a dash of ""let's see how many people we can confuse before noon."" Calling it 'old and dated' is a kindness. It's as if the airport is stuck in a bygone era, stubbornly refusing to join us in the 21st century. The charm of yesteryear has certainly overstayed its welcome here. But the pièce de résistance has to be the TSA security clearance - a spectacle so inefficient and embarrassing, it deserves its own reality TV show. The TSA staff, not wanting to be outdone by their airport colleagues, take rudeness to new heights, skirting the line of abusiveness with a finesse that would make a drill sergeant blush. It's a process so fraught with frustration, you'd think it was designed as a test of human endurance. In an era where digital connectivity is akin to oxygen, MIA somehow manages to turn free WiFi into a luxury item. Thanks to the generosity of American Express, passengers can access the internet, provided they have the patience to sit through ads. It's a charming reminder of the dial-up era, a nostalgic throwback that no one asked for. The concept of passenger experience seems to be an alien one at MIA. From the lack of food outlets to the scarcity of lounges, it's as if they're pioneering a new minimalist approach to airport amenities - less is more, and in the case of MIA, much less. In conclusion, if you're seeking an airport experience that combines the charm of a Soviet-era bus station with the efficiency of a sloth, look no further than Miami International Airport. It's an adventure you won't forget, no matter how hard you try. I wholeheartedly advise anyone to avoid this horrible, dingy, old, awful airport at all costs. It's truly a masterclass in how not to run an airport.",-1
2024-02-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,a disorganized mess,False,  Over 2 hours in immigration line. Miami Airport is a disorganized mess and no one seems to care. Non citizens line must have been 3 or 4 hours judging by the lines. Disgraceful.,-1
2024-01-21,0.4,Couple Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,3.0,2.0,"Avoid this airport"" ",True,  Avoid this airport whenever possible. We have travelled over 10 times and going through Miami on an international flight is by far going to be your worst experience. Do not go through with a short connection. They are unorganized and mismanaged. For such a busy airport you would think they had a great system. Send your management to Japan or any other US airport to see how to do it. Hire someone that wants to improve.,-1
2024-01-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,3.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,My experience was terrible,False,"  My experience at this airport was terrible. I was connecting through Miami in a flight to Barcelona (Spain). The connection was quite short (90 mins) due to an earlier delay in the first flight. The lines for passport control were massive, I have never seen anything like it, so I asked the staff if there was a priority line for connections and emphasised my short connection. After a bit of confusion and me having done most of the regular line, eventually someone came and handed us the orange cards and we went into a separate queue. The short connection queue was still quite long, so I requested one of the staff if he could organise it prioritising those with flights leaving earliest, like my own. I was understandably quite nervous about missing my flight, as I was travelling with my mother, a senior with a disability. The gentleman said he couldn’t do anything and that I had to wait, I insisted that the system was making little sense but was in no way disrespectful. Another passenger was allowed to go to the front of the queue however, which I thought was unfair particularly to me as I was the one with the earliest flight. I also can’t understand as a key international hub there isn’t any organisation whatsoever to connecting flights",-1
2024-01-06,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,absolutely disappointing,False," Miami Airport is a disgrace to Florida. Filthy areas with rubbish left everywhere and disorganized staff! The immigration and security staff were extremely rude to everyone lining up. I would not recommend this airport ever again as this airport needs to seriously improve. Seeing an airport looking filthy, no carpets, and disgraceful staff is absolutely disappointing and it seriously needs to improve if it wants to step into competing with different airports! Disgraceful place and avoid at all costs!",-1
2024-01-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,1.0,“staff are very rude”,True," This is the worst airport I’ve ever been. The security check is extremely slow and the staff are very rude. It took us about an hour to go through the security checkpoint and we missed our flight. We have to stay an extra day at Miami and we missed our family gathering for New Year’s Eve. The airport design is so poor, if you went to the gate A-D and you want to go to gate E or F, you have to come out completely and redo the security check. So if your gate is at E or F, you can’t enjoy the priority lounge which locates at gate D. The security staff asked us to check in our prepaid carryon luggage as she thinks it is bigger than the standard size although we measure the size at home and it fits the measurements of the allowed carryon according to the airline instructions. So combined with the worst airline the Frontier our vacation is ruined although Miami is a beautiful city, we don’t want to come back.",-1
2023-12-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,will never fly through here again,False,"  This airport shows no compassion or consideration for those citizens from around the world who arrive at its doors. A two hour wait in stifling heat, shuffling forwards to an area where just 6 booths were in operation to take account of the thousands of people arriving no water or seating provided. After dealing with COVID and all of its implications Miami has learnt nothing and appeared to move at a pace that was unable or unwilling to respond to the numbers amassing. I can honestly say that I will never fly through here again and I can only pass this information on to those yet to experience it.",-1
2023-12-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Does not acknowledge disabilities"" ",True,  Horrific. Does not acknowledge disabilities unless you have a wheelchair. My daughter has severe autism and we were told it doesn’t matter unless she was in a wheelchair. Next time we know to rent a wheelchair to get the help needed for a child with a disability. I don't know how they can completely ignore the Americans with disabilities act and still receive federal funding,-1
2023-12-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,I will avoid it at all costs,False,"  Our arriving plane had to sit on the tarmac for 25 to 30 minutes because there was no gate available. This made us late to our connecting flight, since the gate for that was about a mile away and this skytrain was broken, which I understand is as usual. I can’t walk that far and was so exhausted after clearing passport control, US customs, TSA, and then getting to the faraway gate. My American Airlines rep was not overly helpful or friendly either. The whole experience makes me never want to go there again. I will avoid it at all costs.",-1
2023-12-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,4.0,,90 minutes to get through immigration,True,"  The arrival process is shambolic. It took us 90 minutes to get through immigration. The queuing is poorly organized to the extent that you have to queue to enter the main queue, but as nothing is organized, there are loads of people milling all over the place. The immigration officer, once we got to the front of the queue was pleasant and friendly enough, but looked as though she had seen enough for the day too. Oh and of course only about half the booths were manned. Remember that immigration is the first thing that visitors see when they arrive in the USA. It's almost as though the country was trying to discourage tourists from coming.",-1
2023-11-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,a horrible airport,True,  This is a horrible airport. The signage is difficult to find. The bathroom was dirty. You had to walk miles because the skytrain was broken. Based on earlier reviews this has been the case for a long time. Asked people for directions to rental cars and nobody was able to help. Information desk or better signs would be useful. Avoid this airport if you can and Uber/Lyft rather than renting a car which was a separate disaster.,-1
2023-10-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,disappointed with Miami airport,False," I was disappointed with Miami airport on my departure on Oct 11, 2023, and then became even more disappointed upon my arrival on Oct. 18. The airports ""SkyTrain"" was not operational, and they had limited number of carts to help those in need. I am 73 years old but having to walk from baggage check-in (around gate 20) to gate 45 was not a pleasant experience. According to a friend, the Skytrain has been broken for about 6 months. I only witnessed two golf carts for seniors while walking about a half mile to my gate. Deplorable. To make matters worse, there was one section where the AC was broken. You think they would contract with a vendor to provide golf cart service above their normal service if the SkyTrain was out of order. My arrival was almost worse with a 1/2 to 3/4 mile walk with NO CARTS and NOT ONE OPERATIONAL PEOPLE MOVER (flat escalator). Try to avoid this airport at all costs, especially if you are elderly. They did have AED's. Now I know why.",-1
2023-10-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the most mismanaged airport,False,"  This is the most mismanaged airport that I have encountered in over 500,000 miles of travel.  Poor signage (DFW successfully redid all of their signs a few years ago). We were directed in the wrong direction several times. Asking employees for directions was no help because they did not know where baggage claim 6 was either.  Poor maintenance - Most elevators were out of service, and had apparently been so for months or years, since the signs directing you to the next working elevators were ragged and worn.  Restrooms not serviced - no paper towels or air dryers. Transportation services not available - the train was not operable; the golf carts were sitting unused with no driver. This was in Terminal D which is almost a mile long. When we arrived on an international flight we had an extremely long walk to customs and there were no chairs in which to rest.  There were unreasonably long distances to walk to immigration and customs - sometimes the signs sent domestic and international passengers in different directions, only for them to join again. The signs indicating which line to get in were confusing - we saw dozens of people being moved from one line to another.  It was very difficult to find hotel shuttles, and they are located in a dark area across several roads from the terminal. The electrical outlets in our seats had no power.  The entire design of the airport appeared to be by an architect who specializes in corn mazes.",-1
2023-10-13,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,Where are the friendly volunteers,False,"  I was traveling through MIA last weekend and found so many problems. There is no-one at the information desks. and when i ask some employees for some help, they ignored me or gave me bad information. Where are the friendly volunteers like other airports? Why are so many elevators not working and/or dirty? Perhaps MIA should retrain their employees.",-1
2023-10-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,disappointed and embarrassed of our airport,True," I was born and raised in Miami Dade County and so disappointed and embarrassed of our airport. Restrooms need maintenance, the acoustics throughout are poor and transportation is either non existent or impaired. My flight had a gate change at the last minute. The gates were about a football field apart. I hitched a ride on one of many wheel chairs, but got off soon as woman was suggesting she expected a tip. The security was unorganized, crowded. Management needs a good management system. It's done at other airports in Florida, successfully. The whole airport looks like it has patchwork construction and design, archaic layout. Wheelchairs and transport buses running where people walk! Gate signs don't make sense. I had to ask people where to find everything. Loud speaker sometimes can't be heard, sometimes loud. Terrible!! Where is our tax payer money going. It's certainly not going to this place. Governor DeSantis needs to overhaul the management. Tampa has a beautiful airport, comfortable, organized and beautiful restrooms. Jacksonville too...What the heck is going on in Miami??",-1
2023-09-03,0.5,Solo Leisure,2,3,2.0,5.0,0.0,,4.0,2.0,have more regard for the elderly,True,"  This is a plea for Miami and all other international airports to have more regard for the elderly at the airports. =I am 82 and walk much slower than before and standing in the one spot is a struggle. I arrived somewhere in Miami Terminal E after a horrid BA flight, walked for 20 minutes to the Immigration Area where I waited an hour before my turn came and then I walked some 30 minutes to a lounge at D 30 and then had to take a small train to the gate. I do not mind the walking if there are the electric walking lanes that are working but the standing in lines is a strain. - I have occasionally used a wheelchair but these are often promised but do not arrive. My other problem was going through security at Miami where I was told to keep my shoes on although I have artificial knees but then the person at the screening told me to take them off which is more difficult than the young may imagine.",-1

When arriving in Miami the customs line was a mile long - no exaggeration - I have video and photo. There were maybe a handful of officers to handle customs and thousands of passengers. We missed our connection. From standing in line for 2 hours. Then after getting baggage another line to leave so add another hour because 1 man was letting people out. Then a line of 550 feet to get vouchers from American Airlines. We did not wait because was already 10:30pm. No employees here to assist thousands of people. Same experience this morning. Stood in two huge lines to check in and get through security due to few employees working. Now we arrive at our gate, and not even half enough seats to sit in to wait. Meanwhile, remodeling is furiously happening. Perhaps Miami airport should hire people to work rather than remodel right now. Complete inept and terrible customer service.",-1

The most uncomfortable airport with lack of services that are found in most other airports in the U.S. Had an overnight stay, a loud buzzer sounded every 3 seconds from midnight to now 5.40 am, escalators going down operated but those going up were not functioning. The sky train was not operating for hours preventing me from being able to go to purchase water. This is not the only occasion that this has happened, it's just a poorly run airport!",-1

The once-blue carpets are black in most places and appear to have never been washed. Littered with food and trash everywhere - and the bathrooms are as back as a filthy run down gas station. I’m looking around as I write this and literary every service is filthy - the floor, the seats, the columns holding up the ceiling. Not just dusty, not just some loose rubbish - truly filthy. Avoid at all costs.",-1

I exited customs only to discover that the sign saying, Checked Baggage, abruptly ended as I found myself unsure where to bring my bag in the middle of the airport. I asked the single officer on duty. He had no idea. There was no there to assist passengers, only a pair of women behind a booth selling phone cards. The lack of signage or any personnel to guide passengers is shocking, and makes me think that Miami Airport has worse service (and security protocols) than airports in less developed nations. But I don’t think anyone in Miami or Florida gives a damn. Your standards are beneath those of many third world nations.",-1

Who ever is the manager should be sacked straight away. 2.5h waiting in the longest line ever, 3 officers behind the desk not rushing at all. At some point was only two of them and amount of people waiting more and more. Another airport in US which is 100 years behind of any airport in Europe - shame on you!",-1
2023-04-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,worst airport I’ve ever experienced,False,"  I’m embarrassed for the U.S. that this airport is a “gateway” for so many people. My flight from Dallas Love Field arrived in the G Concourse which reminds me of the old New York LaGuardia terminal. Low ceilings, narrow walkways, dirty, dark, interior. I made my way to ground transportation which was a nightmare. The signage is confusing and with the proliferation of ride share apps like Uber, Lyft, etc., one would think there would be ample signage. The entire ground transportation area is confusing, with inadequate signage. Then, there are the airport staff. I had trouble getting a Lyft, and decided to take a cab. The cab driver told me that since I was going to Hilton Airport Blue Lagoon, I had to take a “blue” taxi. I asked an airport ground transportation worker for directions and he pointed and said, “at the end.” I never found the blue taxi and finally ended up waiting for my hotel’s courtesy van for another 30 minutes.  Upon arrival back to the airport for my departing flight, the same chaos ensued. I arrived at the airport at 8:00 a.m. for my 11:55 a.m. flight back to Dallas. Since I had time to spare, I went to the Star Alliance Lounge between H and J. Security checkpoint was horrible. Crowded, confusing, and I was in the line for the TSA Pre-Check which they were merging with the CLEAR and general security screening. Employees are brash, if not just downright rude. The walkway between H and J was much nicer; except for the restrooms. Wow - I think they imported these from old gas stations. Dark, dirty, in disrepair. I finally made my way to the Star Alliance Lounge. The entrance to the elevator from the concourse level is two double doors that made me think I was going into the back kitchen of an old diner. Followed, by a dirty elevator with taped signage directing me to the lounge. The walk from the elevator to the lounge entrance made me think I was in the wrong place, but I kept walking and eventually found it. Finally a nice escape from the worst airport I’ve ever experienced.",-1
2023-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,This airport is filthy,False,"  This airport is filthy. There is dust under the chairs, food, and trash all over the floor. There are very limited food choices and they automatically charge 18% gratuity. The guy was so rude and did not deserve a tip. If I ever have a choice in the future, I will not pass through this airport. Also, there is not enough seating at the gates. The charging station has 4 slots and you have to stand near it to charge your phone. So pathetic.",-1
2023-04-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Dirty airport,False, Dirty airport. I can see the dirt on the overhead pipes where I am waiting for the departure. I am tired to see the airport not cleaning and not keeping up. We don't have any other choice to use other airport to travel and this airport needs new management.,-1
2023-04-04,0.4,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,customer support is nonexistent,False,"  I only came across people who spoke Spanish, and they were constantly chit-chatting. It seems as though we are interrupting their conversation when we pose a question or offer advice. For the same reason, the customer support is nonexistent. The coffee served at the terminal is bitter, of poor quality, and overly priced for subpar coffee. At 7 a.m., the airport's tables were already dirty, and people were chit-chatting in their coffee shops rather than cleaning them. I assume that even though people work and are paid to help others, the interruption of their conversation to answer questions or offer advice causes them inconvenience. Our TSA cards and Global Entry cards don't seem to signify anything.",-1
2023-03-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,4,2,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,What a horrible experience,False," What a horrible experience! I have never seen an airport with no sit down restaurants, rude employees, and very limited accommodations to sit and wait for hours. Never again, I will fly into Fort Lauderdale next time I leave Miami on a cruise, this place is a dump - not a fan of much in Miami!",-1

A woman in TSA line making smarmy comments about people’s luggage icing on the cake. Avoid this dump.",-1
2023-03-19,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,1,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,recommend avoiding international transfers,False,"  The logistics and operations of their international arrivals (customs and the baggage check and re-check) is a complete shambles and needs to be completely reconstructed, organized and properly staffed. When 2.5 hours is insufficient to ensure making your connecting flight something is wrong. We witnessed dozens of missed connections on 3/18 due mainly to the baggage carousel in the international arrivals terminal. A complete zoo. Several Inoperable escalators and moving walkways further complicated passenger movements. We recommend avoiding international transfers through Miami whenever possible.",-1
2023-03-10,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This place needs a total revamp,True,"  This airport is a joke. Rude staff, zero directions, and disgusting upkeep. They promote reducing plastic bottles yet only provide unsanitary drinking fountains to refill your water bottle. Good luck finding facilities that are even remotely clean let alone any food that isn’t cooked beyond consumption or the price you could get a decent meal elsewhere for. Security is a complete nightmare due to lack of communication, ticketing is so archaic you may as well have a punch style ticket. Save yourself the hassle and fly out of Ft. Lauderdale or Tampa. This place needs a total revamp from the ground up.",-1
2023-02-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,absolutely atrocious,False," My recent experience connecting through MIA was absolutely atrocious. My wife and I flew into Miami from the Caribbean, where we were connecting to a flight back to our home in San Diego. Getting through Customs with our Global Entry status was a breeze. But then MIA put all connecting international passengers into one gigantic line to get through security. There was no TSA PreCheck. The line was agonizingly slow. When we finally cleared security, we had to sprint more than 30 gates to get to our connecting flight. We made it with just a few minutes to spare. When I later emailed a complaint into TSA, I received an automated response. I have never been to any other U.S. airport that didn't offer PreCheck. That a major airport like MIA doesn't offer the service is inexcusable. If you're connecting internationally, avoid this airport if you can.",-1

First, none of the escalators were working so we all had to drag heavy baggage up a couple flights of stairs to get into immigration. Second, the sky tram was down, a long walk to immigration check in with heavy bags, no offered assistance. Then we are put in one line which isn't moving, so they shuffle us to the other end, more chaos, more time. I had to go through security 3x. First I waited in line to be told I had to check my roller bag. 2nd time in line my backpack goes thru the scanner, keeping in mind this is the 8th flight in 2 weeks with no previous issues, and TSA decides my $70 hiking sticks are an issue. Back to AA counter to check the sticks, no guarantees they'll make it, no guarantee they will replace them if lost. I was escorted by a TSA agent to the counter regarding my stick issue, still had to rerun everything a 3rd time their security. Next time I go to Ecuador I'll be connecting in Atlanta.",-1
2023-02-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,"Our experience was dreadful"" ",False,"  Our experience at Miami airport was dreadful from start to finish and I would recommend people to avoid using it if at all possible. All queues were ridiculous and so long that many people were extremely stressed and worried about missing connecting flights, as were we. Staff were often rude and unhelpful and the airport is confusing and very difficult to negotiate. I will try hard never to return. (I would have had a glass of wine to cheer myself up but it was far too expensive.)",-1
2023-01-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2 hours in line for passport review,True,  Waiting almost 2 hours in line for passport review and almost missed our connection. There were only a few kiosks open and the line was over 8 rows deep and went outside of the room. Completely unacceptable. Will try to avoid this airport for a connection next time.,-1
2023-01-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,how horrendous the experience is,False,"  Surprised to say that this airport did not exceed expectations at all. Since stepping off the aircraft to bags being in baggage claim was roughly 45min-1 hour. Now I flew American Airlines, which actually never took my bag off the flight so my bags ended up being sent to Vegas. I know that the problem is more with American Airlines and not the airport, but when trying to get help on where to go and who to talk to I was met with great resistance. No one wanted to help and after spending over four hours trying to find where my bag was I eventually left and gave up. The workers in the airport were incompetent. I never once raised my voice or had an angry attitude towards a worker, because I know that it’s not their fault that my bags were lost. However, I waited in baggage claim line for 45min waiting to get an answer on where my bag was. When I got to the front, the associate refused to scan my baggage slip and told me to go look in a pile of bags I already looked through. After telling the associate I had already gone through all the bags with other associates she just waived her hand at me to leave. The airport layout is horrendous and it feels like a run down mall instead of an airport. Everything is dirty and the seat availability is absolutely slim. There is very little seating for people who have to wait for flights. Even on a day with little to no delays you find yourself either shoulder to shoulder with someone or sitting on the floor. On my departure trip back to the airport I arrived, come to find out instead of holding my bag they lost for me to recheck, they sent it on a flight back to Dallas after we had already discussed over the phone I would pick it up myself in Miami. I got to the airport at approximately 8:30am and my flight didn’t board until 3:00pm. Since I was coming from a cruise I didn’t have much option but to wait in the airport. Since I entered the terminal there was a loud alarm that stated “may we have your attention”, “the current alarm in being investigated by the fire department, please standby for more instructions.” This alarm continued to go off every minute even after I got on my flight to leave. I understand the safety of having alarms, but it sounded like it had been going off for days. Seating was again slim and the restrooms were absolutely disastrous. Overall, if you plan on spending anytime at all at an airport make sure it is not in Miami. For an international airport I am shocked at how horrendous the experience is. The service and associates around the airport treat people nothing more than a ticket. 1/10 I am never coming back to this airport, I would rather spend hundreds of more dollars than spend another minute here.",-1
2023-01-10,0.7,Business,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,5.0,people like him is what we need,True,"  We arrive in a Avianca flight on the 9th January 2023 it was my mother, my sister and me, my sister knee was very bad and couldn't walk and a person by the name of Godfrey Glanville employee of DAS help us with a wheel chair, although he already had a person he wen lt above his call of duty to help me and my sister but the part about was that he was already pushing 2 wheel chairs and a bad when my mother who is 83 years old started to feel without a breath so he stop and went to get a 3rd wheelchair so now he was pushing 3 wheel chairs plus the bags, I will call him a life saver and a super hero, people like him is what we need and he should be in a management position as he understands the needs of other people and he knows how to create solutions and not excuse.",1
2023-01-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,could be the worst in the country,True,"  Miami Airport could be the worst in the country. Today Jan 9, 2023, around 500 people (and the line kept getting longer) were in line at the US citizens passport control an only TWO agents were working. Absolutely insane. I had a connecting flight and security check was a madhouse on top of that the TSA agent with whom I dealt yelled and yelled at people. I asked her not to yell and she yelled back at me. And she kept yelling. Disgustingly unprofessional behavior. This airport’s service has gone from bad to worse.",-1

Baggage takes forever. They don’t honor priority access or baggage. Fort Lauderdale is better but Miami sucks relative to all airports nationwide.,-1
2022-12-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,chaos referred to as the Miami Airport,False,"  There is no possible way to accurately describe the chaos referred to as the Miami Airport. If one is an international flier arriving at this airport, the chaos begins with trying to secure luggage. People running into each other in a tiny pedestrian lane occupied by persons entering and exiting the baggage area. No accurate signage for direction, just a few employees in yellow vests waving their arms. Next is the reloading of baggage prior to entering Immigration then TSA. Because of a recent knee replacement, I was relegated to the scanner line. Little movement of the line due to a break down of the ONE machine. We were directed to the metal detector whereby the agent just waved us through (the machine beeped, but was flag through anyway). Next was our quest to find Terminal E (gate 30). Signage was confusing. Nobody to direct. Found a flight attendant who directed us to a Skytrain, it could not adequately explain where to go next. A stroke of luck took us to the gate. We were in the last boarding group which was being called as we approached the gate. We have traveled to some second tiered countries that are better equipped to handle passengers in an organized manner. This is no way to run an airport. One that I will avoid at all costs.",-1
2022-12-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Avoid it like the plague!,False,  Horrible airport. Probably the only country in the world where you have to pay for a baggage cart. $28 for a glass of wine. Unfriendly staff. Avoid it like the plague!,-1
2022-11-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,2.0,0.0,,,,a real shame for this country,True,"  Miami International Airport, specifically the area of arrivals, is a real shame for this country; my country! First of all, the cleaning of the areas once the passenger disembark from the airplane there were even water leaks from the roof with plastic containers to collect the falling water. The conveyors to help passengers walk to the passport control area did not work. Once the passenger gets into the immigration area, there were just a few positions active so the lines were incredibly long; we, my wife and I, wasted a least one hour after a long journey of ten. And we were on the US Citizens line; I cannot imagine the waiting time for foreign visitors. This is not the quality level that we can expect from the most avance country over the world! This is not the image we should be exposing to our visitors. Besides, we, the Citizens, deserve a better treatment!",-1
2022-11-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,two and a half hours getting through security,False,"  We left Cancun and had a layover in Miami. When we arrived at the Miami airport, we were required to go through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection process since we were reentering the U.S. The line was very long and there was no sense of urgency by the staff to help customers. Despite having many booths to help folks, there was just four employees manning them, and all but one employee worked at a very slow pace. After spending an hour in the Customs line we then proceeded to get our luggage. No staff member explained that we needed to pick up our luggage and take it to another location. Once we figured out what needed to be done we then proceeded to security. Once we arrived there, the line was crazy long and it took over an hour to get through that line. The staff there also worked at a very slow pace. We spent over two and a half hours getting through security and customs which caused us to miss our connecting flight. There were many people in line with us who also complained about poor customer service, slow service, and lack of coordination by the staff. In fact, a lot of other people missed their connecting flights as a result of this disaster. I hope I never had to visit the Miami airport again.",-1

The Seats, the carpets, the restrooms, restaurant floors, the carpets have dark stains all over and everything smells horrible. Our TSA welcome very early in the morning was an employee with a very bad attitude and demeanor. Very dissatisfied.",-1
2022-11-11,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,one of the worst airports in the US,False,"  This is one of the worst airports in the US. The transit gateway from entering and passing through customs is the worst. Not only are TSA agents rude and unprofessional, the layout of the airport is terrible. I have had stuff stolen here from me when I put it down, as well as having to run from one side of the airport to the other sprinting to catch the next flight. The airport is super rundown and I don’t know how American Airlines is using this as their hub to South America. I have global entry and the transit from checkin a bag in to go through domestic is a joke. Then the line to the transit from Internstional to domestic takes 30 minutes. It’s better to just exit and re-enter through. This could have saved me 30 minutes. The food selection is terrible and there isn’t much else appealing but I’m going to South America for work and leisure so this is the worst part of my journey.",-1
2022-11-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,worst airport in the country,False,"  Miami airport is hands-down the very worst airport in the country. It’s unconscionable that they make you walk over 3/4 of a mile ( Measured it on an exercise app) to get from your arrival gate to passport control. Long long Corredor‘s 75% without any people mover walkways, and of the few people Movers at least half were broken and non-functioning. Then after passport control it’s almost another 3/4 of a mile to get your baggage recheck it and get to your connection gate. Senior citizens and kids, everybody has to walk this far. It was exactly the same thing last time I came through Miami last August. Hands-down the very worst airport in the country! Whoever managers this airport should be fired immediately for incompetence!",-1
2022-10-18,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,3,,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,has improved over the years,True,"  Return flight with BA to T5 Heathrow. Dropped off the Hire Car at the spookily quiet car rental centre (car sat nav and then good signage made it easy from the I95), and got the shuttle train to the relatively quiet Terminal. Easy to find the BA check in desks, queues not too bad and after 15 minutes we went through Security. Found the American Airlines Flagship Lounge (near Gate D 30) and checked in with a glass of champagne. Sat doiwn to find that my wife had left her cell phone at security in one of the plastic trays. A half hour search back at the security gate, and with the help of security staff and a fellow passenger and thankfully she found it. A big Thank you to those staff and the passenger - one relieved wife. Don't know whether this is a trend but we have found Miami International has improved over the years - far, far better than it was, say, 15 years ago. Would, on this basis, recommend.",1
2022-10-10,0.1,Business,1,1,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,A very disorganized airport,True," A very disorganized airport. Wait until you read this! We arrived from Madrid into their international terminal. We had a connecting flight to our final destination. Our bags were checked from Madrid through to our final destination. Customs worked smoothly with Global Entry. Then we needed to pick up our luggage before we could drop baggage off for our final destination. It took 50 minutes for our bags to come. We then had to take our bags into the Main Terminal to the American Check in location. Needless to say, we along with many other people missed their connecting flight. Just saying, most international airports have a system in place where you put your bags on the conveyer belt after going through customs. I have never had to go get in line again in the main terminal. Please avoid Miami, I would say its a step below Atlanta.",-1
2022-09-18,0.9,Couple Leisure,5,4,,5.0,0.0,,,,not have asked for 3 nicer people to meet,False,"  My boyfriend and I had a very stressful experience losing 2 phones at this airport until TSA agent Lilliam (liliana) Rodriguez saved the day by finding our phone and tracking us down to help return it just before departing on our connecting flight. For hours we ran around the airport begging for help and were turned around in different directions by many employees that didn’t want to take the time to deal with it. We are so grateful for Miss Rodriguez’s kindness so that we didn’t miss our connecting flight! Also, another kind woman at lost and found on the 4th floor, whose name I did not catch, was very helpful and giving of her time. There was also a very nice tall man who worked near terminal D25 that was so incredibly kind and offered to walk the airport until we met Rodriguez. I could not have asked for 3 nicer people to meet today. Thank you all for being understanding human beings and helping turn our chaotic day around to make it a little better.",1

2022-09-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Customer service is non existent"" ",False,"  Customer service is non existent compared to other airports. They have many information desks...but no-one is there at night or weekends. The elevators and moving walkways are broken. Some employees don't even speak English. What kind of message is Miami trying to send? Management is only interested in money...how much money they can make. They are not spending it on the people who make that airport a money maker. And when you complain, all you get is how much they try...but management does not support the front line employees. We have traveled to 5 different airports this year and every one of them show support to us when we have a question or problem. We will travel the extra 45 minutes to Ft Lauderdale where they care about passengers.",-1
2022-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,I had a horrible experience,True,  I had a horrible experience at Miami Airport. We are a military family. My husband and I are traveling with an infant. I tried to check in on the Spirit app and they only provided me with my husband’s boarding pass. It said I had to go to special assist at the airport to get mine and the baby’s boarding pass. We arrived an hour and 45 mins before our flight. We were dropped off at the departure gate for Spirit but the check in was all the way on the other side of the airport on a lower level. We checked our stroller and car seat with our bag. We then had to walk back to the gate where the TSA line said 15 mins. The line of people did not reflect the estimated time. We tried to go through the tsa pre check line but the representative would only speak to me in Spanish and we were ignored by many. We also told many airport staff that we aren’t going to make it on our flight. No one cared. The tsa line took 45 mins to get through. My husband ran to the gate because it was no where near the line and the gate was closed even though it was still 5 mins before departure. After running with an infant in my arms we missed our flight by 6 mins. We could not make it back to check in to request my child’s items because of how far away check in is from the gate. Now I’m stranded in the Miami airport and have no way to transport my infant.,-1
2022-07-31,0.3,Couple Leisure,4,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,staff at the bag scanner downright rude,False, The staff working at the bag scanner was just downright rude. Yelling at me to push up the trays without even giving me a chance to do so. The bags were so backed up it's not like there was a reason to rush. If I spoke to people at my work like that I would be fired.,1
2022-07-22,0.3,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,2.0,it was unbelievably horrible,True,"  I’ve always preferred FLL when traveling to visit family in Colombia because of streamlined customs process, but last summer in MIA, everything was good. Today it was unbelievably horrible. Right away, 2 out of 4 people movers were inoperative. Given the actual 1/2 mile to walk, this was not appropriate. Initial customs was not bad but then everyone was screened again! Usually they spot check but today, there was one PO’d girl checking passports and only one screening lane open. A guy was walking back and forth saying to put tablets and computers separate and shoes and belts off. The crowd was getting impatient when some young group cut the line. A supervisor was called out and they were sent back after some yelling and shouting. Finally another lane opened right as we were up front. Then as we were taking shoes and belts off the agent said “why are you pulling your computers out?” I had the regrettable audacity to inform him the the other agent was shouting those instructions to the crowd. That annoyed him so we stuffed the laptop and tablet back into their case and moved on to baggage claim and re-check.so why don’t they screen all bags again if all people are being scanned again after being in a contained environment? This was bizarre and chaotic at the very least and unprofessional at worst. Unless my life depends on it I will avoid MIA for the 2 years I have left before moving to Colombia.",-1

Staff not very helpful or knowledgeable. If you have time before going through boarder control look around the shops as only 1 after going through customs. There is a small bar and the gent behind it was lovely. At the British Airways wait area there are usb ports but charge faster with the usa plug adaptor - nothing else apart from toilets and fending machines.

This airport was the worst experience I've ever had in an airport. Had a 9pm flight and all of the food options were outside of TSA. One in the terminal all of the stores to purchase snacks closed at 8pm. So your stuck with no food options so eat before you go. The check in process is a joke. everything is so spread out.

Arrived 3.5 hours prior to our flight to drop off the hire car. The Car Rental Centre is a decent set up but a relatively long way from the airport. Lots of walking, escalators and a train to get to the check in area. Long lines at British Airways check in with only two agents working behind the six available desks. Bag drop took nearly two hours. TSA security wasn't as bad but still took 30 minutes. Briefly stopped at the small Duty Free shop before heading to the gate by which time our flight was already boarding. All in all a very tiresome experience which did not make me want to use Miami again.",-1

This time, more of the same with the lines for customs being ridiculously long, but that's normal for them. I also wanted some transport info as I has a long stopover, and walked to 3 different information counters. Not one of them was manned by any staff member! All were automated with a button to call. I called repeatedly but it rang and rang with no answer. Ok, I finally figured it out on my own after a bunch of time wasted, and took the airport tram to the public transport area. Again, no one was behind the information booth. I honestly don't think the people in charge care much for customer service. Extremely poor customer service and extremely poor logistics with this sorry excuse for an airport.",-1

Infrastructure relatively new, but seems that the architect was on holiday and facilities were haphazardly put together. It took us over an hour to get to car rental counters - after walking about a mile and taking two trains! We had to walk half a mile to take train to claim our luggage, then walked another half a mile to take Miami mover train to car rental terminal! What a disastrous airport planning!",-1

People queue up for this farce to go 2 at a time with a random stranger, and instructed to ""walk at the exactly then same pace."" Then the dog is led into the swirl of air created by those two, plus everyone else crammed around them. The people are then herded into a line of 5 credential booths, but if everyone doesn’t go all the way to the last one, they are yelled at for not listening and causing inefficiency. The closer 4 credential booths are then filled when the one further along overflows. I have never seen anything so frustrating and demeaning in a US airport.",-1

If you are flying out of this airport (even in the earliest hours of the day or at night) prepare to waste a lot of time at security checkpoint. I spent 1.5hr on a TSA line because they had one TSA Officer checking identification. One? Are you kidding me? Finally they decided to open another scanner machine but then my flight door was closing. Of course I missed my flight and so did a few other people because of this. Very inefficient process. Also the airport is old and Miami desperately needs another one.,-1

I can not understand how they expect business when they are haughty and disrespectful to all who cross the threshold. Horrible experience.

I am used to the way I am treated rudely at airport security by not being helped for a while, but the Miami airport was really BAD! I sat FOREVER at security waiting to get patted down, & when someone finally came, she helped a girl who came WAY after me because she stopped the line (she was on a scooter with a broken leg & in the “normal people” line, instead of being off to the side, like me). The lady who came from security looked right at me & said nothing (like, “I’ll get to you in a minute”), & took the scooter, & closed the door! I was furious! Wished I could yell. They treated me so badly at security that by the time I left, I cried. To top it off, the airport was so cold I could barely move my fingers to sign or type to my husband about it!

Huge lines, absolute no prioritisation over people who are late. No one around to talk to. No directions. Staff has no clue what is going on. Worst airport ever.

The airport employees are rude, just saying use your eyes to find a seat to put your shoes back on, seriously. American service is definitely not what it used to be. This airport is filthy - the departures lounges treated in such a bad way with rubbish such as food boxes and empty bottles left on seating, left on the floor - left everywhere, no garbage trash cans for it. With Covid 19 cleanliness should be a priority - here it is not, people in TSA line not even 6 fts apart. I've been flying for over 20 years, and never seen such a sad airport.

Staff were less than helpful, TSA was disorganized and simply ignoring people trying to go through the screening, and ""valet"" baggage check people were genuinely rude.

It taught me a valuable lesson. Never, ever, use this airport for your international connections. They won't certify this review but all you have to do is look at all the previous reviews for the exact same issues weeks and months ago. Woefully understaffed, contract security couldn't even answer questions like. Which line is which and these appeared to be supervisory personnel. They were so bad they couldn't keep the lines organized and there were no signs no directions. The TSA were just as bad. We travel internationally a couple of times a year and have never had to go back through screening after clearing customs and immigration. Maybe rules have changed, but the TSA was overwhelmed. It was kind of sad actually. Dozens and dozens of passengers from any airline coming through on 2/20 in the evening, missed their connections due to poorly trained and poorly supervised personnel. If you don't have at least a four hour cushion to make your connection you won't make it. Just imagine what it will be like when the airports get really busy. Use Charlotte instead.",-1

Flight from Barbados arrived 100% on time, and was even acknowledged by the gate clerk who rebooked me on standby the next morning. Connection left a number of us stranded when Miami Airport was understaffed and got our luggage to us late for transfer, and couldn’t get us through the line in time. I’m sleeping in the airport tonight as AA is taking no responsibility for not holding the plane and leaving us all behind. I’ve been flying for 5 decades and this may be the most disgraceful and incompetent handling of a trip I’ve ever seen.",-1
2022-02-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Worst airport I have experienced,True,"  Worst airport I have experienced in the United States and I fly about once per month. American Airlines terminal security checkpoint took 1.5 hours to get through. I have not seen lines like this since shortly after 9/11. To make matters worse, TSA and MIA employees were doing nothing to assist in keeping the lines organized or moving forward. This entire process was a free for all. Once in the gate area, there is almost no where to charge electronic devices in the gate areas besides one desk with two electrical outlets. The American Airlines customer service was terrible and had multiple gate changes. The gates in this airport can also be extremely far apart and one gate change took almost 15 minutes to walk to without an easier and accessible way to speed this up such as a walking escalator. I ordered food at Wendy’s thinking this would be the quickest possible food and gave up waiting for my food after I had been waiting for 30 minutes. Overall, I can confidently say my experience at Miami International was the worse travel experience I have had in the last two decades. I will make a conscious effort to avoid flying into or connecting through MIA if at all possible.",-1

Only 1 TSA agent checking ID and 1 belt running. Because of this we missed our flight. Had to stand in line another 1.5 hours in a “rebooking line.” What should have been a direct 3.5 hour flight turned into an all day marathon at 3 different airports.

I am totally mortified at the service of this ""Great Nation"", it's attitude towards its visitors is shocking. We were only there for a connecting flight which the rude and extremely unhelpful staff made us miss. Disorganised, over priced, dirty. Apart from the guy that helped us after we missed our connecting flight which there was absolutely no time for due to the queues at passport control and then back in through security check. There were no signs showing where to go for connecting flights. We found the connection flight queue eventually after being stuffed in a huge snake like queue, packed in like sardines. At one point, a guy started letting all the US Nationals through to get their queue down and they took preference over the connecting flights. We only had 35 mins to board by this point. Needless to say flight missed. One horrid woman was so nasty to me when we missed our flight (which I sprinted through the airport to get to) I was stunned. A really horrid, unnecessarily stressful, disorganised experience. Never again! I give minus points. I do not recommend.",-1

Going through customs is always a mess, with long wait times for bags, disorganized rechecking of baggage, and then subsequent security checks that make you almost miss your connecting flights. The lines are always long, the TSA agents are so disrespectful, rude, and separate families who should be together all with TSA pre check. It is always a crapshoot knowing what rules and regulations they are going to enforce and then be rude to you about when you either do the maximum expected protocols, or don’t because the list literally says you don’t have to (take your shoes off, take your belt off or wallet out with an expedited screening.) Such a mess and I feel like I am literally in a foreign country. No staff speaks English to you, they all start out in Spanish and expect you to talk to them in Spanish.

The security line on a Sunday morning was over an hour and a half long, and literally snaked through the terminal. As of the time of this review, the following airlines use the G gates: Bahamasair, Southwest, Sun Country, and United Airlines. There is only one TSA checkpoint that serves this concourse, zero signs for TSA PreCheck, and clueless employees attempting to organize the chaos. Additionally, the contracted employees that work at the airport (working for a third-party employer rather than actual airline employees) are absolutely miserable, and treat customers like they're an inconvenience. I think the larger D gates at the airport offer a better experience as there are four TSA entry points. The G gates, with minimal seating, an air conditioner that barely works, and next to nothing for food options, are a nightmare.",-1

Absolute shambles of an immigration service at Miami airport. When I first arrived, I thought long queue, yes, but 40 terminals, this shouldn't be too bad. I noticed were were moving fairly slowly and then, as I first glimpsed it, the horror hit. For us 'non-citizens' only 27 terminals were available, doesn't sound too bad still however there were only 2 (two - I have to put it in brackets as it is barely believable), officers on duty for us So for the 3 flights of majority 'non-citizens' that had recently arrived (my approximation at least 400) we were being served by 2 officers. Well as you can imagine, considering they like to ask an awful lot of questions and take photos and fingerprints and all of that, it took an awful long time (4hrs by my count). Didn't even get a stamp in my passport (because of COVID) alright for people to stand in close proximity to each other for 4hrs though!

We then had to get our luggage from baggage claim at the other end? We then had to go check our bags in again? (Why couldn’t they just transport our bags like a typical airport?) Next, we waited at TSA for so so long. We were told to move to different lines 3 times, each at different locations. The TSA staff was insanely rude, despite letting them know (nicely) we were about to miss our connecting flight. We then had to run across the entire airport to almost miss our flight.

We had been through two different airports on two different continents, for me to arrive for a transfer in my home country. Only in the US was I treated horribly. It started with the Global Entry ""staff"". The man at the desk that verifies the receipt from the kiosk was rude to everyone we saw him interact with, including a man traveling with his young daughter. He yelled at this man for not clearing his child through Global Entry. Next we got to experience collecting our bags for the international transfer. There was no person working in the baggage claim area to answer any questions, such as if we had to do the transfer ourselves. Next we had to check in to Copa Airlines. Rudest airline I have ever dealt with in my travels. Then 34 USD for a beer and small Moscow Mule. Overall the experience in Miami was the low point of our trip. I will not travel through there again. I recommend you avoid the place like the COVID-19.",-1

She screamed at me to get away if I can’t read signs. I was standing under a do not enter sign attempting to talk to her. All she would do is yell at me in a different language I could not understand. It’s this kind of attitude that I as a business owner would not tolerate.

Never have I ever experienced any 1 security line with more than 4 checkpoints at each terminal. On top of this with covid travel numbers. Security doesn't care if you miss flight and they actively laugh at you while living through high stress and anxiety. They have all the tools to make it run smoothly, they have unprofessional and sloth moving people. Covid has created an apathy to get people to work. How are we supposed to get back to work if no one actually wants to do their job. Not once was a supervisor present to get things moving. I also checked the security wait times online in the MIA airport and they were completely inaccurate.

After waiting in lines for about 40 minutes to get through customs, you have to literally exit the airport. There is no signage for connection flights, you just have to go the baggage claim. From baggage claim you have to collect your checked baggage. Again no signage. You then have to go completely back through security. Anything you bought at your last airport, duty free, any liquids will be thrown out. Again zero signage giving you a heads up that you might want to check anything you've bought while stuck at your last airports. So heads up, this airport is terrible.

We were shouted into a queue to take our photo and fingerprints on a machine and then shouted at again to get into yet another queue with hundreds of people waiting to see a Customs Officer. We were told to present a copy of the photo we already had taken at the machine. He did exactly the same thing as we had already done and took yet another photo but, this time taking fingerprints of both hands. What an absolute joke this airport is. The rudeness of one of the officials astounded us. He must have been an ex serviceman or police officer in a former life. He was aggressive and treated everybody as if they were 10 years old. He shouted at anybody that did not get in the correct line. It is really not acceptable to have these sort of people working in this environment. This has put us off visiting Miami/Florida again. Look at the other reviews, it says it all!",-1
2020-02-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,Not professional at all,False,"  Arrived from Barcelona and cleared customs with sufficient time to get aboard an earlier departure flight to my next destination. The Departures sign board indicated the gate as D 9 (if memory serves), so we quickly followed the signs towards corridor D. But guess what, even though one hallway was clearly marked with a D (and an arrow) it had a barrier across the entrance and a big floor sign: No Admittance. So back we went to the main corridor, where we saw directional arrows for Gates D-E etc, so down that corridor we race, looking for an American Rebooking desk. None in sight, anywhere, despite this being a major American hub. Stopped at one gate that was staffed and asked where the rebooking desk was, and was told it was something like D-37 or D-3, and then the agent volunteered that one might be a little closer, so off in that direction we ran. When we finally got there, we were told that the doors had already been closed (never mind that it would have been about a 15 minute walk to get there anyway). So we resigned ourselves to an interminable wait down near D-1, where a bottled beer was ""only"" $10.50, not counting tax and a ""suggested tip of $1.50."" When it finally was near time for the departure for the later flight, suddenly there was a flurry of activity at the adjacent gates, when apparently four American flights were to depart within 15 minutes of one another from gates D-1 to D-5. And since there seemed to be only one PA, the assembled passengers became understandably restless when the gate attendant announced ""we are now boarding Groups 1 and 2"" without bothering to state the destination or flight number. Confusing? You bet. Especially when said announcement was drowned out by another PA telling ""passenger XXX, please report to the gate."" Final boarding began when five wheelchairs were rolled to the plane, followed very quickly by anyone who simply showed his/her boarding pass and walked aboard. There was only one American gate agent on duty, apparently all the others were still dealing with the adjacent flights. Not professional at all.",-1

I used mobile pass and went through and asked the person which queue to get into, and she said 35 or 36. I went to 36, and the officer at the desk said I was in the wrong line. I asked him which line was the correct one and pointed at the woman behind us (she was maybe 10 feet behind me) and said ""she told me to go to this line"" and he just waived randomly to the other 35 lines and said ""back there"". He did not even bother looking up from his cell phone. So, I went back to the woman who had told me originally that it was line 35 or 36, and she said, ""oh, I meant 34 or 35."" (We were standing right in front of lines 34, 35, and 36.) She seriously could not have been less concerned that she's giving out misinformation. The officer in line 36 also could not be bothered to simply say the queue right next to him was the correct one. Seriously. They are useless, and do not even attempt to improve. They should all be fired for their attitudes and giving out incorrect information. This is not the first time I've had a terrible experience flying through Miami and I avoid it whenever possible.",-1
2020-01-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,3.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,disgusted with the level of nastiness and ignorance,True," Absolutely disgusted with the level of nastiness and ignorance by the employees. Our tickets told us to go to terminal H. Once we passed security and went to our gate we were told it had changed to G. The security at G wouldn't let us pass because the tickets said terminal H. It took us forever to persuade them that the flight terminal and gate were changed. At this point my mother-in-law couldn't walk anymore because we were standing in line forever and she is elderly and has diabetes. When we asked for help several employees sneered and were sarcastic asking if they should roll out the red carpet for us. It was just the two of us and 4 kids. My daughter had dropped hot water on her chest just an hour before and was treated by first responders (who were absolutely amazing) at the Military Lounge, so I couldn't help her, my mother-in-law, and the other 3 kids all at the same time. Because my MIL could barely walk we were talking to each other that chances are we'd miss our flight, at which point one of the TSA agents started yelling how she didn't care and sat for over 10 mins without letting me have my shoes or my daughter's ice pouch the first responders gave us. They absolutely refused to let us keep the aloe we were given by the medics because I refused to show them my daughter's burned chest! She is 7! She was already distressed because of the second degree burns. She had huge blisters on her belly and chest that were treated by the medics and bandaged. Where is your humanity? Is your life so miserable you need to take it out on a little girl who sat in pain for 4 hours because you couldn't let her have her medicine? How dare you ask to see my daughter's bare chest to confirm she has burns? It's called HIPAA for a reason. You are not a medical professional. Is your day better because you managed to put down a military spouse, her four children and her mother-in-law? I cannot believe these are the people my husband serves and protects.",-1

All staff are so rude but also in their defence look very stressed. The airport security is just plain weird, you go down this weird slope, all the staff are chatting to each other grunting at customers and I would say not throughly checking each individual! I went to walk through the security scanner and it was clearly half working it out when I walked through the lady asked me to pause, I waited 2 minutes expecting to be asked to go back through - nope! She looked at me up and down shrugged her shoulders and let me through now that is just crazy! The carpets smell too, the decor is stuck in the 70-80’s whenever the airport was built and they have done nothing to jazz anything up a bit. The departure area consists of a small bar and a Pizza Hut, always a huge queue in each because there is nowhere else to go.

2019-08-21,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,hardly words to describe how abysmal this airport is,False,"  There are hardly words to describe how abysmal this airport is. I had 2 hours to make a connection from Mexico City to Hartford. American Airlines should have known better than to book such a short layover through this wretched place. The plane was delayed 15 minutes on the tarmac and then 10 more at the gate when no agent was available to operate the entryway. Then, there was an interminable walk through unmarked hallways to an interminable immigration line. There, after being herded to the automated kiosks, I was herded to wait over 40 minutes for an agent who was gleefully asking smug questions of every U.S. citizens in line, spending an average of 5 minutes with each person. Other lines moved more quickly at this point, so this is clearly a particular agent’s power trip. At this point, when I tried to find where to re-check my luggage, an agent rudely asked me for when my connnection was. This was the first time I was asked about my connection time, notwithstanding the “short layover” stickers that had been plastered all over my suitcase. At this point, the rude American Airlines employee told me to go to a different line from the one which I was standing, with now explanation. I assumed, incorrectly, that this was an expedited line, since I still had around 40 minutes to catch my flight. It was not. The door that the rude agent sent me through took me outside of security to the airline agents for rebooking. I learned from another agent that I had been sent there because other agents decided that the remaining 40 minutes was not sufficient for me to make my connection. And, throughout the process, the half-dozen or so staff members that I had the misfortune of interacting with were extraordinarily rude and impassive to the fact that they were part of an inefficient and abusive machine that was making thousands of passengers miserable. Unfortunately, I need to make this same trip for work several times a year. In the future, it will cost me around a hundred dollars to book itineraries on a different airline (probably Delta) in order to avoid this airport. It will be worth every penny.",-1

Some are acceptable, others are good, and a few are excellent. MIA is in a category by itself. Apart from the worst parking facilities I have ever encountered and an urgent need to improve its shoddy appearance, the immigration service seems to consist mostly of incompetent agents. After sitting in the Interjet airliner for a full hour after boarding and a flight of about two and a half hours, it took my wife and little granddaughter another three hours to pass through immigration and customs. Such gross inefficiency and total lack of caring for passenger needs is reprehensible. Those responsible for running such an operation should be relieved of their jobs and replaced by competent personnel. Clearly, the travelling public deserves something better than this. Our family will surely not be the only one to avoid using this airport for our future travel needs.",-1

This was to service a full load of passengers from a Boeing 777. It wasn't until I had spent two and a half hours waiting in the queue that they finally opened some additional desks. It took 3 hours just to have my passport checked! It took 30 minutes at Montego Bay in Jamaica. I spoke to a couple, who missed their connecting flight by 5 minutes, due to the unacceptable time waiting in this queue and as a result, lost 1 day of their holiday, Fort Worth Texas, was quicker but still took over an hour. When I asked if there was anyway of speeding up the process, as it was quite likely that I would miss my connecting flight back to the UK, the airport staff just stated that there was nothing to be done in order to speed the process up.

The immigration queues were endless, and most of the desks were closed. We had to jump through the queues for immigration officers (thank you to those who allowed us to do so) having already waited an hour to use the machines.

2019-04-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,poor management,True," Zero stars if I could rate that low. We sat in the runway for 35-45 minutes after arrival from Barbados - the reasoning because of “other aircraft that needed to taxi”. Go ahead and start the stop watch. We needed to make a connecting flight to Richmond, and we only had an hour to get to our other aircraft. Well 35 minutes wasted sitting in the runway. Thank you either aircraft controllers or American Airlines. Once we were off the plane (another 10 minutes after waiting on the runway ) we made our way through one customs line where literally 500 hundred people were waiting. We waited in customs for another hour - at this point our plane had already started boarding for Richmond. After making it through the customs checks, there were 6 other customs officers sitting around talking and laughing (twiddling their thumbs) Maybe they could have helped open up more lanes in customs? No - poor management. To add on top of all of this, the one line was full of Miami residents that did not need to make a connecting flight. Maybe they could have opened up a different line for solely connecting flights? No - poor management. After customs we then had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and recheck our luggage! I get this was American Airlines however this was another wasted 30 minutes. After all of this was said and done all but one American line was open so our so called “pre-check passes were useless “After talking with a behind the counter representative from American, they would not reimburse us for a hotel or could they guarantee a seat in the next flight to Richmond. After staying the night in Miami on our expense, we arrived to our gate and American Airlines informed us only seat was available and that my wife could go ahead while I had to wait for another flight 10 hours later. But guess what? This was not a guaranteed seat either. Looks like I’ll be staying in Miami until the I purchase my own set of tickets again. All in all, this was a nightmare that the airport or American Airlines did not want to admit to their poorly planned schematics of arrivals and connecting flights. Hands down the worst flying experience I have ever encountered. - thank you TSA, Customs and American Airlines for ruining my trip. You can check me off your list of being a returning customer. I hope 1000s will read this so they can be forewarned of possible miseries. Something that could have been completely avoided if Miami knew how to run an airport.",-1

We are currently sat in the admirals lounge in the flagship area for Oneworld passengers and the service and food are disappointing.

2019-02-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,worst airport in the modern world,True," The worst airport I’ve ever had to navigate. We had a 3 hours layover where we were coming in from London. 1. Air traffic control had us circle for 20 minutes. Ok, that happens. 2. Once we landed we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes due to another plane not having docked correctly? and lack of communication regarding which gates the preceding planes were to be at. This doesn’t really happen much, so it was frustrating. 3. We had to go through two different rounds of security screening before having to pick up our checked bags. At the first one, even though we’re had the mobile passport completed, there was no line for mobile passport and with 6 kiosks only 2 were open; one exclusively for crew and global entry with the other for everyone else. 4. We had to then collect our luggage, which took another 30 minutes, to be randomly selected to have them rummage through our things. 5. Once they unfolded everything and left it a mess we were dismissed and sent towards the exit. We then had to recheck our bags at the airline desk which was on a different level and a long way away. Luckily, an airline staff member allowed us to skip the line and simply drop the bags. This was the one person who was helpful; airline staff. 6. Next we had to go through airport security again, however, this time it was the same security you go through if you were just arriving to the airport. Keep in mind we had just gotten off of an airplane here at the airport. Once in the line we got to hurry up and wait while 6 TSA employees condescendingly yelled at everyone. Nothing helpful from them, just threats to slow the line if their power-trip-orders weren’t obeyed. If someone failed to zip up their backpack before sending it through the scanner, instead of asking them to zip it, the person was chastised in front of the crowd. 7. The line of travelers constantly growing while the Walmart approach (having many registers with only one open) was adopted by the TSA staff. One screening conveyor belt was in use while 3 others were closed. With the exception of the lady who was running the conveyor belt, who would not make eye contact with anyone even when asked why my sealed clear bag from the duty free store back in a London was set aside. Nope, my duty free items needed to be taken out and run through another scanner. 8. What was the rest of the TSA staff doing? Literally walking around in circles not know who was supposed to do what. I heard “hey, who is on this one?” And “I though so and so was supposed to be here still” along with other statements that really reassured me our safety was the priority and was being handled by professionals. 9. We were reassured that once through this last “security” check that the gate was literally just up another escalator. Nope. Next we had to jump on yet another shuttle. 10. What’s the best part of this whole experience. The arrival gate (e24) was in the same terminal as the departure gate (e31). All of that fuss was to go through customs. In short, this is the worst airport in the modern world to deal with and I will gladly pay more to fly through another airport in the future so that I can avoid this from happening again.",-1
2019-02-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,An awful experience,True," Oh dear no. An awful experience. When you stand in a queue for an hour and 15 minutes with no access to a toilet and nowhere to sit it leaves a bad taste. I have to remind myself as meander like I’m in a queue at Disney that we are meant to be in the most advanced 1st world country on earth. I mean the citizens of this country landed men on the moon 50 years ago and sent satellites to the furthest edges of our solar system yet they can’t efficiently push people through airport arrivals. So after an hour and 15 minutes in a queue we were put into an area of robotic machines by semi robotic staff. One must put the four fingers of one hand on a glass plate on the machine, feed their passport into a slot and look at a light for the machine to take your photograph as if you are facing prison. The machine then spits out a paper ticket with your photo and passport details. In our case although the ticket told us to proceed out one of the semi robotic staff put us to another darn queue. This one took another 45 minutes and when we got to the counter we got to do it all over again. That’s to say, fingerprinted, photographed and passport examined. So what moron thinks it’s a good idea to push hundreds of people to machines only to then put them to human beings to do the exact same thing all over again? Insane duplication and a complete waste of time. I think the Germans call this verschlimmbesserung. So two hours with no access to water, toilet or a seat and to make matters much much worse was that whenever airline crew arrived they got preference over us to go through immigration with no consideration for the fact we’d been standing for hours. When I arrived at the airport I had a lot of sympathy for the folks working here because with the 21st century reincarnation of PT Barnum in the White House they weren’t getting paid but by the time I was standing an hour I felt I wouldn’t pay them either. Barnum may be on capitol hill but arrivals at Miami airport was a horrible circus all of its own.",-1

",False,"  The airport is not very customer friendly. I was to go to Terminal E for both trips through Miami and I must say the E is clearly the reject terminal. It’s disconnected from the main terminal and plenty hard to get to. Even with the train, it’s still an awkward and seemingly unnecessary drag of a walk. I’d consider myself an able-bodied, active and healthy young woman but I can only imagine being a passenger who needs more time and assistance to make it from point A to B. Terminal E (the reject) has the worst food and store accommodations I have ever seen. There is very little variety and no real restaurants. It’s pretty pathetic. If I hadn’t spent all that trouble trying to get to E, I would have doubled back to eat in D.",-1
2018-12-11,0.4,Couple Leisure,3,1,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,,not impressed with the experience,False,"  My husband and I flew into the Miami airport on Saturday, December 1 to connect with a cruise that was sailing that day. Our time in the airport was minimal as we were able to quickly locate the transfer service to the port and we were on our way in a short time. On Saturday, December 8 we returned to the Miami airport to await our return flight to Toronto. We arrived at the airport about 9.30 am and our flight was not until 2.00 pm so we had 4.5 hours to spend at the airport and we were not impressed with the experience. Upon getting off the transfer bus, we were directed to an outdoor counter to check our bags. This counter had minimal protection from the weather and we would have been quite uncomfortable if it had been raining or if we had been there mid-day in the hot sun. As others have mentioned, the cost of simple drink and snack options is extremely expensive. Several outlets did not even post prices but just a menu with a list of options. We settled on a coke, coffee and sandwich from the Starbucks outlet situated near gate D32. This location was convenient, well staffed and very clean. The major disappointment concerned the overall unkept state of the airport. There was a lot of garbage blowing around the waiting area where we checked our bags. The washrooms were filthy and the paper towel dispensers were empty. There were plenty of garbage cans but they were overflowing with trash.",-1
2018-12-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,4,4,,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,the immigration was fully manned,True," Arrived on a British Airways flight flying Club World so one of the first passengers off the plane and managed to be the first at immigration. I had an Esta and was expecting to use a machine. But arriving at the E terminal, the immigration was fully manned. The agent was very quick, took my photo, surprised there was no finger printing and no stamp on my passport and didn’t want my customs form. As I left the terminal no one wanted to collect my customs form, seems the process has changed. Anyway I was from plane door to kerb in 20 minutes. I was only in Miami overnight before connecting to Sint Maarten. Used AA priority check in and there was a short queue. Took the agent a while to check me in (I was wondering if there were problems with my paperwork and was suspecting the immigration agent screwed up the previous evening). Eventually she checked me in she all documents were fine. I used the business class security line at the D gates and was through security in 15 minutes. I wanted to use the AA Flagship lounge at gate D30 (Lounge was excellent). I needed plenty of time to walk to my flight at gate D3. But it was a pleasant 10 minute hike. Gate area was a mess. Although I was in group 1 boarding it was hogged up by people from groups 2 and 3. But gate agents were great at policing the boarding process. I agree the prices at MIA are outrages. $3.50 for a bottle of water!",1

Lousy food, nobody there cares the least about quality, and they charge huge prices. $17 for a lousy burger at Spring Chicken, 10 oz tap beer is $9.50, Islander Bar & Grill near D8 shows certain prices out front only to find that for a margarita you order house version they charge for Patron Silver, they charge separately for mix and tequila so it gets to $16. Two very lousy margaritas and one Heineken $48! When you inquire about that they just say, ""Hey, its in the airport! What do you expect?"" MIA is a complete rip-off! Spent over $100 for a lousy small fast food meal and a couple drinks and all I got in addition was a very bad attitude! I can get a bad attitude for free most places.",-1

Will use FLL instead given the opportunity.,-1

2018-09-26,0.2,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,disgusted at the level of service,False," I am disappointed and disgusted at the level of service at the Miami Airport. We arrived from Costa Rica a family of four, which we had booked our reservations as a family. We were told to stay together through the screening, through customs all the way, which we did. However, the chaos began as soon as we arrived at the Miami airport. My ticket was pre-check as we thought all four would be since they were all booked under my name as the lead person. We were instructed to go to the two different check-points. After being turned around twice, I informed the young lady that we had gone through this twice. If we had to come back, a manager is going to have to get involved. She instructed us to go back to checkpoint three because” the staff member there was new and didn’t know what she was telling us.” We went back, and sure enough, the staff member began to tell us to separate again. I told her what the previous employer had said to us, she pulled up our ticket on her phone and told us to go ahead. I couldn’t believe the level disconnect of communication here in the United States; there is a lot to be learned from Liberia Airport. Courtesy and politeness from the employees for starters. We finally arrived at our gate for departure. As we sat there trying to listen for the changes of gates. The intercom system is not the best; one could barely hear the changes. We saw so many travelers missing their flight and upset, as they should have been. The announcement should have been clear, and anyone on that flight name should have been called before that plane departed. I felt bad for those that were unable to hear the message in the mist of all the chaos. I’m sure that with all the upgrades in technology the intercom system can be much better, employee interaction should be superior. Staff should act as if they want to assist you and not as if they owe you something, remember we are “paying” travelers whether by awards or by credit cards we have paid for service and should be treated with politeness, respect, and clear communication.",-1

",False,"  Twice disappointed with the service at the transportation center. I understand that the staff may want to be friendly but they appear to be selectively friendly. I was trying to make a train; the person at the kiosk was having a leisurely chat and had no time to help me with my questions. He misinformed me, pointing me to the ticket machine and stating that I first had to purchase a ticked on the level where he was. Even after I had the ticket he still was talking and giving his opinions on some subject and did not stop talking to assist. The area was not crowded, but I had to figure things out myself. When I got down to the tracks there were ticket machines I could have bought a ticket. But by the time I had traipsed my luggage down the stairs (no mention or direction regarding an elevator) the train had departed. It being a Sunday afternoon I had to wait another hour. A week earlier, I had to wait for more than 5 minutes while the kiosk person spoke to another traveler about where he grew up and the schools he went to. Like I say, friendly—I get it—but isn’t the job one of helping travelers get from one place to another?",1
2018-08-29,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,they must pay $5 USD,False,  It is sad to see that for arriving International passengers they must pay $5 USD if they need an airport baggage cart. That's quite expensive and foreigners may not have American money to pay besides being alot of money for a cart. International arriving passengers may have alot of luggage they need to claim and transfer after a long flight. I have not seen having to pay for a luggage cart in most International destinations. It's a sad comment to welcome them to the land of the free and the home of the brave.,-1

2018-07-31,0.7,Couple Leisure,4,4,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,All staff were polite,True," Flew into MIA on September 26 from Madrid and out on October 2, going back, both legs on Iberia. Despite of what is being said compared to other airports, Miami worked quite all right for us. On arrival there were some works and had to walk longer than necessary, but went through immigration and an acceptable speed. All staff were polite. At arrivals got the chance to buy a US sim card. Waiting for hotel shuttle was tiring after a long flight, as there was not enough seating there. Also, TSA at MIA is much faster than at Orlando airport. Most importantly, arriving from Orlando on American Airlines and having to pick up luggage, as we didn't have a through ticket, and having to check in for Iberia was not bad! We just had to walk straight on from the AA part of the airport to that of Iberia. No need for elevators, or shuttles! Spanish-speaking staff are polite and courteous and do make an effort to help out. Overall, we have a positive impression of Miami!",1
2018-07-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,Poor organization,False, Poor organization of the planes and gates. Our incoming flight had trouble having a free gate to arrive at.

2018-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,it was a shambles,False,"  Probably the worst airport experience I've ever had. I was only there for a connection as I was travelling from MBJ- MIA then back to the UK. Customs in the UK is so simple and quite quick considering. The staff were so rude at customs in particular at security, they ignored you pretending they were speaking on the radio and couldn't hear. When we had to get our ESTA tickets it was a shambles as we had to do everything in 1.5 hours in time for the connecting flight. Instead of managing the queues one particular staff member kept shouting at me because I was using a different kiosk from my dad, which makes no sense because those questions were long so if there is a kiosk next to him it makes sense to use that - as I did on my way here 5 days ago. Other people were using more than one kiosk but she spent her time focusing on me instead of organising the queue. She kept shouting saying 'Mam Mam Mam' you can't use the kiosk, despite telling her 2 times our connecting flight was soon. The guy at customs was so rude, I'm sure that if you are travelling with a family member you're supposed to go up with them? But, we got yelled at and only my dad was allowed to go, I eventually went up and then a few seconds the customs guy called up another man who was after me - assuming he was my dad, I had to tell him we were not travelling together. In addition, we had to rush through security bear in mind by this point we only had 25 minutes left until we boarded the plane. My dad tried to ask one of the security women a question and she just pretended that she was listening to her radio and that it was so important, she didn't even acknowledge my dad. We kept telling them we were boarding in 25 minutes and no-one cared. Also when they give out blue cards when you go through security - the ones that determine whether you take your shoes off or not/take out your laptop. I just wanted to double check if I needed one as my dad got one and a few people before him did and she just shouted to 'go in that line'. Surprisingly we made the flight, and it was delayed by 45 minutes due to the manifest being typed up incorrectly.",-1
2018-07-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,signs were not straightforward,False,"  I've never been to a more confusing airport in my life. The signs were not straightforward. On our boarding pass, it said Terminal CE, but none of its signs stated that, it will state Concourse and a list of letters that did not make any sense to us, which was not helpful at all. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours because the captain was unable to arrive at the Miami airport due to the weather in Tampa, which is completely reasonable. However, the situation could've been handled much better. The people that worked outside the gate were unhelpful. They pretty much expected everyone to have smart phones and therefore were negligent in giving us, customers, regular updates as to when our flight will arrive. They only updated people who stood waiting in line for 15 minutes, instead of just efficiently announcing it to the general public, not that their updates were helpful to the individuals that stood in line because they kept pushing it to every hour, so it was very hard for customers to plan accordingly. By giving us an incorrect ETA, we were not able to decide whether to rebook to another flight or not. If we had known that the flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours, we would've gotten on a different flight. But the people at the gate kept ensuring us that it would only be an hour delayed, and then another hour if we asked again and again. This misinformation is unacceptable. In addition, the airport was freezing. I had to wait in line for 30 minutes at the Service Center for blankets to be told there were no clean blankets. I would check in with them a few more times and was told there were still no clean blankets available, during this 5 hours waiting period, this huge international airport did not think to provide blankets. So not only was my flight delayed, I caught a fever due to waiting at the cold airport for 5 hours, and had to call out of work the next day.",-1
2018-07-07,0.9,Solo Leisure,5,5,,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,well staffed at every turn,False," Dealing with a late international arrival, my connection was on time and I really had to hustle! Signage was confusing for getting to baggage, collecting it, navigating customs, rechecking bag and then security finally! It was around 6am and MIA was well staffed at every turn and due to crowds and rushing I overlooked my laptop and ipad after scanning all my carry on stuff. I was down the hallway running to flight when they caught me and delivered those! Thanks Miami TSA!",1

Not sure why these “lightning delays” only happen at MIA and not FTL or other South Florida area airports. Flight arrived at 8:30, it’s now 10:30 and still waiting on bag. Best to not check in bag for MIA arrival, or fly through other airport. You would think whoever runs the place would find the way to do better.",-1
2018-06-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,experience here was horrific,True,"  This airport is the most unorganized establishment, and my experience here was horrific. Security check in terminal D was where I needed to be at. Without explanation, I was asked to go to Checkpoint E. Get to checkpoint E, asked to go to F (10 min walk). Get to F, go through security, walk 10 min to just come back to see the original security checkpoint area I was supposed to go through! Absolutely unacceptable. Working for a city, my self, I am appalled at this airports lack of customer service. You want to attract tourists, get your airport crew on the same page, talk about customer service to be a number one priority!

Terminal employees cut in line and held the line up at check points. All Bathrooms are nasty, staff members have the worst attitude and lack professionalism. Restaurant was fully staffed but no one was “working”. Obviously there was a full bar and no one knew how to make a Mojito. Hope I don’t have to move through Miami soon.",-1

I refer specifically to the bathroom that is next to checkpoint # 3 (American Airline). It's the dirtiest bathroom I've seen since I live in USA. I hope this serves to improve the hygiene conditions of it.  Es una pena,que un Aeropuerto tan bonito y concurrido ,tenga los baños de mujeres tan malolientes y sucios.Me refiero especificamente al baño que esta al lado del punto de control#3 (American Airline).

2018-06-04,0.6,Business,2,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,"clean and easy to navigate""
",False,"  The airport is clean and easy to navigate, you don't have to walk miles between gates. There are not so many restaurants as one might expect, but there is a sufficient variety of dining options. Arrivals: Passport control lines are long, but that is the case in most places. The ""fastrack"" option or using an automated machine and then passing a receipt to the officer actually takes longer because you have to take 5 minutes to use the machine and then join the back of the queue of people who didn't use it. As always the staff shout at you like they are herding cattle. Departures: Check-in is simple and well signposted, queues are short as there are a lot of desks. Security takes a while, the priority line is not much shorter than the main lines. As with most Americans the staff are very rude and unpleasant. One of them pointed at me and shouted ""shoes"" whilst another shook his head and announced to the waiting line ""we shouldn't have to tell y'all the obvious"". It transpired this obnoxious exchange was in fact their attempt to ask me to remove my footwear and place it in the scanning machine, something I would say about 30 percent of airports require, so to me not obvious. But perhaps it was obvious to ""y'all"".",1
2018-06-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,,it is not a pleasant airport,False,"  Can MIA achieve any level of competence? I have long boycotted it and advised others to avoid for immigration purposes, and it is not a pleasant airport to negotiate in terms of TSA security. But I did opt to use for transiting between BA6578 (operated by AA) TPA-MIA and BA0208 MIA-LHR on 21 May. On paper, I had two hours for the transit. Flying time between TPA and MIA is just 37 minutes, but weather-related issues made for a TPA departure that was 20 minutes late. On landing at MIA, we then taxied to a halt that lasted 40-45 minutes before a gate was found for us. Pax with tight connections grew anxious as we waited. The AA captain himself lost patience with the false promises of any early move to a gate. A rush to connecting gates and disgustingly dirty bathrooms ensued when we finally deplaned. BA0208 was just starting to board when I finally reached my gate. This was located in a subterranean area of stygian gloom, the waiting customers looking like lost souls, doubtless with their own negative opinions of MIA.",-1

Overall I have to say our experience at the airport was fair. It was hard to find the luggage claim area after we landed and it seems like most people there spoke Spanish. One good thing I have to say is we used www.parkon.com/mia for our airport parking reservations. Great ROI. I like that MIA is expanding and upgrading it's features.",1

",True," We went on a trip to Orlando and because we couldn't find a fair price for a flight we opted to fly out of Miami. We arrived at midnight so not much to be said about that. Arrival and luggage was ok as was the transportation to the rental cars. On the way back home however, we 'experienced' this airport. The security lines were horrible. Everyone walks around at an immensly slow speed. One person can't be bothered with helping out others. No real info on who needs to go through regular detection gates and who needs to be bodyscanned. Our carry ons were taken apart after being scanned and it took one single security officer about half an hour before he went through our stuff to check. I don't mind that my carry ons need extra screening for whatever reason but please, do it at a decent speed. The security lines were chaotic at best. Once through security I can't say the airport was dirty but the amenities were very limited as was the seating. Once home I also noticed that the TSA cut the security belt around my suitcase open with bolt cutters, even when it had a TSA lock. And they must have had a key since the suitcase as well had a security TSA lock which was correctly opened. I also put a special cloth sleeve around my suitcase to protect it from wear and scratches which I didn't even bother putting back on. When waiting, there is free WiFi but only for 45 minutes. Great when WiFi was a novelty but nowadays simply incomprehensible. Miami Airport is truly on my to-avoid-list of airports now. I guess when visiting Orlando and the airfare is to expensive, you are even better off flying to Atlanta and drive to Orlando.",-1

Took nearly 2 hours to get through immigration and then we had to run through airport and push to the front of security in order to make our connecting flight (which we had already allowed a 2 hours layover for!). The staff couldn't understand what they were doing, we were queuing into an area where we had to get ESTA receipts and then 45 mins later another load of planes arrive and get guided into a similar area which is inexplicably not being used, with the result that people who had arrived 45 mins after us got through immigration quicker due to poor poor queue management. Cannot understand why those on connecting flights need to do the immigration process, transferring in the UK doesn't require this and it seems really unnecessary when you aren't even leaving the airport.",-1

As an American citizen, I can say that the Miami Internationals airport customs was the worst we experienced after visiting at least 8 other countries in Southeast Asia. Why is there not a separate line for Americans? Every other country does this. Why do I have to wait 2 hours in line so that someone can approve my customs information in 2 minutes! I pay taxes and the salaries of custom officials - foreigners don’t - so make it easy for your own citizens to pass through. How hard is that to understand. Every other country we visited understand that. But, that’s US government for you.",1

",True," From the moment we got off the plane every single employee we encountered in customs and immigration were disrespectful, rude and even down right mean. One gentleman’s job was specifically to tell people which line to filter into and yet he managed to sound extremely annoyed with every human being he came in contact with. The line was painfully long in immigration especially for the non-citizens and when I tried to ask a question to one employee she interrupted me mid question to tell me to keep walking. She treated the next two people who approached her in this same manner. The two women trying to organize the line did it by yelling and talking in bossy, annoyed tones to the hundreds of innocent people who were all just trying to do what they said. When someone made a mistake, heaven forbid if you didn’t exactly understand what “go to the end” means when the room is the size of a football field, then that poor person was berated by the employee who then walked away shaking her head as if every human was an idiot. After our first two negative interactions I started talking to my kids about how we should treat people. They could see how the employees we treating everyone and they could tell that we were just trying to obey whatever “rules” were in place to avoid being singled out. Unfortunately we saw employees act like school yard bullies well over a dozen times and didn’t see one kind exchange in the entire 2 hours that we spent in the Miami airport. Chaotic and horrible.",-1

If this is our “front door” to the world, I am embarrassed to imagine what overseas travelers must think. I have cleared customs in many other countries and they all put their best foot forward. Not so in Miami. Entire process took over two hours, airport is dirty and worms out, and never once did anyone try to assist with ensuring the process was understood. Then that had only one screening line open to get to your transfer and no TSA pre-check, so that took 45 minutes itself. We barely made our connection and had nearly a 3 hour layover! Embarrassing!",-1

The employees were just shouting directions, which were unclear and confusing. I witnessed not 1 but 2 different employees talking down to people - one of which was a man who did not speak English. They were shouting at everyone to “keep moving, don’t stop.” At the security point they told us to keep our shoes on and don’t take anything out of our carry on bags to get us through the line faster. In my opinion this jeopardises the security of everyone there for the sake of speediness. The employees were rude and the entire process of catching my conncecting flight was chaotic.",-1

The waiting time in the lines are however ridiculously long. The airport has obviously not been adapted to its increase number of customers. Waiting time going was at least 1 and a half hours. On the way back definitely shorter (30 to 45 minutes which is adequate) however at the expense of the politeness of staff. The immigration and security officers are extremely rude and obnoxious - amongst the worst I've experienced not only in the U.S.. How ironic to have staff shout ""computers ain't gonna take themselves out of bags"" and ""dont you have a flight to catch"" standing right next to a display saying that employees need to be patient and nice to travelers. Not everyone is a frequent flyer and most aren't familiar with airport procedures. The airport is clean however (toilets, floors and transportation) and the wifi works perfectly",-1

When we were at the wrong entrance we were again yelled at loud enough for everyone to hear. We got an ice cream at Haagen Daz and were ignored as the two workers chit chatted while we stood there waiting. Then there were paper liners on the inside of the cone. I went into the ladies room and the cleaning woman proceeded to yell at me as I apparently went to the side she was still cleaning on and pointed at me telling me “you! You use this side only!” A little courtesy and pleasantness goes a long way when you deal with the public. I will never use this trashy, obnoxious hole again.",-1

On the way back packed into a very small room, poor lighting, no investment to make the process slicker and no management. When the screening machine stopped working our line was told to cut into the other two lines.

Common sense we wouldn't have got that far without showing our passports in Antigua. Then to run to make the final boarding call for our connecting flight. What in the world is wrong with paying a few extra people to work in immigration. Also, it's always nice to return to your own country and get treated like a herd of cattle.",-1
2018-03-03,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no redeeming features whatsoever,True," Dreadful, every part of it, from the TSA onwards. The departure lounge is particularly disgusting. Whilst I sat amongst the bottles and desbris on the floor, an attendant emptied the bins and strolled away. No shops or bars except a perfunctory “hut” and an awful cafe “Marseilles”. Bags of rubbish and no staff, it could be the worst in the world. I’ve been flying and traveling for 45 years and was shocked at how bad Miami is. I can’t believe that Americans put up with such standards. I can’t accurately give rating or stars There is no shopping no bars, no restraints, no redeeming features whatsoever.",-1
2018-03-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,2,,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,worst service I have ever encountered,True," I can say with certainty, even by notoriously bad US airport standards, Miami airport was the worst service I have ever encountered. Signage was useless. Every member of staff I had the displeasure of meeting was hostile to the point of aggression. Information and directions were barked at travelers in an unclear and impatient manner, only for the next member of staff to bark contradicting information leading to the utter bewilderment of passengers. Although there was a large number of staff everything was chaotic and disorganised. A particular low-light of the experience was, when going through security, being told to take my shoes off, (even though I had been told to keep them on moments earlier) and place them directly on the rollers to be scanned. Predictably, seconds later the laces got stuck in the rollers. As I tried to untangle them a member of staff (rather than help) shouted at me repeatedly ""Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!"". When I explained the laces were tangled he offered no help or apology for his unnecessarily aggressive behavior. But rather stood idly watching the queue grow behind me. I have traveled through 50+ airports, and from the confrontational, incompetent and belligerent service I received, Miami is clearly ranked bottom of the pile.",-1
2018-03-01,0.4,Solo Leisure,2,3,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,I hope to avoid Miami altogether,False,"  When I arrived I was excited to see electronic passport controls. However, my passage was not so straightforward because I was not given clearance by the machine. My own fault, I had forgotten to include my middle name on my ESTA application. My friend who regularly transits through Miami says that electronic clearance may or may not help you beat the queues. I eventually reached the head of the queue and was then told to join another queue! I overheard two airport staff mocking a customer who didn't realise that she no longer needed to complete a paper landing form. Well, maybe the customer hasn't flown into the U.S. for a few years? Not a crime is it? Two ladies in the queue behind were appealing to staff because they had 1hr to clear immigration and check in for onward flight but the staff member just sneered at the customer and walked off. Waiting at the yellow line, I could see inside one of the booths where there was a male officer rocking on his chair, staring into space, ignoring the line. Rather strange behaviour. I suppose being an imigration officer must be a difficult job but I have not seen such an unfriendly bunch anywhere and I have been through Boston, New York, Washington, San Fran and Fort Lauderdale. If you are looking for something to eat at Miami airport be prepared for fast food. Next year I hope to avoid Miami altogether and travel via Panama.",-1
2018-03-01,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,very disappointed,False, Spanish speaking only heard. One employee said she did not speak English when I asked for directions. Lots of fratinizing in Spanish instead of waiting on customers that were lined up. Two very disinterested information persons who acted bothered that I needed information about my flight. I am very disappointed to find such insolence and entitlement.,-1
2018-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,airport staff were surly and rude,True," My recent experience at Miami airport when my husband and I were in transit from St Kitts to Toronto was very unpleasant and bordered on being traumatic. We joined the line to have our passports verified on the computers and were given a pass with an X on it. Therefore we had to join another very long line and have our documents verified by an agent. There was a very high volume of passengers and we felt like cattle being herded through, a term which has been used in several other reviews. While waiting, several very burly, tough looking men in uniform passed us by. It was like being in a police state. The agent who received us after a long wait in line was fine, however this was sadly an exception. Many of the airport staff we encountered were surly and rude and could not have cared less about customer service. The fact that they represent their country to a large number of travelers from around the world every day seemed to be irrelevant to them. When we went downstairs to the luggage claim area in order to go to our gate, there were a large number of more tough, burly looking men in uniform watching everyone as they were herded though the area which was intimidating to say the least. When we passed through security, one of the female security staff bawled at me in a loud voice which was totally unnecessary. I have never been spoken to in this manner in my entire life. In addition to the staff, the airport is poorly laid out and signage is confusing. We will avoid travelling via Miami airport in the future.",-1
2018-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,"rude, impatient and abrasive""
",False,"  What an outstanding example of American arrogance and rude behaviour this dump is. To the staff: seriously, you're the first Americans that foreign visitors encounter. Why not try to at least make a small effort at being polite and friendly? The impression you give travellers is that America is filled with angry, unpleasant people - you're doing a huge disservice to your country. I witnessed a security guy being incredibly rude to the people in front of me, coming very close to actually yelling at them when all they did was turn right out of a doorway instead of left (and no signage to say otherwise). If you don't like people and have zero tolerance for other humans then stay away from a customer-facing job. Almost every staff member was rude, impatient and abrasive, all of them shouting and bullying the airport visitors. There were a few exceptions who stood out. Even though he probably sees a million people in a week, he was polite and told us to have a nice day and it made all the difference. Also, the passport guy we had was professional and friendly. It put me off ever going near America again, for a holiday or to pass through.",-1
2018-02-23,0.5,Solo Leisure,4,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,a shocking entrance to the US,False,"  An ok airport but a shocking entrance to the US. This airport has more staff than customers, it’s amazing how many people are employed here. Let’s talk about oddities, first thing you see when arriving in country, an immigration machine where you get a reciept to foto immigration. There are 2 huge English grammar mistakes on this, really that’s your first impression? Then there is an announcement on level 3 about “moving walks” they are called escalators in every country! Why make up child like words? 99% of the staff here are Spanish speaking which I like, but I could see how someone without Spanish may struggle. Doesn’t help I counted 3 different dialects/versions of Spanish translated on signs, confusing! Once they work out which way to face on the moving walk, seriously? Forget immigration checks, should of had IQ checks.",-1
2018-02-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,we would have not made it,False,"  Came in from Panama to Term E and our connecting flight was at D1. We had over 2 hrs to make it and if I was not able to flag down one of the golf carts, we would have not made it. Going through security and customs and getting our luggage and checking it again took a lot of time. The worst was how far it was from E10, then through security, custom, etc and the long walk It must have been 2 miles long. I will never book a flight that comes from another country to this airport.",-1
2018-02-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Chaos reigns,False,"  I'm not at all surprised to read other reviews about rude staff, bad experiences and passengers being treated like prisoners or cattle at Miami airport. Chaos reigns, and is presided over by employees who make it blatantly obvious that they hate their jobs. When we transited via Miami in January and February 2018, a handful of the staff really stood out for their competence and pleasant attitude, but they were the exception, the other 90% were miserable, surly, disinterested and in some cases quite unbelievably rude. Procedures and systems seem ridiculously slow and inefficient, and passengers have to stand in long queues multiple times as they are inhumanely processed. The layout of the airport doesn't help, signage is poor and in any case you're directed to ignore the few potentially useful signs by stressed employees whose job is apparently to stand underneath them yelling the same thing at people all day long. No wonder they're grumpy. Overall, not a positive experience at all. Anyone who arrives here is made to feel very unwelcome indeed. Come on, Miami, there has to be a better way - just look at almost any other airport.",-1
2018-02-16,0.3,Couple Leisure,4,5,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,One of the worst airports in the US,False,"  One of the worst airports in the US. This is solely based on layout and design. The long walk between various gates in the E concourse is unparalleled. Why not a moving floor? Why not a team that connects the entire airport, not just D concourse. The many years of construction have only produced “lipstick on a pig”. Unfortunately I need to go through there now since that is the only place you can fly from on American to St Thomas. Charlotte is a much better AA hub.",-1

2018-02-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,rude and incompetent,True," This is by far the worst airport experience I have ever had. A customs officer was extremely rude to my wife, I and others in the group that had to go through an extra layer of scrutiny because they didn’t have the capability to check standard immigration paperwork in the standard line. The rest of the officers were rude too and treated us like prisioners. Simply unbelievable. Process took 3 hours and we missed our connecting flight. AA was gracious enough to get us on a following flight the next day but didn’t provide any type of hotel vochure, so I had to pay $125 out of pocket. Airport staff I dealt with were also rude and incompetent, with one individual advising wrong directions on two occasions. I’ll avoid the Miami airport in the future.",-1

This meant applying then attending an ""interview"" in the USA on my last trip. This was the best $100 I have ever spent. I literally walked from the plane to an empty trusted traveller machine (there were long queues at the other ones), then straight through immigration. The entire process took seconds, compared to the usual hour long wait or more. I bypassed literally thousands of people waiting to be seen. Highly recommended.",-1

Concourse E is awful. 3 tiny F&B area, that's incredible. Tiny duty free shop, unbelievable. At least do a common use lounge that people can have access to even if they are not flying business (priority card, or pay a fee at the entrance). Wifi didn't work. Very limited number of plugs for electrical equipment.",-1
2018-01-11,0.6,Business,2,3,,3.0,0.0,,,3.0,"no big queues at immigration"" ",True," Arrived around 3 pm afternoon. Surprisingly no big queues at immigration. It would take me only 15 mins if they would not ""invite"" me for a secondary interview, but thats another story. My colleague at least made it fast. Unfortunately she still waited at the luggage belt after I processed my secondary interview, one hour after landing. Perfect timing for me as just at this moment our suitcases arrived. We proceed to rental car centre, no possibility to smoke somewhere after a long flight. We need to walk around 15 mins to a people mover on a fluffy carpet which is not so easy when towing a suitcase. The people mover then took us in 5 minutes to the rental car center. Overall average experience, especially as the long waiting time for luggage sucks.",-1
2017-12-19,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,3,,3.0,0.0,,,,hellishly long security lines,False,"  
Arrived from Frankfurt at 2.40 pm after flying business class. Got to the customs and noticed ridiculosly long lines. I looked for some type of separation by class or nationality and nothing, everybody was lumped together. There were at least 500 people in that large room, all lined up line cattle to the slaughter. Really, don’t American citizens deserve an easier entry into their own country? After waiting patiently in line for 3/4 hr, got to a passport machine where my passport was read and got a receipt with an X on it, I guess they could not believe I had nothing to declare, hence I was placed into another line where a real agent would re review my entry. Waited another 15 minutes and while waiting I noticed that most agent run kiosks were assigned to X passengers. Well if this the case, why bother with the machines, they cost money and they are useless. Finally, the agent called me and he seemed very nice, talkative and accomodating. He was sure to ask me if I had anything to declare which I responded: ‘maybe a cold’. Overall uneventful but why the bureacracy, can we not do better? One thing is for sure, if I can skip Miami airport, I will be more than happy to do so. I forgot to mention the hellishly long security lines when I left 1 week prior, what a total joke.",-1

",True," I found this to be the worst airport I have used in recent years. It was cold - a chill that hit one as soon as one passed through the entrance doors. The check-in area was dirty, it was difficult to find information about amenities while waiting for check-in to open and a number of staff were quite abrupt and unhelpful when asked for help. Eating facilities were limited. It was a great relief when Virgin check in opened where the staff were courteous and helpful and we were able to move through to the more comfortable departure area.",-1

Check in was chaotic busy and slow moving. Equally security screening was long and slow with some of the most miserable employees I’ve seen in any airport, prepared to be shouted at and treated less than human. Once you have survived the chaos of check in and security prepare to find yourself in a cold sterile airport environment with little facilities for eating drinking and relaxing in. Not sure who they got to design this airport but they need sacking!",-1
2017-11-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,the worst airport ever,False,"  This has to be the worst airport ever. Security a joke, very loud and strict rules shouted out by half interested staff and yet a person in front carried a 1ltr bottle of water through unchecked! Departure gates F10 - F23 dirty, smelly and very tired. Duty free is pathetically small and staff pounce as soon as you enter.",-1
2017-11-20,0.2,Business,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,there is a serious motivational problem,True," I was surprised at how disorganized the Airport was. The advertised free wifi was not available, the security crew was extremely rude literally hearding the passenngers thru the checks calling out things like “pay attention”, “stay focused” etc. It reminded me very much of my military drill. I have not experienced such behavior at any other US airport where TSA is usually very efficient but polite enough at the same time to make passengers comfortable. While waithing at the Business line for the security check at least three wide-body aircraft crews (= min 75 to 80 crew) were bypassed and led thru the business checks (on most other airports I have seen dedicated crew security lanes). When it was finally my turn I was redirected to the economy lane and had to wait again. At the x-ray machine there were no bins and when I dared to point this out to the TSA staffI was rebuked with “didn't you hear me!? I already called this out twice! bins are on their way”. The entire process took over 45 minutes. After the security check, the food court service staff was pleasant but the janitors and cleaning crew were very unattentive with litter piling up on many tables. Once they did come around they cleared tables even while patrons were still eating their food. Tables were not wiped and felt very sticky obviously not having been cleaned for some time. It seems to me that there is a serious motivational problem with a large number of employees at MIA that I have not witnessed on the many other US airports that I arrive to or leave from.",-1
2017-11-18,0.1,Business,3,5,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,,No escalators. No signs,False,"  One would think that walking from gate D8 to D36 would not be that far. I learned later that it is a mile from one end to the other of concourse D, a long walk for some of us. The problem was that we had no idea that there was a Skytrain we could have ridden. Unfortunately, there were no signs or any indication that there was any option other than walking. I finally asked an employee about an alternate, and was informed that the green columns in the middle of the hallways had elevators to Skytrain. No escalators. No signs. And of course there were very few passengers, since most travelers may not have even known about it. I was shocked that an airport with as much business as Miami was so poorly labeled.",-1

Have just been through security check for departure. Have never experienced such amateur operatives. Didn’t bother to give clear instructions on what was expected, eg: where to stand, what was going to happen. Spent time chatting to each other. Would nearly all benefit from being reminded on how to be polite and courteous to travellers. Our arrival at MIA 2 weeks ago was completely differently, courteous and efficient staff.",-1
2017-10-25,0.5,Couple Leisure,4,3,,3.0,0.0,,2.0,3.0,better than it used to be,False,"  Miami - London Heathrow, Thursday 19 October: Despite the many bad reviews this airport, in our experience, has improved greatly since the car rental centre was moved virtually on site with a short connecting shuttle train service. No more catching those awful shuttle busses with all your luggage. Also the electronic immigration machines have sped up the previously awful queueing time upon arrival. This time we flew back to the UK with Virgin Atlantic: driving in with the aid of SatNav and the very few road signs we got to the car rental hub without any issues. Put the luggage into a storage facility until we could check in with Virgin - we were a bit early so first in the queue - and got through security after about 1/2 hour. Travelling Upper Class so found the Lounge and did not bother with the many, many fast food outlets, sports bars or coffee places. The big downside of Miami Airport has always been the crowded concourses and very poor signage - only seems marginally better now. The WiFi was also slow. But all things considered the airport is better than it used to be. Tip: If you don't have access to a lounge or have a few hours to kill there is an open air cafe/bar on the top floor of the Hotel that we used to go to. It also connects to an indoor bar with sports screens and air - con. I believe you can pay to use the Health Club and use the pool as well, and the view over the runways is spectacular.",1

Getting your passport stamp takes a long long time, they only have one person working and the guy took ten minutes for each passenger. I almost didn't make my connection to Atlanta due to slow and unorganized airport. After you get your passport stamped you will have to get your lugguage and drop it to your transfers which most airport do. It you have to get out the terminal again and go through security to get to your connection and that took a long time also because they only have one working scanner.

This is by far the worst airport on the planet when you travel internationally. From arrival to immigration they're just way behind the curve and never seem to care. At least 50% of the time upon arriving the airplane has to sit on the tarmac waiting for a gate to open. This messes with peoples' connections and plans. The immigration system is run by a bunch of morons. The officers are just fine, but the employees directing you and the way in which it is all arranged is just mind-boggling.

We were held in long snaking queues for three hours until we missed our connecting flight. Staff were unhelpful and intimidating, not answering any questions, just barking orders. After missing our flight we had to spend the night there in the freezing airconditioning with no instructions or help as to what we could do or where to go.

No transit facility (meaning travelers passing through the US mingle with domestic travelers). Gate to Carousel is usually at least half a mile distance. (Gate 48 to Carosel 26). The last 8 flights from LGA to MIA have arrived with no gate available (over capacity). Signs say Baggage Claim both ways (left and right - one way uses the train, one way by foot - why not write 'Baggage Claim - Via Train) when you leave the aircraft. Credit Card and Sunpass lanes to exit parking are regularly broken. Greed and disorganization rule. I've used airports in every continent and this ranks in the worst 3. AA lounge dates to about 1992.

Unanswerable questions I guess. I have never had worse food at an airport than when I reluctantly buy food here, so I do it as seldom as possible. Seats in the terminal must be 30 years old, ripped. Tons of shops, whick is a plus for some, but I'm not interested in paying a premium price for anything so to me shopping is not very useful. In a word: awful.

We had to queue for more than 2.5 hours. The agent was on his mobile sending and receiving texts while checking our passports. I don't think workers should be allowed to use mobile phones while at work. On our way back the security staff were extremely impolite, talking to passengers in a very rude manner.

Poor mobility between terminals plus a new complaint. The hike from American Airlines baggage area to terminal J is still a lomg walk. No trams or walkways, zero! Poor planning. Internet service in the most advanced airports is now free but not in Miami. When will this airport join the rest of the world's leading airports?

My flight arrived at 5pm and I was back at airside 35 min later. Immigration was fast which took about 10-15 min and walked through customs as bags had cheked through with ITI-tags.

Perfect. This time it was a disaster. All passengers were directed through the automatic passport / fingerprint / photo machines. There were reasonable queues, but all fine. Normally one then takes the printed strip through the ""quick"" channel, it gets glanced at and you are in. However, this time, every single foreign visitor had to pass through the full immigration check - and there were only a handful of immigration officers present - literally 5 or 6. This meant queues of literally 2 plus hours minimum. I was one off the first off the plane and it took me two hours ten minutes. Others will have waited for 3+ hours It was shambolic and awful.

This place looks so dingy and old, it was like stepping back in time! I travel worldwide and it was one of the worst airports I have seen. Flew Iberia out of the E wing. Once you go past security there is very little in the way of food options or shops. It consisted of Pizza Hut, a small beer place, and two freestanding snack stands. That was it. When I got out to the actual gate, there was nothing. There were a few ""stores"" but they weren't open and I don't know if they are even functional. It was for a 5.30pm flight which ended up being delayed. There were bathrooms, and seating, but nothing else. Everything was closed up. There were 4 different gates where I was. There was a business class lounge not too far for Iberia business passengers, or American Airlines. At this area they did have a duty free shop which was small. The waiting area was fairly clean and the seats were comfortable enough. You have 30 minutes of free wifi after that you have to pay for it. I was early for my flight so the line to go through security and waiting to check in were not long. I had to take a short train to get out to the gates. This airport is serious need of an overhaul. It looks like the 1960's. The buses are in one area on the lower level. Depends on the airline you fly which terminal you are out of.",-1
2017-01-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,everything is disorganized,False,"  Both today and our arrival two weeks ago were horrible experiences in this airport. It is poorly laid out. It is old. It is slow. Everything is disorganized. Having to change planes and go back through security is asinine. Absolutely nobody at any point in time was kind or helpful from American Airlines to security to asking for help from airport staff. Not one person said hello or even cracked a smile. Upon landing in Tampa, we had the exact opposite experience which just reinforced just how bad Miami is. I will do everything I can to never return!",-1
2016-12-24,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,4,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,everything moved pretty quickly,False,"  I have only ever connected through Miami, so I can't speak to check in, etc. But our connections have always been on international flights, so we have gone through customs and immigration. We have gone through early morning (6:30 am), so my experience may not be typical, but we had no issues. Everything moved pretty quickly. We actually had a 7 hour layover (thanks, American Airlines!) so we had plenty of time to wander and not be rushed. Overall, I think the signage was good, and the one staff member we asked a question was polite and gave us good directions. We ate at the Irish pub in the American Airlines section of the terminal. The food was good and reasonably priced for an airport restaurant. I know many people have had bad experiences at this airport, but ours was pretty positive.",1
2016-12-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,endless lines and frustration,False," Miami is an awful airport. Anytime I travel through it something goes wrong. Endless lines and frustration for travelers. So dirty, seats are the least comfortable and do not allow lying down. Food and shopping options are not attractive at all and on top of everything, WiFi is not even available for more than 30mins. Avoid if you have the option.",-1
2016-12-13,0.7,Couple Leisure,4,3,,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,deplaning to jumping into a taxi took us about 30 minutes,False,"  I transited MIA on my way to St Maarten and arrived and departed on my way back to London. My first arrival was at 4pm from an international flight. The queue for APC machines was very long and a staff member directed us to the immigration desks, the queues here also looked horrendous, a helpful staff member asked if anyone had connections which said yes and she gave us a fast track orange voucher which enabled us jump the queue (our connection time was 2 hours). We had only carry ons so had no bags to collect, but had to go through security again, which was slow considering the queues were not long. From deplaning to clearing immigration and security took about an hour thanks to fast track voucher. As we were traveling business class we went to to business lounge rather than use any of the dining outlets. We arrived at MIA again a few days later. Our arrival time was 7pm and immigration was much quieter, the APC machines had no queue, but was so badly organised we opted to use the immigration desks instead and we were seen to very quickly. From deplaning to jumping into a taxi took us about 30 minutes.",1

2016-08-28,0.1,Business,1,3,2.0,3.0,0.0,,1.0,2.0,queues everywhere,False," Miami is a truly awful airport. Queues everywhere just to get to another queue. After 1 hour being aimlessly shuffled along, they finally opened more auto passport machines, which then proceeded to give at least half of trackers a big 'X' on their dockets, which meant another 45 mins to have photo and fingerprints dive again, thus time manually. I have arrived into the US at Orlando, JFK, La Guardia, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, LA, Seattle, Vegas and Miami is by far the worst experience I have had. Totally incompetent management and processes. Avoid if at all possible.",-1

We barely made the flight, even though we had 2+ hours in this airport. The signage is pathetic - completely unhelpful. Staff are just as bad. They had us in one line, then pulled us to direct us to another, then back again and that was just to check our bags. We were Pre-TSA, but we were herded halfway down the airport to the second check-in line, which moved so slowly that we should have stayed in the regular line closer to our gate.",-1
