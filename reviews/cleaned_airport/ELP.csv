2022-08-25,0.9,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,the best airport to be stranded in,False,"  My flights were delayed for many hours due to weather in Dallas. El Paso airport is the best airport to be stranded in! It has an easily-accessed smoking area in a lovely courtyard. It's small enough to get around quickly, but big enough to have decent food. My delays would have been much worse in a larger airport, but El Paso airport made my delays manageable. Staff were also great. Security and the like (especially outside directing vehicle traffic) were nice and helpful, offering extra help or information if I needed it. Love this airport! The only minor annoyance was that it did not have a lot of charging ports in the seating areas, so I had to stand while my phone was charging.",1
