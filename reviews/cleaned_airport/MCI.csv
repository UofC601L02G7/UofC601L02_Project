2024-09-14,0.2,Business,3,4,3.0,4.0,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,better than what it was before,False,"  The airport has been updated and it’s much better than what it was before, but still doesn’t even have a business lounge or place to go to if your flight is delayed and every time I fly through MCI, the ladies’ bathroom in the Terminal always has a very long line, because the other option is the ALL Gender bathroom, but a lot of women don’t feel comfortable sharing a bathroom with men.",-1
2024-04-21,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,2,4.0,5.0,3,3.0,5.0,5.0,like the size and style of the facility,False,"   Southwest 4 hour layover on a return trip from Cancun. Airport is quite nice and modern. With enough space to accommodate surges. I'll take this airport any day over an Atlanta Delta layover. Clearly a new addition to the Kansas field (did not experience old terminal). Customs/bag claim, re-check, and re-screen for TSA for the domestic leg was super quick. Really like the glass jetways. Friendly TSA and gate agents. Bag claim and TSA were all quite clean. Gate areas were dirty - and not in the post-rush kind of way. Heavy duty cleaning seemed neglected/deferred. One example that stuck out: Dusty and fingerprints on window area/sills, etc. Bathroom sink areas could have received more attention. Some soap dispensers not functioning. A small gripe: Impossible to get a bottled unsweet tea anywhere in the facility. Every retail business had the exact same drinks in their grab and go coolers. My guess is it is contracted out to Pepsico or something. What's the point of having multiple retail businesses if they all serve the same stuff? Overall, I really like the size and style of the facility. Will look forward to my next layover here, should the time come.",1
2023-12-09,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,4.0,3,,4.0,3.0,“What were they thinking” ,True, Getting from drop off to your gate takes forever. After you check in with airline they have you walk a country mile to get to security. Than its another country mike to get to your gate which was Delta but God help you if you took Southwest. The old airport was fast and easy. What were they thinking. Poorly designed.,-1
2023-12-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,1,3.0,3.0,2,,,2.0,"dirty floors, dusty everything",True,"  The bathrooms look like they haven’t been cleaned in weeks. Splatters on the back of the toilets, dirty floors, dusty everything. Looks like all they do is refill toilet paper and seat covers",-1
2023-11-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The worst airport ever"" ",False,   I have waited for about 1.5 hours to enter the gate. It was so disappointed and I haven’t experienced it before in any airport. The worst airport ever.,-1
2023-11-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,0,,,,Little to no signage for anything,True,"  The old airport was great. Fast TSA, comfortable gate seating, no frills. The new one - not even close. Check in was very clunky, there's no real traffic flow, just a mass of passengers. Horrible, slow TSA (similar to Atlanta). Way too many shops and restaurants. Little to no signage for anything. The gate seating area only sat 55 passengers. More shops and restaurants, why are there any at all? An airport is not a destination, it's a thoroughfare. I attempted to find a bathroom and looked until I saw a sign flat on the door (no hanging sign). Overall a poor experience with something that was supposed to make life better. Next time I'll fly out of St Louis.",-1
2023-07-12,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,4,1.0,1.0,4,4.0,4.0,2.0,some important things missing,False,  The new airport is very pretty but there are some important things missing. The signage is not great. They must have forgotten about signs for baggage claim because they only have sandwich boards in the main terminal area directing you to the baggage claim. We found NO SIGNS for rental car area. Finally got a broadcast on the PA regarding car rental location and shuttle. The TSA lines were very long even though not many people are here. They had the area roped of as if they were expecting a large crowd and didn't bother to shorten the lanes when not needed causing people to walk more than necessary. The new seats are uncomfortable. Our TSA person at the baggage check area was rude and didn't seem to know the rules for people over 75. I realize it is a work in progress but seems like some of these issues should have been obvious to the designers and planners. Lets hope it gets better as time goes by.,1
2023-07-06,0.7,Family Leisure,4,2,4.0,4.0,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,modern necessities one would expect,False,"  Feedback on my initial visit to MCI (new terminal). I am a Kansas City native --- this review is critical, as it should be. Overall impression is outstanding compared to the 1970s era terminals. It addresses the needs of a 21st century Midwest airport with all the modern necessities one would expect as a flying customer. First impression walking in, it's big. It spans wide and the design incorporating natural lighting with an abundance of windows is refreshing. The evening sunlight streaming in through different angles really provides a ""non-restricted"" feel as you walk about the terminal. The respective airline check-in counter/placements are easy to identify and span the width of the front end of the terminal for easy access. Security access is fairly streamlined and the entire process is able to accommodate large volumes of travelers (non-TSA airport - VMD corp) more natural light as you progress through each arm of the terminal (A/B/C) with interior lighting not overbearing. The walkways are wide and allow for excellent views of the tarmac, exterior gates, and various angles of the entirety of the taxiways and runways. Additionally, the escalators and walking escalators are positioned nicely and push you through terminal in a speedy manner. More shops, etc. at each terminal branch, providing basically anything the traveler would need. The vibe and local venues are all a welcome addition and definitely fulfill the needs of the traveler. Individual gates and structured well and offer comfortable seating and ample wireless device charging. The one thing that seems odd is the placement of the gate flight monitor(s). It is essentially in the seating area of the individual gates. Why not place it directly behind/above the agent booth/desk for easy and quick access and explanation (poor design decision). Boarding the plane, the traveler is treated to long glass jet bridges that allow for excellent views of adjacent aircraft and outside weather conditions. This is a well thought out design that many major airports do not offer. Overall, the new MCI/KCI terminal is a massive upgrade to the Kansas City area. It has the opportunity for expansion and I would expect future modifications to address design shortfalls and customer feedback. We concluded it feels like a mall when walking though the new terminal. Three things need immediate addressing - (1) Men's restroom upkeep and sanitary conditions unacceptable. Need to revisit the options of installing automatic hand blower machines and look at the cleaning schedules to ensure conditions do not deteriorate to the point of being an embarrassment.  Cleaning crews need to maintain a regular schedule on vacuuming the terminal carpet - paper and debris everywhere.  Please explain how the gate flight monitors are controlled by the city? How is this beneficial to the traveler or airline staff? Local control to change/modify the monitors shouldn't even be a discussion. This new terminal is supposed to represent the pride of Kansas City aviation.",1
2023-05-18,0.7,Business,3,2,5.0,3.0,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,housekeeping services are poor,False,"  Brand new airport that looks pretty nice but housekeeping services are poor in and outside the airport. They tried to make it local Kansas City restaurants only so don’t look for a Starbucks, you won’t find one. Seating at gates is sufficient with work table space as well.",1
2023-05-11,0.1,Business,5,5,5.0,1.0,0,,5.0,,Poor lighting for road signs,False," Poor lighting for road signs for rental car return. By the grace of God I was not killed, I was going head on to incoming traffic the wrong way because of poor lighting, it was 4 am on May 11 2023. Lack of signs and direction for rental car return. Please fix this problem before someone is hurt.",-1
2023-04-05,0.4,Business,3,4,3.0,3.0,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,Very inconvenient airport,True," Brand new, pretty and nice but very inconvenient. They did not provide enough space to check is thus creating chaos. Confusing lines, no one was helping. For departing passengers using parking shuttle you get down on arrival area then get to upper level to ticketing, only 1 escalator going up and down. If not working you have to carry your check in luggage. very high escalator, did not see option for stairs and minimal number of elevators. Once you check-in getting to your terminal is a long walk not enough moving walkway. Beautiful but not functional, poorly planned new airport. Spent money to make it beautiful but poorly functional. Very inconvenient airport. If I don’t live in Kansas City, will surely avoid this airport.",-1
2023-02-11,0.1,Business,3,1,2.0,1.0,0,,,1.0,by far the worst I've been in,False,"  I fly 20-30 trips per year and KC Airport is by far the worst I've been in. We almost missed our transfer flight because doorways exiting terminals were not adequately marked so we had to go through TSA again. Another lady said she had the same experience. TSA people took my reusable water bottle because it was full of water from last airport and would only let me leave airport and pour out. Before all this happened, I went to the restroom, which was shockingly filthy, broken doors, non working towel dispensers, half smashed toilet paper dispensers.",-1
2022-09-23,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,Terrible customer space,True, Terrible customer space and internet as compared to other cities. No room to sit or eat when your flight is delayed or cancelled. Taking the shuttle back and forth to the rental car is awful. Let’s no get started with the internet and cell phone coverage in this concrete jungle. Tell your customers to move.,-1
2022-08-06,0.2,Business,5,3,3.0,3.0,1,1.0,,1.0,this is not an airport where I want to return,True,"  Arriving in Kansas City wasn't too bad, but departing was awful. The airport is broken into a lot of little areas for gates, and of course you can only go behind security in the one serving your airline. It seemed like all of the pre-security restaurants were closed, and in the Delta area there was only one post-security sit down restaurant, which charged an obscene amount of money even by airport standards. The airport itself is poorly lit, with a lot of broken stairs and escalators, and just gave off a depressing vibe. The only good thing is that security was very fast. But overall, this is not an airport where I want to return.",-1
2022-08-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,completely appalled by MCI,False,"  I use to live in KC several years. Just flew in tonight and completely appalled by MCI. Yes it has always been small, very outdated and practically no where to eat and shop but tonight when I got off plane about 10.15, it stunk beyond words. Trash was piled high, it smelt like bathroom was clogged up and people were trying to find seating wherever they could. The smell literally made me physically sick to my stomach once I got outside. For someone seeing this as first impression of a beautiful city it missed the mark big time. Come on KC it’s time to take some pride in your airport.",-1
2022-07-25,0.1,Business,2,1,1.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,This has got to be one of the worst airports,False,"  This has got to be one of the worst airports I have ever been to and believe me I have traveled extensively. From the rude, loud, and verbally abusive TSA agents, the antiquated equipment, slow processing of bags and personnel, and just down right lack of up to date knowledge, this is your first interaction with the Terminal and sets a horrible tone. Then lets move onto the facilities or complete lack thereof. Restrooms are dirty and never maintained or stocked and you have to be skinny, traveling with no bags, and have a lack of smell to even get into and use one if you can find it. Choices for food or drink are limited, outlandishly overpriced (more than other airports), and if you do get anything its stale. Their locations in the dungeon you have to stay at until you board your plane give light to the complete lack of forethought by whomever designed this. Now you need a seat to wait for your plane. That too is horrendous, toxic experience with never enough, and the one I did find to sit in today at SW Gate 43, was sticky and there was a smell coming from the area around me. Decided to stand for the last hour until boarding. I will need to detox everything from my bags to myself before I step foot into my home. Not to mention complete detail my vehicle afterwards. Add to that there are not places to recharge your electronics at your seats like all other airports for your long stay in the cold, dark lifeless tunnels of a terminal unless you crowd around a small area with 1 or 2 outlets, like cows waiting on the evening trough meal. I see they have started a new terminal, but of course the designer there too was either stoned, blind, or has no architectural class whatsoever. And whom ever approved this so called improvement must have pockets lined with gold. You build a beautiful new terminal and then tower a gaudy concrete parking structure in front of it to hide what little majestic magic you were trying to show off. I was once proud to say KC was my home, but if this is the best foot forward you can show to our many visitors, returning Missourians, or International Flyers, then you should be removed. There are two pieces of sunlight that do exist in this total train wreck of an airport. (1) The rental car facility and staff still remain top notch. Whether spending big bucks or trying to save a few I have always be treated with grace, humility, and kindness on the buses, counters, and car parking lots. (2) Gate agents for SW and Delta (only two airlines I use) are always friendly and eager to help in anyway. Kansas City Airport (MCI) you need to seriously look over your customer service, facilities, and architectural managers and make a complete overhaul. Unless this is the look your are going for, draining the customers of all money, life, and happiness at which case you have nailed it.",-1
2022-07-15,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,,2.0,the most poorly organized and dirty airport I have ever been in,False,"  This is without a doubt the most poorly organized and dirty airport I have ever been in. Here is a recap of my Kansas City Airport adventure. As the bus from the rental area drops you off at terminal C (American) door C10, you enter the building and can see overhead placards to the left and to the right both listing ticketing and gates. As my flight indicated C84 I headed towards the ticketing to the right. I dragged my bags nearly 1/4 mile around the curved building edge which obstructs your ability to see any distance beyond a hundred feet or so. After 8-9 minutes of walking I stopped dumfounded as the ticketing area that was revealed around the corner was Spirit and Delta. Not American Airlines. I completed an about face and walked all the way back to the C10 door. I double checked my ticket, double checked the sign and sure enough gate c84 was in fact the direction I headed. With no other choice I went the opposite direction and found the American Airlines ticketing center approx 150 yards in the opposite direction of my gate. Needless to say I shared my experience with 3 AA employees one of which was a supervisor. There is old used toilet paper on the ground right inside the terminal as you pass security. The restrooms haven't been cleaned in forever as is evident by the horrible urine stench, puddles of urine on the floor near the urinals, crusted urine stains on the toilets, the garbage is overfilled and used paper towels are spilled over onto the floor. As you walk through the terminal there is garbage on the ground, horribly stained carpet, food debris on most seats and literally piles of what appears to be mud/manure on the floor where someone had scraped their boots in the ground. Pretty sure I found the true origin of Covid. Yup in KCI.",-1
2022-07-14,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,3,3.0,4.0,0,,,4.0,A giant step backward,False,"  I don't go to an airport to eat, or shop, or admire the furnishings. I go to catch a flight. Period. For people who live in the area, you can currently arrive at economy parking half an hour before your flight boards, take the shuttle to your gate, check in (with or without bags) and still easily make your flight. I have been doing this since 911 slowed things down. The city has embarked on a multi billion dollar new terminal ""upgrade"" to make our beloved airport a clone of larger markets. Long TSA lines, long treks to the gates (now it is about a 2 minute walk from check in to TSA). Separate TSA checkpoints at each cluster of gates means you get through in 5 minutes or so.), We are not a true hub. We don't want a hub. We have plenty of flights and the airlines compete for our business, resulting in lower airfares. The city stopped routine maintenance to strengthen their case for a new terminal. Had they done due diligence, the airport would have looked just fine. But the construction unions held sway and the travelling public here will now be paying increased ticket prices, laden with extra fees to pay for this. A giant step backward.",1
2022-06-04,0.3,Family Leisure,4,1,1.0,5.0,1,,,4.0,this is the dirtiest airport I have ever been in,False,"  I have traveled world wide and this is the dirtiest airport I have ever been in. The carpet, bathrooms and seating are all unkempt. I understand it may be an older airport, that is not the issue. It needs cleaning. The airport is easy to access and get around. Gate attendants were polite.",-1
2021-12-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,1,1.0,4.0,1.0,"rude, obnoxious and angry at Passengers",True," TSA was extremely rude, obnoxious and angry at Passengers. They order people around and throw their personal items like they are Nazi's at a Concentration Camp. This ""Agency"" should be disbanded. They are a useless waste of my hard earned money that I pay to these rude morons to do nothing but harass citizens.",-1
2021-11-09,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,2.0,1.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,Where do these people come from,True,"  The TSA Agents were absolutely awful and down right ugly. There is absolutely no reason to treat any person they way the lady treated my son and I at the initial check in. She was wearing ""2"" masks and I could not hear a word she said and my 17 year old son could not understand a word she said either. We are not frequent travelers and this was our fist time at this airport and the lady should have been fired. She was ugly to every person I heard her dealing with. She yelled at all the line telling us there was a ""glare"" in her little box so we need to stand in a certain spot so she could see our face. Just wrong all the way around and customer service was zero, then we go to the line where you take off your shoes and go through that machine. Where do these people come from. I cannot believe TSA thinks it is fine to speak to people the way they do. It is down right awful.",-1
2021-10-15,0.1,Business,3,2,1.0,4.0,1,,1.0,3.0,the worst airport I have been in and I travel weekly,False,"  This is without a doubt the worst airport I have been in and I travel weekly. There is nothing here but chairs (with no outlets to charge electronics), seating is located next to security so it is noisy with bins and alarms, no lounges or restaurants just a fast food grab and go thing (Delta gates). People are crammed in like sardines in a can. This place is very old and has not been updated in decades from the look of it. If you have an option to fly into somewhere (anywhere) else you should take it!",-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Business,1,1,3.0,4.0,1,1.0,,1.0,bad for use of Economy Parking Lot,True,"  I understand MCI is undergoing construction but this airport has always been bad for use of Economy Parking Lot. Too few buses and one driver in particular is very rude. I refused to ride with her this morning, and she kept antagonizing me like she wanted to pick a fight. I waited 5 minutes for next bus and had a very pleasant ride. I have seen this bus driver act this way before so the airport must tolerate her behavior. This is just how Kansas City is, I guess.",-1
2021-06-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,Terrible place,False,"  Absolutely horrible place. They have signs for social distancing but pile people on top of each other. No soap, paper towels or functioning water faucet in the Ladies room. Filthy seats, nothing wiped down, food and garbage in seats. No maintenance people around and the airline ticket counter agents could care less. I will pay more to avoid a layover here next time. City of Kansas City you owe everyone who travels through here a big amends if we don't fall prey to the coronavirus here. Terrible place. Try to avoid especially if you have kids.",-1
2021-01-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,an embarrassment to the entire city,False,"  This airport is an embarrassment to the entire city. Inadequate equipment, incompetent staff, visually a joke. Worst airport I've seen in all my travels.",-1

2020-03-11,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,"horrible depressing place"" ",True," Filthy, nasty carpet, dirty, dark, drab building with unclear confusing signs that will lead you to where you don't want to go. Tattered seats. Small tight dirty bathrooms that can only accommodate 4 women at a time. I refused to eat here despite being hungry due to the filth. Seriously who designed and maintains this horrible depressing place? I hope to never fly through here again. They need to tear the whole airport down and start over again.",-1
2020-02-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,,3.0,worst airport for a layover,True,"  This is the worst airport for a layover in a developed country! Where to start with a list of what's wrong? First, instead of having access to the entire terminal building as all other airports, travelers are crammed into about 6 gate areas and you cannot leave it without going through security again to get back in. That means you are stuck with limited services unless you want to go through the TSA line again. And what great services are available! Small one-holer bathrooms with 1970s designs that are dirty and smell, too few to accommodate everyone which causes long lines even in the mensroom. Restaurants that close at 7PM when my connecting flight does not depart until 8:25pm. Not enough chairs for everyone to sit. Ancient airline displays with plastic cards vs. modern terminals. I've been to third world countries with airports that are much better! I'll never layover here on a trip again. Southwest, you should be both ashamed & embarrassed that you call this airport a hub! I'll fly other airlines instead of flying through KC. You've lost my business.",-1
2019-12-29,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,this was my worst airport experience,False,"  The staff at this airport made the decision to not honor passengers with TSA precheck during a very busy holiday weekend. There was no communication indicating this was happening so we got into a very long security line with little time to spare. Then the TSA agent scanned and took both my luggage and backpack aside for an internal inspection of all contents. All of my luggage contents were removed then shoved back into my bags without any findings. Approximately 75% of all passenger bags were inspected without any findings. The security line was so confusing with bags being removed and belongings being removed that people were walking away and leaving their personal belongings at security. In a span of 5 minutes, 3 different TSA agents brought over laptops to the gate agent that people left behind. I also walked away without my laptop then quickly returned to retrieve it. The TSA agents were also very rude and not doing anything to resolve the long lines or chaotic situation! Once we got through the gate I was shocked to see how absolutely dirty the gate areas were, with trash on the ground everywhere and overflowing trash cans! We’ve traveled to this airport for many years and I’ve traveled to many airports in and outside of the US and this was my worst airport experience and I will never return.",-1
2019-12-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,5,5.0,5.0,0,,,1.0,a poor reflection of her position,True," I have always had pleasant experiences with the Kansas City airport until I was leaving the airport in my Uber. My Uber driver was cussed out by an older woman who was airport security with quite explicit language for trying to merge into the exiting lane. There were no signs and she was not directing traffic, but rather sitting in her car blocking the lane we were in. No biggie, due to us needing to scoot over into the left exiting lane. Just as we were merging, she jumped out of her car and began to profusely scream and swear, demanding we stop. She proceeded to allow every other car pass us and then walked to the back of my Uber drivers car to take his license. She did not come to the car nor give a ticket, so I am not quite sure why the explosive language and looking at the license plate. Her level of professionalism was pitiful and completely uncalled for. It was a poor reflection of her position. The rest of the experience at the Kansas City airport was super friendly and pleasant, as usual. My rating is solely based off of the explosive security woman. I reccomend this airport, but strongly believe someone should address the exiting lanes with class and clarity.",1
2019-12-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,,1.0,Staff are rude,False," Staff are rude, car rental staff are even worse, no help loading our baby or luggage from shuttle to airport, and forced to cross dangerous roads in the process. One disgusting, uncleaned restroom for the women serving no less than 8 gates and a restaurant. They can't tear this place down fast enough. Flying into Tulsa from now on.",-1
2019-08-15,0.1,Business,3,2,1.0,3.0,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,Worst airport ever,False, Worst airport ever. You are dropped out by ticketing then ensues an hour plus of hell. You check in then walk what feels like a mile to security entrance then retrace your steps inside secured area for another mile to get to the gate to find out you are trapped with no restrooms or amenities. Everyone waiting was moaning about the setup.,-1
2019-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,This place should be demolished,False,  This place should be demolished at the earliest opportunity. Kansas City should be embarrassed to have this representing the city. All of the awful things people have said on this site about this Airport are true. I have a two hour layover here and I am counting the minutes until I can get out of this wretched place.,-1
2019-02-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,2.0,1,2.0,,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience,False,"  I am in a lot of airports and always find Kansas City security to be rude, disrespectful, humiliating. They will paw through your personal belongings and dump them all over the counter. Absolutely horrible experience.",-1
2018-12-17,0.1,Business,1,2,3.0,1.0,2,,,1.0,This is the peak of stupidity,False,"  Arrival was no big deal. I left this morning. Walked through security. Was randomly selected as usual, then once allowed through I discovered that the gates don't connect. So I had to leave, go through security once again, where I was randomly selected, once again, the ladies ahead of me had to deal with the same thing and were annoyed. The workers there couldn't answer any of the questions they or anyone else had. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the day before, and the part that made me furious is that they threw out my toothpaste saying it wasn't allowed since they don't let you take in liquids over a certain amount, but one of the gate TSA people let a pilot carrying four cups of Starbucks coffee through the security door without hesitation. This is the peak of stupidity. All this about how they're making things safe for us when everyone knows the TSA is staffed by people who wouldn't make it at McDonalds.",-1
2018-12-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Dark, dismal, no conveniences",False,"  What an embarrassment to Kansas City. Dark, dismal, no conveniences. The old state pen in Jefferson City is more inviting. Kansas City is a beautiful city with plenty to offer, but this gulag of an airport sure doesn’t reflect that. Step up your game, MCI.",-1
2018-07-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,Bathrooms are filthy,False,"  The grossest airport I’ve ever been to. Bathrooms are filthy, food selection is poor, there’s probably half as much seating as there needs to be. I wanted to hold my breath the whole time I was there. I would legitimately consider routing my travel to a different airport next time. Additionally, upon my arrival, they could not locate my bag. Not necessarily MCI’s fault, but could have been handled better.",-1
2018-06-20,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,3.0,1,1.0,2.0,3.0,an absolutely wretched airport,True, This is an absolutely wretched airport. Design is a nightmare. Food is worse than the convention center downtown - and that’s saying something. I ordered breakfast and it was honestly a pre-made/pre-cooked plastic-tray goopy mess. Bathrooms are wholly inadequate — and poorly serviced. Pre-packaged food in gate waiting area picked over and poor quality. Gate areas sardine-can crowded. I remember being in NYC’s Port Authority bus terminal in the late 1970s — this was worse. The city is lovely. The airport is a deterrent to wanting to ever come back to the city.,-1
2018-05-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,,,1.0,worst airport for a lay-over,True," The worst airport for a lay-over I've ever been in! Limited bathroom facilities, dirty, small area to wait, a necessary trip outside of security if you want to look for gifts or food beyond a Pizza Hut and kiosks. An upstairs eatery and bar with no restrooms. I'll never layover here on a trip again. I'll change my destination before I'd go through this airport again. I've been to 3rd world and developing countries' airports with cleaner more available facilities!",-1
2018-05-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,home town airport is disgraceful,False,"  My home town airport is disgraceful! My first complaint is that my family member and I were separated going through security. As of last Dec. 2017, they now send TSA Pre to a totally different gate for security check. Huh? When I asked one of the agents to explain, he was nasty and said it was easier for employees. I mentioned I didn’t like it. Oddly enough a few minutes later I was patted down for my Apple Watch and a nylon zipper on my pant leg pocket. What? I’ve worn the same pants through security before-no issues. My son was not patted down for his Apple Watch. The bathrooms at the gates are terrible. No soap or paper towels-gross. MCI-do something!",-1
2018-01-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,4,1.0,4.0,0,,,1.0,basic customer service ignored,True," Arrived 2 hrs early in frigid temps with a carry on. People checking bags at SW lined up outside! After killing time for 30 min I happily moved to a side line so Seattle passengers only would get routed through the slow security check. It feels good to cooperate. Finally 30 min later Seattle customers done and all in line are feeling good. Our line was split in 2 and those who had been waiting the longest were in the TSA pre check, which I paid to have too. Then I watched as not only was our line ignored as the pre check, but also as the customers who had been waiting in line the longest. The agent who had asked us all to move aside, suddenly was making no eye contact and didn't say a word to the agents checking our tickets. I'm tired of being polite and helpful and then basic customer service ignored. People in line longest are next customer served.",-1
2017-11-21,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,need to carry out huge changes,False,"  I am surprised this airport has one star. Not sure where to start, small, get full even with a small number of passengers. It smells and the worst part is? There is only one bathroom in the entire 50s gates area, don't know which line is longer, the TSA security or the bathroom lines. Officials need to carry out huge changes to this airport. Look at the picture I added for bathroom line.",-1
2017-10-09,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,2.0,1,1.0,2.0,3.0,Long overdue for replacement,False,"  Long overdue for replacement. If you have carry-on only, you can skip the long lines at the ticket counter in hopes of getting into the security line sooner. TSA Pre only recently became an option for AA travelers, and the newly renovated gate area for AA now links all their gates, but it still suffers the same problems that Southwest’s gate area in B does - lack of seating, no clear and direct paths between gates, sparse charging ports (and finding one that actually works is even harder). Food options airside are minimal and horribly overpriced, usually consisting of day-old factory made sandwiches, wilted salads, and $8 bottles of juice.",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst major airport in America,False," If you like having zero options for food (or paying $10 for a cold and stale sandwich), having to go through security to use the bathroom, and being in extremely close proximity to people going through security checks as you connect to your next flight, Kansas City Airport is the place for you. This is easily the worst major airport I've ever been to. There are only two restaurants, and both somehow seemed like 1 and 1A for the title of ""Saddest Place on Earth"". When your best food option is a microwaved sandwich from Starbucks, you know you're in a whole new level of suck. Also, for some odd reason, half of the airport is walled off and is inaccessible to the general populous. Why? Good question. This isn't Westeros. I have heard from locals that the airport provides easy in and out access, which could possibly be true. But the fact that this place hasn't been updated since the 70's is incredible, and the shocking lack of restaurants and cleanly bathrooms make Kansas City International seem like the worst major airport in America.",-1
2017-06-22,0.3,Family Leisure,3,3,1.0,3.0,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,gate seating area is inadequate,False,"  I'm sitting in the B gates area now waiting out a 3 hour weather delay. The women's restroom for all B gates only has 3 stalls. There was no soap, paper towels, or toilet paper. Southwest has put in charging stations, but the actual airport offers few, if any. To get to nicer food or restroom options, be prepared to leave security and be re screened in order to get to your flight. The gate seating area is inadequate for a full flight of passengers. Be prepared to camp out on the floor.",-1
2017-05-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,3.0,0,,,4.0,transfer procedure totally outdated and unacceptable,False," I arrived American Eagle terminal C at Kansas City Airport, and had a departure connection with Alaska Airlines (SkyWest) terminal B. I had to exit the airport, take a shuttle bus and go back through TSA security. The airport was crowded and very confusing. I travel a minimum of 4 times a year and at age 77 I am quite capable of getting around with ease and understand directions. All airport employees, bus drivers, and airline agents were very friendly and helpful in a difficult situation as I had a short connection time. Once I arrived at terminal B, I immediately went to the Alaska Airline customer counter. The agent printed up a new boarding pass with TSA pre-check printed and marked with yellow highlighter. The agent then escorted myself and several others to the TSA check point, and explained to the TSA agent that the plane was in boarding process. The TSA check line was backed up. The agent explained they were not equipped for TSA Precheck and we would go through the routine boarding process. I followed instructions removing my CPAP machine from the original case, before placing it on the screening belt. Removed my shoes, and proceeded through the screen machine. I set it off and explained I was wearing suspenders, I was told to go back, another agent came up saw my suspenders, and politely explained to her co-worker I was wearing suspenders. I was told to go back through the screen machine, of course I set it off again. After lifting my shirt and showing the agent once again the suspenders the agent said put your shirt down (I was wearing a t-shirt under the suspenders) so no skin was showing. Another agent than began the long process of explaining the pat down all the while the plane was boarding. The agent commenced with the pat down process. His pat down was humiliating. Once I boarded the plane several passangers remarked ""they sure gave you tough time"". The work load on TSA would be greatly reduced if MCI Airport could make it so it is not necessary to go through security when changing terminals from one airline to another. The current transfer procedure is totally outdated and unacceptable.",-1
2017-05-14,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,1,1.0,3.0,,departure gates are crowded and noisy,False,"  This airport reminded me of other woefully inadequate facilities like LaGuardia. The circular terminal building was never meant to have the secure area splitting the length of the entire concourse. Travelers in transit have to exit the sterile area for the larger bathrooms and better food choices. The departure gates are crowded and noisy. This place is awful, and I'll avoid connections here in the future.",-1
2017-03-13,0.3,Business,4,2,1.0,4.0,2,2.0,4.0,4.0,my hometown airport has deteriorated,False,  I am a Kansas City resident who travels frequently for my job so am very familiar with other airports around the country. I am appalled at how far my hometown airport has deteriorated. The bathrooms are despicable! Filthy and in disrepair every single time I travel which is 2 to 3 times per month. The food choices are sparse and extremely expensive as compared to other airports. It's time KC woke up and does something about the airport.,-1
2017-03-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,2,,,2.0,this place is awful,False,"  This place is awful. I feel as though I am in a cattle yard. Having to go through security just to use the restroom is ridiculous. Talk about deterring people from flying. 1 bathroom ""inside"" the wall to service passengers is bogus. I will never fly through this aiport again. Avoid this place, even if it means paying more for a non-stop ticket. Lesson learned.",-1

There is TSA prechecked, other reviews said none, at the Delta gates for 56-60 and there was a longer queue there than I have seen at any other airport. There is very little after the security except a bottle of water less than a liter for more than $5 and I could not find any water fountain. Small and narrow in a rainbow shape. Even the check in for Sky priority was slower than everyone else.",-1
