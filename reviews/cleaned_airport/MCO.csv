2024-09-09,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,needs to improve the quality,False,  Leaving travelers sitting in the tarmac for over an hour when there is no weather on site after a cross country flight is not acceptable. We can see the weather now rolling on meaning this hour will be extended further escalating aggravation onboard. The airline was quick to clear us as landed in their system to give the facade of a timely travel experience but that is a complete fabrication of the truth. MCO needs to improve the quality of the experience for a city that is supposed to be welcoming of its travelers.,-1
2024-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“I loathe this place”,False," Why is MCO getting worse with each passing week? As a frequent flyer, out of all three terminals, across several carriers, this airport is pathetic. Between the sheer lack of on site parking, the lack of employees that speak English and unimaginably poor ground service, I loathe this place. I will do anything I can to avoid checking a bag because I know I am in for a minimum of a 30 minute wait at baggage claim. That’s on a good day. The wait for a gate to taxi to, the wait for a jet way brought to the plane, then the incredible, inevitable wait at baggage. Carry on only isn’t always an option for me. As one waits, the announcements are made at times only in Spanish, but when they do make it in English, usually secondary to the Spanish, it’s incomprehensible. Listen at any baggage claim, you’ll hear passengers complaining about them. After a ridiculous wait, when you finally get your bag, it’s smash to bits. Every.Single.Time. Of every airport I travel, world wide, my home airport, MCO, is a disaster.",-1
2024-05-16,0.1,Family Leisure,3,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,TSA women are horrible,False,"   The TSA women are horrible with no manners. They should be saying “thank you for visiting, come back again”. Instead they tell me this is not Universal this is Orlando International Airport when I’m going through the scanner. They speak harshly to some and are nice to some. Second time departing Orlando and they tell me I have something between my legs. They told me either they feel me all over in front of everyone or they take me to a room to strip down. Mind you I’m traveling with a small child. They really need to learn courtesy and be more polite. Is this how they are being trained? This is the Jet Blue TSA ; one had gray hair and the other had red short hair. They picked up my sun screen in my carryon but not the big Fuji bottle in my son’s bag smh. So much for checking and security!",-1
2024-05-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,does not have enough parking spaces,False,"   My wife arrived on Flight AD8706 arrived 6PM sharp and my wife only left the luggage's/immigration at 7:50. Between the airplane get the finger, luggage available, it took 1 hour and 40 minutes. Immigration was quick. Also the terminal does not have enough parking spaces for it's current operations. This was the third time parking A and C where closed and I had to park elsewhere. Luckily I learned how to park at train station and walked 20 minutes to airport C, avoiding a 30 minutes walking from B parking to C.",-1
2024-05-08,0.4,Business,3,3,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Very far behind the times,True,"  This airport has a extremely large number of visitors. Ground transport and flow to and from are fine. Concessions facilities and restaurants are far and few between 1 sit down bar restaurant for many gates waiting lines everywhere, all facilities both male and female have long lines. Very far behind the times, would rather fly to any other airport in they area.",-1
2024-04-16,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,3,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,continues to get worse and worse,False,"   I live in Orlando, so use this airport frequently. I don't know what is happening but it continues to get worse and worse. I flew internationally for holiday and returned last evening (April 15th). I left out of Terminal A and returned to Terminal C. I parked in North Lot. Apparently you can take a shuttle from C to the South Lot but not the North Lot. WHY? So I had to take a shuttle to Terminal A to then take another shuttle to my vehicle in North Lot. The shuttle took forever to arrive to C. I saw other shuttles (Mears, off site parking etc) circle two or three times while I waited for the shuttle to take me to A. When it did arrive, me and other other 3 passengers all informed him we were going to A, however he dropped us at Terminal B and told us that was his only stop. So I then had to drag my luggage across the airport to get to Terminal A to catch the next shuttle. That shuttle arrived slightly faster, however the driver didn't even get out of his seat to help any of the passengers board. He just sat there staring at us. A nice passenger helped me load my luggage onboard. I had asked a couple people in the airport how to get where i was going and one girl actually told me ""it wasn't her job to answer that question"". When I did get to my vehicle and went to pay and leave the attendant couldn't have been any more annoyed that I was trying to pay her. She barely could extend her arm to take my payment and seemed severely pissed off she had to actually perform a function. I traveled to three countries and therefore three airports and am sadly embarrassed how our city is represented with regard to our airport. After customs and retrieving my bags, it took me 2 hours to get to my vehicle last night which is horrible. Why is there no shuttle to North Lot from C? Why doesn't the shuttle that is supposed to take you to A not actually take you to A? Why are the workers so rude and unhelpful. Really poor on MCO's part.",-1
2024-03-28,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,Worst wheelchair assistance,False,"  Worst wheelchair assistance experience ever. Attendant assigned to me did not speak enough English to understand my needs, ended up parking me off to the side and walked away!",-1
2023-11-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1,5,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airport experience,False,"  This was the worst airport experience in my life. Very Rude People. Very Few Facilities.  The public announcements were a joke and they were being read like it a joke by a person who sounded about 10 years old. They kept repeating that people are not allowed to use phones in the terminal, and yet looking around guess what, everyone is on their phones because that's what travellers need to do! Being asked to pay $30 for a baggage trolley. (£1 in the UK). Massive queues for the immigration lanes - we waited for over 2 hours. This terminal is very badly designed. No opportunity to purchase any refreshments and no seats. There are no shops whatsoever in the airport on the way to the hire car. (we rented a villa so a shop would have been really handy) Outbound - Similar experience, very few shops and no opportunity to buy any duty free. Encountered extremely rude & cranky TSA operatives. I ended up getting angry myself at the way I was being shouted at and left my iPad/tablet behind. It would have been fine but the tray with this item ended up on a different conveyer belt and I didn't realise I'd left it behind until I was on the flight. To add insult to injury, MCO Lost and Found have said the only option to get my item returned will cost me $349 via UPS. This is an absolute joke as the UPS website quotes me a fraction of this price. The item itself is worth about $150. When you consider MCO auctions thousands of lost electrical items for profit (ggauctionsonline.net), this little operation seems to be lining somebody's pockets at MCO. I had high hopes for this visit but I never dreamt I'd end up being financially exploited by the richest country in the world.",-1
2023-10-29,0.1,Family Leisure,3,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,1.0,"staff and TSA were crotchety"" ",True,"   The airport staff and TSA were crotchety, not at all helpful with my disabled family member either. A lady stands at the family and disabled TSA line entrance and basically gate keeps it. We explained we had an autistic family member and she still tried to deny us access, she was so rude. Not at all up on the TSA cares policy in the least!  Do not recommend. Oh but don't worry they gave me a sunflower lanyard that no one paid any attention to.",-1
2023-09-25,0.9,Family Leisure,5,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,a big improvement on previous visits,True," Arrival and departure into the new Terminal C at MCO. I have to say it was terrific. Through immigration in 10 minutes and into a rental car 15 min after that. Departure was equally as good. No Queues at security and a good selection of Eating places, including Shake shack. We only had hand luggage which is important to state, but it was a big improvement on previous visits.",1
2023-09-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Shockingly poor from start to finish,True,"  Shockingly poor from start to finish. Could not disembark on arrival as ground crew had a problem with connecting equipment - about 30 minutes extra. Allegedly only ‘one belt’ was working for baggage - waited 2 hours with lack of seating, people lying on the floor etc waiting to get bags. We asked if our elderly parents could go through passport control and get a seat, while we waited for the luggage. We were told yes, this would be fine. Then when our parents attempted to do this they were spoke to in a demeaning tone and said they couldn’t do this. Totally understand that things can go wrong in any industry, but a timely, consistent and courteous approach are some of the best ways of dealing with problems and maintaining or improving customer relationships and experiences. Orlando Airport is the worst airport I have ever had to use.",-1
2023-09-18,0.1,Business,2,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,get some real seating please,True,"  I have unfortunately had to travel to or through MCO with some frequency over the years and it is always chaotic and the employees have no sense of urgency. To get through the line to have baggage checked by security can take very little time but the screening process takes forever if they have to pull your bags. It requires a supervisor who has led feet and all slow the process down and make things annoyingly tedious. There were 4 people in wheelchairs awaiting their baggage for almost a half hour while I and 4 others were also waiting for someone to expedite the process of opening and checking bags.  Service is slow all over, there is nowhere to sit and when you do find a seat it’s covered in crumbs, old turkey and goo from the 1980s. No where to charge your phone or get work done. Not business friendly whatsoever.  No retail spaces to pass the time. Folks sitting on the floors everywhere you look. The only pluses are that’s it’s usually cheap, car rental return is easy and the tram always seems pretty clean. Just get some real seating please.",-1
2023-08-15,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,a consistently poor experience,False,"  One of the worst tourist airports I have visited. Over two hours for baggage to be retrieved on arrival and then an incredibly slow departure from the airport as you pass through customs. On departure, only 2 out of 12 security lines open (in the middle of the day) which resulted in over an hour queue to exit. This is my third trip through Orlando airport in the last four months and it’s a consistently poor experience every time.",-1
2023-07-16,0.3,Couple Leisure,4,2,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,Very poor service,False," The TSA was very rude and did not treat people as customers. They were confused about what they wanted you to do, and then they started yelling at people. Very poor service!",-1
2023-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,no direct customer service number,False, This is the worst Airport ever! My son was scheduled to depart from there last night when his flight was delayed. Then they got on the next flight but it left the gate only to return back to the airport. They were told that they were going to have to board a different flight due to something with the plane. Only to find out that they wouldn't be able to board another flight departing until Saturday. The airline nor airport would accommodate them in no way. I have been calling since last night until current leaving messages and getting the run around. This was my son 1st experience on a plane to celebrate his birthday and look what happens. There's no direct customer service number for the airline which doesn't make sense.,-1
2023-06-14,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,Totally unacceptable service,False," Upon arrival at Orlando the Customs were excellent and very quick, our luggage arrived very promptly too - we opted to take our luggage on the mono-rail with us and were out of the airport within 45 minutes - excellent service all round. We also Departed on 11th May, the departure was awful, our Virgin Check-in was faultless, the Security was AWFUL, so long and disorganised, its been like this for the last 22 years and never gets any better, very long queues and half the security lanes closed - why! (the staff though are lovely). When we got to the area where we departed from all the food areas were closed (9pm), our flight did not leave until 10.20 - Outback Steak House could not seat us as they only had 1 member of staff working, it was the same for the other outlet. The Duty Free, which is the worst Duty Free I have ever seen, no stock at all also shut at 9pm! If you have flights going out with 100's of people of those flights you should have some outlets open to feed them, the lounges close at 9pm too. Totally unacceptable service.",1
2023-06-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,Restrooms outdated and small,False,  Restrooms outdated and small. Staff is slow and unwilling to help. Security lines can be up to a mile. Limited seating at the gates. Expect to walk a lot navigating terminals and the trams.,-1
2023-06-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,never experienced a new terminal as bad as this,False,  I have never experienced a new terminal as bad as this. You have to walk half a mile up hill to get to baggage claim after a long flight. I saw people stopped and hyperventilating. Then the wait for bags is absurdly long. I am not quite sure if they have more than a few people unloading planes. Then the border patrol guy gave me a lecture on how wonderful Florida is because you don’t pay income tax. I see what not paying income tax does to infrastructure. Then rechecking bags is confusing and unclear. Overall I give the new MCO a D minus.,-1
2023-05-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,2,,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,Marathon walk to bag claim,True,"  As a frequent flyer and Orlando area resident, I was flabbergasted by the impoverished appearance and user unfriendliness of this brand new terminal C. Plain, unadorned beige walls. Shockingly scuffed and marred floors. Crudely finished bathroom floor. Marathon walk to bag claim. It looked like a low bid renovation of a bus terminal. The huge ceiling height and skylights made me wonder about cooling costs. I felt bad for my fellow travelers, walking the long distances after a 10 hour flight, undistracted by color, design, or assistance. I appreciated the airport ambassador who directed us, and the courteous passport control folks. However, I am shocked by this building, and embarrassed for the image of Orlando that it gives to visitors to the City Beautiful.",-1
2023-05-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,new terminal is terrible,False," The new terminal in Orlando is terrible. Lines are long, service is lacking and rude, the building is very big and confusing. Took almost an hour to get our luggage and then we had to wait another 10+ minutes to get a walker (brought from somewhere else - it was on the same plane). Will not book any MCO flights in the future with any carrier in that terminal.",-1
2023-05-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,5,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,Wait times are insane,True, Wait times are insane. People arriving 2+ hours early were missing flights left and right because security lines were taking more than an hour and 15 minutes. We made our flight with 30 seconds to spare after SPRINTING through the airport.,-1
2023-05-16,0.4,Family Leisure,4,4,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,Our luggage took one hour to arrive,False,  We arrived at Orlando via Terminal C which is the terminal BA and Aer Lingus to name but two now use for their flights. On arrival we had to go upwards via a sloped incline to arrive at an upper level where a sign indicated how far it was to baggage reclaim (it stated an 8 minute walk). This is not at all accurate for families with small children or for anyone with any sort of mobility issue. There are no moving walkways of any kind or seating prior to arriving into the baggage reclaim area prior to entering immigration/passport control. Our luggage that day took one hour to arrive; this was due to inclement weather and problems with unloading the aircraft. Some of the TSA staff at departures could benefit from more training in customer relations. Airside area is clean and has a few shops and eating places in it prior to arrival at the gate area. Be prepared for a long walk to your flight if your gate for this is at the end of the corridor.,1
2023-05-13,0.2,Business,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,worst to spend any time in at all,False,"  Of all the airports, this is the worst to spend any time in at all. NO working outlets for charging phones or electronics. Restrooms for women require long waits and today was relatively clean, but in the past has not been good at all. Limited food vendors and few choices. I avoid this airport whenever possible and really wish it was traveler friendly. People sitting on the floor because there are not enough seats. Queue lines in the walkway that makes it difficult to move around.",-1
2023-05-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,3.0,absolute worst airport experience,False,"  Who designed this monstrosity? This is the absolute worst airport experience I've ever had, and the absolute worst at MCO. We arrived yesterday at Terminal C from a British Air 9-hour flight. We were met with an uphill incline (and we had baggage with us). We are in our 70s and had to stop several times to catch our breath. Besides the steep incline, this is very antiseptic looking. Once I regained my breathing, I thought to myself that if I were a first-time traveler to the United States, I'd want to turn around and go home. Took a long time to get baggage, but we were on a large plane. Our plane arrived early at 6:25 pm, and our ticket said 6:50 arrival. We had family coming to pick us up, and they had to keep circling around. We left Terminal C around 7:30 pm. Absolutely ridiculous. Worst news for me is that I'm scheduled to fly Icelandair in November, and I'll be dreading that arrival for the next several months. Invest a buck or two, people! Install some escalators!",-1
2023-04-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Orlando Airport customer review,True,"  
Everything from parking, lines at ticket counters, security, food kiosks and restaurants are all crowded and severely understaffed. You don’t have time to complete a purchase because the lines are long with usually one employee serving a very long line. Hyatt hotel is overpriced, air conditioning doesn’t work well. Rooms are humid despite being cooler. Sub par all the way around.",-1
2023-04-19,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst airport I have ever been to,True,  The worst airport I have ever been to. Over an hour now getting through security. Very close to missing my flight. Machines that I think were operating in the 80's. Understaffed but yet incompetent and uncaring security. This airport is/should be an embarrassment to the state of Florida,-1
2023-04-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,need to have professional training,False,"  Orlando MCO guest services need to have professional training, in the event when you have a delayed flight that turns into a canceled flight with customers who have been waiting on a flight from 5:40pm to 11:40pm with children involved it becomes a high stress environment for everyone, the fact that the staff where mocking customers laughing at customers and taking their frustrations out on customers that was just uncalled for uncomfortable.",-1
2023-03-01,0.3,Family Leisure,3,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,at 9:30 pm everything is closed,False,  Its 9:30 pm - our flight was delayed. Food stores are closed. The duty free is closed. This is an international airport - at 9:30 pm everything is closed and some Which are still open are closing at 10pm. So their food is all done. Travelling with my 80 year old Mom who is diabetic and can't find anything for her to eat.,-1
2023-02-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,extremely long walks,False," Where to start, from the extremely long walks, starting at security, the tiny bathrooms (only two stalls) lack of seating, limited food options. From last gate 230 to main hall where most the food is will take you 15-20 minutes to walk there. The upside down nature departures on lower levels, aerials on upper. Constant elevation changes. Don’t know why you would put carpet on the international walkways. Airports have been in operations for a century and designers still can’t figure them out. Oh and don’t forget the walk to train to walk if you are connecting to another airline plan 40 minutes at minimum. Waste of 2.8 billion if you ask me",-1
2023-02-08,0.4,Family Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,2.0,overly confined at this airport,False,  I felt overly confined at this airport on how you have to take a shuttle to get in and out of it. I brought carry on so as to keep the trip chaotic free and an attendant that was checking the bags through the device chose to take one of my bags further and took two containers away. One was a gel that was over 3.5 oz. The other was a solid sea salt scrub and he claimed it was a gel and did not look into the container to see the texture of it. You have the scrape the product out with a stick it is so stiff. If that couldn't go on the plane as a carry on why was my deodorant allowed? I feel It was a pure and easy theft. I don't think it's right for one attendant to have the only judgement in order to get away with taking anything they pleases like that.,-1
2023-02-02,0.5,Family Leisure,3,5,3.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,"issues that need to be addressed"" ",False,"  Although the expansion of Orlando airport is amazing, there are some issues that need to be addressed. Size of terminal, and lack of assisted transportation for those with disabilities. Coordination of rental car agencies. We arrived in terminal C and needed to find transportation back to terminal B. This took about an hour to finally get to our rental vehicle. Should have assigned or made it possible to pick up a car at terminal C. I understand that terminal C opened recently, logistics around the airport should have be planned as the terminal was being built. A lot seems to be after thoughts.",1
2023-01-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,Complete mess and utter chaos,True, Inconsiderate staff. Complete mess and utter chaos. Airport setup is confusing. No coordination whatsoever. Good luck finding your way around in this labyrinth. International flight and domestic flight were departing from the same terminal which made everyone miss their flight. Any sort of argument or pleading with the staff was futile.,-1
2023-01-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,bathrooms were marginal and unpleasant,True,"  Lines for checking in were understaffed so the lines were long and unpleasant. The lines for going through security were impossibly long. That area was clearly understaffed. The monitor claimed it would take 23-25 minutes, but it took us 45 minutes. The waiting area for Delta was filthy. The chairs were disgusting. Many of the chairs were actually broken. There were not enough places for people to sit. The food available was very substandard, and the selection was way too limited. The bathrooms were marginal and unpleasant. Often 2 or 3 announcements were blasting at the same time making it impossible to understands any of them.",-1
2023-01-05,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,5,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,Terminal C arrival is a nightmare,False,"  Terminal C arrival is a nightmare. After a 4 hour delay we arrived late, the walk from the gate to the baggage claim is long. Very difficult for even minor mobility issues. There were at least places to stop and rest along the way. It is a very long walk across multiple levels with no moving sidewalks or golf carts. It probably took me 1/2 hour to reach the baggage claim where I waited another hour for the bags. Decided to walk over to the car rental desk to find out where to get the car. Turns out you either have another long walk to take the tram to terminal B or you wait 30 mins for a bus. My flight landed at 10 and I got to my Disney Hotel at 2.00 am. Will be hard pressed to fly any airlines using Terminal C unless they make improvements.",-1
2023-01-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,Terminal C is horrible,False," Terminal C is horrible. Very poorly designed. The walk from the gate to baggage is so long with no people movers. I use a walker and I know that no one with any kind of mobility issues will be able to walk the half mile to baggage. To get to baggage also requires going up two levels. Yes there are elevators but the buttons are at the end of the bank of 3. I literally pushed the button 3x and the elevator opened and closed before I could reach it. The fourth time I ran and managed to jam my walker into the closing door to get it to open. Signage is also not very clear, but three of us finally figured out how to get to baggage. I was last off the plane, had to wait 10 min for my walker, took 20 min to walk at a decent pace to get to baggage, was directed to the wrong carousel and when I arrived at the correct carousel the bags still were not coming out. There were 5 stops before I finally got my bag over 30 minutes AFTER I reached baggage. From the time we reached the gate until I got my bag, was over 70 minutes! At the VERY LEAST this terminal needs people movers. If you have ANY mobility issues or are even a little out of shape count on 20 min to get to your gate you are almost forced to take a wheelchair even if you normally can navigate with a cane or walker. Terminal C is a nightmare. I hope they correct the problems before I fly Jetblue again. So poorly designed.",-1
2023-01-01,0.4,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,unfriendly and inconsiderate,False," Orlando airport terminal C has a steep walk of about 10 minutes upon arrival. This is not consumer friendly at all, particularly for older people like myself and my wife. They don’t have any alternative arrangement like escalator or elevator. This is really shameful! No other airport in the US or anywhere in the world is so unfriendly and inconsiderate to senior citizens like us.",-1
2022-12-21,0.3,Couple Leisure,5,5,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,Terminal C is not age friendly,False,  A brand new Terminal C. Once you have checked in and head towards security they have a coral. Now with 8 people already at security and a attendant or whatever they call her standing there. My husband who is 80 and suffers from Neurapathy and I am 70 suffers from arthritis we had to walk back and forth back and forth about 6 time. It did not occur to this person to lift the rope for us to go straight ahead as there was nobody else there. I could understand if there was a queue. This Terminal C is not age friendly. The next time we fly Aer Lingus we will have to take a wheel chair that otherwise would not be needed .,-1
2022-11-27,0.6,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,3.0,our return was a nightmare,False,"  Just returned from Thanksgiving trip on JetBlue from Albany NY. Our trip out was easy enough but our return was a nightmare. We arrived at 8.03 at Terminal C. Had to walk over a 1/2 mile from the gate to baggage claim, up 2 floors to get to baggage claim area. There was no tram cars available to get a ride on. I am 75 yrs old and my wife is 72. We both have to issues walking distances, and needed to stop a few times to carry on. At the baggage claim we didn’t get our bags until 9.00. This is not a terminal to use for the elderly or those who have problems walking.",-1
2022-11-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,3.0,what happened with the design,False,  Terminal C - what happened with the design of this $2 Billion investment? The parking lot is a nightmare! The arrival hall is on the second floor and the departure on the bottom. Who flipped it on its head? The train station is bigger than average European airport train stations and there are no trains for at least another year and then there will only be a train that goes in one direction to Miami and stops in Cape Canaveral for the cruise connection. Everything in this airport is awkward to say the least. All the food outlets are after security and the multi floor building looks like a greenhouse that lets the sun in - and this in Florida? What about sustainability and eco friendly mess.  I am saddened at the thought of the expense of such an expansion of a major airport that starts of at the wrong foot. It is clear that the designers never traveled abroad and checked in at other airports from Beijing to Singapore or Hong Kong just to mention a few new airports that are inviting and welcoming.  The proof is clearly in the day to day operation: I counted 20 ambassadors helping travelers find their way just from the parking lot to the security area on a regular light travel afternoon. Check it out for yourself!,-1
2022-11-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Arrival at the new terminal C was a joke,False,"  Arrival at the new terminal C was a joke. First the key code to the jetway was lost so we waited 40+ minutes to get off of the plane. Than you have to walk a half mile to the baggage claim up a maze of walkways that are not friendly to passengers that are ederly or have health issues. Than there were only a few customs agents and 500-600 people trying to get through. Took an hour from plane through customs. Than nobody picks up at C because its to far away so you have to walk another half of a mile to the tram, take it to A or B and then catch your transportation. We could have driven to Fort Lauderdale and flown from there and it would have been faster than traveling terminal C. The desighn is terrible.  I blew out my knee 3 weeks ago and it was just on the mend and now it's re-inflamed. This terminal should be shut down.",-1
2022-10-30,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,1.0,3.0,terminal C is a nightmare,False,"  We used to like this airport, but terminal C is a nightmare! 15 minutes until our airplane reached it's parking position, then a 10 minute walk to the baggage claim - no moving walkways - very bad, if you had a long flight, waiting for the bags to arrive and then waiting again for immigration. We touched ground at 6.15pm and exited the airport around 8pm - there were only 2 other flights coming in at that time, imagine, what happens, if it is busy.",-1
2022-10-20,0.2,Family Leisure,4,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,Terminal C just isn't ready for passengers,False,"  Terminal C just isn't ready for passengers. Poor/no road signage, no staff on hand for assistance, no car rentals available, baggage claim woefully inadequate, not allowed to bag drop at terminal instead have to go to terminal A&B and make the long hot outdoor journey from the train to terminal, no trolleys available for transfer to terminal, poor seating, no decent restaurants open, no vending machines, restrooms soaking wet with no hand soap, all staff claim not to work there. Only upside is TSA employees actually have a personality. Honestly, be prepared to be underwhelmed and bring water.",-1
2022-10-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,4,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Absolutely worst TSA service,False,"  Absolutely worst TSA service out of every airport I've ever flown from and/or to. My girlfriend is a diabetic and we were waiting on our connecting flight. I asked 3 different TSA agents whether we would be allowed back through after having to leave out the terminal to even find a vending machine. All 3 said that we could re-enter with no problem. Once we attempted to reenter we were then told that we couldn't and would have to wait until 3am when they could process us because our flight left at 0830. Keep in mind I had already provided connecting flight info to the 3 that I previously asked to avoid having to wait in the long line that will be formed by then. Not a one mentioned that I would have to wait. All 3 told me and my girlfriend that as long as we were back by 12am then we could get through. To make it even better, the night supervisor Alberto was extremely rude and unprofessional and talked to me like I was below him and had a very condescending attitude. I will be directly contacting TSA regarding this and this will be the only time that I ever set foot in this airport again. Any future travel plans to the city of Orlando are hereby gone from my thoughts if this is the quality of service that they provide.",-1
2022-10-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,5,,4.0,0.0,,1.0,2.0,75 minutes to get through passport control,False,  We landed at the airport and it took over 7 minutes to reach our docking station at Terminal C. We were some of the first off due to the class of ticket we had purchased. We then had a 7 minute walk up hill to reach the baggage claim area. There were 4 such carousels and we waited just under 1 hour to collect out bags. They seemed to arrive just about 10 at a time and then wait more until the next 10 came. We were very lucky as just on other carousel was being used. We then had to wait 75 minutes to get through passport control. The old system allowed you to pass through passport control first so the first class passengers went through first. This also allowed time for the bags to arrive and then you were on your way. Passport control first makes the whole process much faster. We then had to walk a far way to reach the trains to Terminal B in order to pick up our car. We landed at 7.25pm and we drove away just before 10.00pm. Someone needs to look into this as passengers will choose airlines that still arrive at Terminal B.,-1
2022-09-28,0.5,Solo Leisure,1,4,,4.0,0.0,,,,Extremely poor planning of the layout,True,"  Extremely poor planning of the layout and opening for the new C Terminal. Be prepared to walk “7 minutes” (a sign tells you like you’re on the freeway lol) up hill to get to the baggage and customs area. Then be prepared to wait another hour plus to get your luggage, presumably because of the distance. Then wait to catch a bus to terminal B to get a car, etc. It’s not even beautiful. The flooring choice couldn’t have been a cheaper epoxy. I noticed the ceiling tiles in the main baggage hall were already dirty since I had nothing to do while waiting for luggage (you’re not supposed to use your phone in this area). Oh yeah, the LED signs were really nice if you ignore all the wires hanging out from the sloppy installation,",-1
2022-09-26,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,5,,4.0,0.0,,,,don’t want to wait for a bag for 1.5 hours,False,"  British Airways flight from London, arrived at 630 and no gate sat on runway for 35 minutes, then some gate issues. Gate issue was British airways problem plane in gate had mechanical issues. Now the fun starts, the walk to customs was a long one, elderly will have an issue with the walk time. In the new terminal international flight baggage is sent directly to the customs area. So you are supposed to pickup your bag and go directly to customs. Now this sounds like a great idea but it’s a disaster. After the long walk I hit the baggage claim at 715 pm, another British airways flight on the same baggage carousel and it’s huge. I finally received my bag at 8.25 pm. I believe they are shipping the bags via conveyor from the gate to customs, that is a long haul and it showed. When I left at 8.25pm, 1/3 plane still waiting for their bags. Plane landed at 6.30pm didn’t get home till 10pm with 1/2 hour ride home. If the long conveyor ride for the bags is the problem they have to fix this and quickly, after a 8 hour plus flight you don’t want to wait for a bag for 1.5 hours.",1
2022-09-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,4,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,"  Our arrival was to terminal A, but our departure coincided with our airline moving to the new terminal C. It’s quite a distance to there, and after walking down long corridors, and negotiating various lifts we finally arrived. Before check in there is only one place to get refreshments, and they were terrible. Despite a board showing a variety of coffee, the only offering from the poorly trained staff was plain coffee , given plastic cup and told to fill it myself from a tepid jug. Check in staff also untrained and dismissive, barely polite. Security another nightmare of errors and misscanning. Airside no better, very little choice of refreshments and a vast almost empty area. Again staffed by poorly trained staff. Worst experience ever, how can you open a new facility in such a busy airport, and not have all the training in place. Never again.",-1
2022-09-23,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,my first and last time here,True,"  Why would an authority open a terminal that has no restaurants, no bars, no shops, no currency exchange, no coffee shops, and the ticket counters lack ability to correspond with the airlines for customer service questions. Why pretend to open on time when the terminal was clearly not ready? Clearly the management has no consideration for travelers, nor shows proper management skills. Better to drive to Tampa with their world class airport. This is my first and last time here.",-1
2022-09-16,0.8,Business,5,4,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,I had an overall good experience,True,"  I had an overall good experience at MCO. While I don't think most airports warrant the reviews they usually get, no airport will ever get a 10/10 rating because the staff are always indifferent, tired, and unfriendly and Orlando is no exception. But they kept everyone moving effectively. Most memorable were the bartenders at the Outback steakhouse in Airside 4. They were in good spirits and seemed eager to be good hosts. The central building was clean and nicely designed. I don't know what it is with Florida airports and monorails, but the system to get you to the gates worked smoothly. The airside building with the gates had a good design because there were lots of amenities in the central part and from there it was 5 minutes or less to any gate. I will warn you that your experience is bound to suck if bad weather causes delays. My flight was delayed 2.5 hours because of a torrential thunderstorm. Orlando is busy because so many small planes are arriving from various places across the country. Delta must have a flight to Atlanta alone every hour. That meant that when the storm ended, the delayed flights were departing at the same time as the flights that hadn't been temporarily diverted. The halls with the gates became extremely crowded and it took almost an hour to takeoff as my flight had to wait in a bloated queue for takeoff.",1
2022-08-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,2.0,unsympathetic sometimes rude workers,False," We arrived within the airline recommended window to catch our 6am flight with what we thought was time to spare. After waiting in one line (following signs) we were told to move to another line for self baggage check-in, only to then have to move to another line to wait in to actually check our bags as if the airline wants as little customer interaction possible. Staff have been polite but a very standoff-ish, forced polite. We then waited in TSA line for well over an hour although a 24 minute wait was posted, rushed to the gate only to be told, along with about 20 others, that our flight was no longer boarding with no guidance or assistance as to what to do to rectify the situation. We secured an alternative flight home on our own, but the two waiting areas at the gates we sat in while waiting were both infested with ants. This flight, 9 hours later, was eventually delayed by 40 minutes and ultimately over 2 hours. Just issue after issue in an unclean place with unsympathetic sometimes rude workers.",-1
2022-06-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,,I am sorry but you should not treat anyone like that,False,"  I don't have the words to describe what an absolute disaster this airport has become. I have lived in Orlando for 34 years and fly frequently. My entire family, adults with their family flew to Dallas. We got there in plenty of time and went to each park 2 cars in the A/B parking lot. There was no signage stating it was full and had to go to the new terminal C. We entered the garage to be told we had to exit and go to C, which by the way is further and unknown. We left and both have clear to be told by an attendant it was a charge of $1.00. We asked how since you could not provide us parking and also exited as soon as we could. Then we drove to C and each parked. The signage there is terrible and also very isolated. My daughter, 6 year old grand daughter got lost and ended up in a closed parking lot. Finally my son was at shuttle and guided me to the terminal to take the shuttle. By then I was so upset I wanted to cry. We finally got to the main terminal and used clear but my son and family got stuck in the security line. His family thankfully made it only because Spirit was running late. Had it been on time they could have missed their flight. We as a family did our part arriving with ample time. This could have been avoided by letting people now to go only to terminal C. I am sorry but you should not treat anyone like that. Travelling these days has become harder and harder. Don't put more stress on us. We pay a lot to fly with most airlines just awful. I hope this is read by someone that will attempt to make it a better situation. My family has to fly to California in July and honestly we are all dreading it already.",-1
2022-05-30,0.1,Business,1,5,,5.0,0.0,,,2.0,TSA is absolutely atrocious,False,"  The TSA is absolutely atrocious, they can’t process individuals fast enough because some of the members rather have conversations with the customers instead of processing them. The lines literally stretch across the airport so you would think it goes without saying to keep your conversation to a minimum. Beyond that, the airport is actually fine.",-1

Checking bags took 45+min and TSA was a joke! 1-2hr wait with lots of stops because the line was so long they couldn't process people. My 3year old had apple juice in a Disney sippy cup that was confiscated (apparently only 2 and under need or get to keep drinks), but we flew here with it no problem. In turn we missed our plane by minutes. At least we got to watch our flight leave us. TSA thanks for keeping America safe from Apple juice. Now we can spend $5 and deal with a upset toddler.",-1

Half of our items we put through TSA were broken after they shoved them in and were not accommodable whatsoever. Plane didn’t even leave for an hour plus after everyone was seated.",-1
2021-12-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,it was chaos and no one was friendly or helpful,False,"  You know it is not always the passenger that is in the wrong. Our party of 15 came in with time to check in. The hotel should have sent the shuttle about 30 minutes earlier, but we made it to the airport. From there it was chaos and no one was friendly or helpful. I know the staff must be under a lot of stress, but that is no reason to be rude and unhelpful to the passengers who just want to get to their destination. Not all of us want to prove a point, and we all were ok with wearing the proper mask and thought we were following the proper rules. Because of the TSA lines and overkill on patting down passengers and 10 steps in the wrong direction, and a very rude and probably tired official there were 3 out of the 15 who missed the flight and spent the next 29 hours getting home. Because of this there were 3 seats that could have been used by 3 people in need, but used by the 3 of us who needed to get home. Our flight that we should have been on, had 3 empty seats. Because of this action at the airport 3 of us slept in the airport, was witness to a person walking around nude at 3am in the Orlando airport, waited for security to attend to this poor confused person 25 minutes, and had to fly to Dallas and then from there to Madison WI. The rude and overkill with the TSA team slowed down the process even more. There are always two sides to every story.",-1
2021-12-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,I'm totally shocked with their treatment,False,  My family arrived at the airport in plenty of time to catch their flight back to the UK only to stand in the check in queue for an hour and twenty minutes and only move a few feet. On trying to do self check in unsuccessfully they asked for help only to be treated very rudely by airport staff. They then went back to the check in queue and again approached several members of staff as there was only an hour till their flight left and again were treated very badly by the most unhelpful staff. They eventually made their flight with minutes to spare my sister who was travelling has MS and is in a wheelchair the stress of her flight home had totally put her off coming again as any stress impacts on her MS symptoms. I'm totally shocked with their treatment especially as MCO is usually excellent with disabled passengers.,-1

2021-11-08,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,4,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,get your security acting right,True,"  It's a clean and straightforward airport. A lot of little food places to visit and seating if you need it. However, the TSA staff there is extremely rude. I understand they have to take their jobs seriously however, they do not need to treat us paying travelers like we're pieces of garbage. I'm a young woman traveling alone and I don't need any man talking down to me and you can't even get ""thank you, have a nice day,"" from them. They were extremely rude about the mask I wore and told me to put a real mask on, even though it covered my mouth and nose. The mask I wear is an alternative for my asthma and how I am able to comply with it where it's needed. Meanwhile there were people walking around with none on at all so I don't even want to hear it. Maybe you need to train your people in common courtesy to others to make it a more pleasant experience while you're there. Glad they keep it clean and tidy, but seriously, get your security acting right with the paying customers who are supporting their paycheck.",1

As I thought the bin was stuck, not that she purposely pushed it at an angle, I fixed it and she picked it up and slammed it back down to back to being at an angle. If I saw this is how she wanted it you think I would I fixed it? No, I would’ve left it. This lady needs some sunshine from this so called sunshine state. We get it you’re busy but the other workers were pleasant and joked around. The same worker also stated what you don’t care about your belongings? As they’re motioning for us to go through the scanning. Well if our items were pushed through and not held for so long we would’ve been fine. Maybe we will be driving to Florida next time.",-1

I panicked and TSA helped me and looked with me for my watch. They gave me an number to contact them and and fill out forms online.

For being the happiest place on earth I would say don’t bother. Disney, Universal, Sea World all need to step in and force this city to step up their game. No cold drinks to buy, luggage takes for ever to get unloaded, bathrooms broken, dirty and sinks not working. With the amount of money coming through this airport. There is no reason not to elevate.

In July of 2021 l visited my son for a week. I flew Frontier from Rochester to Orlando which was just fine but the experience back was less than pleasant. The staff at the airport seemed to be trained in inconsiderate customer service. They’re rude and crude for the most part. I will say that the gentlemen that checked me in at the Frontier counter was very pleasant. He was THE only pleasant employee l experience during my 2 hour stay in the airport. The worst thing l encountered is that airport gate 16 smelled liked urine no matter where stood or sat. I feel that this is the one airport that should be setting an example for our nation since it is the number one vacation destination. Get it together Orlando! There is no need for the dirty smelly airport!",-1
2021-07-06,0.2,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,Very rude TSA,False," Very rude TSA. Not 1 person I encountered was nice! Traveled with many family members. On the way to security checkpoint, 1st TSA encounter: was yelled at while I was with my two young children (to walk shoulder-to-shoulder side by side: difficult to do when 1 child was in a stroller). 2nd encounter near check point was told to scan my tickets with another very rude TSA worker who called me back as I was about to walk to get a body scan, he was upset and had a very mean/annoyed facial expression. Again yelled at: “who are they!” I replied “my children Sir, I scanned my ticket sir”. 3rd Encounter and thankfully the last! I had to dump my sons water from his bottle at a close trash bin (didn’t happen at JFK airport where I’m originally from as the TSA there was friendly and performed a test to check the water, lady smiled and I was on my way). Had to throw away a plastic spray/sip bottle that I was unaware contained approximately 1 ounce of water. I asked if he can just please allow me to dump that water out as well and was told “No, it’s too late” but he let me dump my sons water from his bottle. I was totally confused as I watched him confiscate it. He then checked my sons backpack and took his 4 oz unopened juice box and tossed it! As I said before I was traveling with many other family member and other children who were all able to keep their juice boxes from another TSA worker a different line. Worst experience of my life traveling through Orlando Florida airport! And I’m from NYC.",-1
2021-06-10,0.2,Family Leisure,2,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,go through security check again,True,"  We arrived at the airport 2 hours early as a precaution of the long security checks. We got through the security checks after 30 minutes (what a relief) so our family of 6 decided to use the lounge membership before departure. Our departure is Terminal B gate 35. One of the lounge is located in Terminal B, gate 1-29. We took the tram to the lounge. After finished, we have to take the tram back to tram lobby area (this is the security clearance area after the checkpoint) to take another tram to our gate 35. The TSA employee closed the door and told us we all have to exit and go through security check again, although we have already waited in line and completed the security checks for 6 people. We had only 10 minutes to complete the security checks before our plane boards. The tram for gate 1-29 is the only tram that is separated by ""Exit"" door once the passengers depart the tram lobby area. The logistic of this tram design is so absurd that even though passengers already went through security check, but if you use the lounge (tram 1-29), and have to depart to any other gate, you have to go through security again. Airport Logistics Department need to re-assess this as this will cause passengers to crowd checkpoint lines and miss their flight. Very frustrated that this happened.",-1
2021-05-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I’ve never seen anything like it in my life,False,"  Literally the worst airport experience I’ve ever had in my life. If you can help it at all, do not fly into or out of this airport. We were departing back to Philadelphia from Florida yesterday and arrived at the airport with 2 hours and 45 minutes before our flight. Walked into a line wrapped around the entire one side of the airport wondering what the hell was going on. Turns out it was the security line. There had to be over 600 people in this line, all very disgruntled to say the least. It took us over two hours to get to security. We rushed our things through and ran to catch the shuttle with our shoe laces untied. Luckily got onto the shuttle as the doors were closing and sprinted to our gate from there with about 5 minutes to spare before the doors closed and we missed our flight. The thought of missed our flight only to have to go back to ticketing and returning to that torturous security line again was enough to make us prepare to drive two hours to another airport to fly out of. Despite the fact that we made our frontier flight by a hair, we ended up sitting on the plane for another 30 minutes to wait for the 56 (!!) passengers that were still not present for that was supposed to be a full flight. The airline waited for about half of them to get onto the plane and had to leave the other 20 some passengers behind. This experience alone made an otherwise decent trip a horrible experience that we were left with. I will never ever ever fly into or out of this airport again and urge others to consider the same. Aside from the insane waiting and stressful rushing to our gate, the staff at the airport was very rude and cavalier about the situation. Non apologetic, no concern and just flat out rude. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. On top of everything, we were practically starving for a period of 5 hours since the time we thought we might have to grab a quick bite before our flight was spent stressing in an insane line and frontier doesn’t serve anything on the plan for passengers. I would have rather driven to Florida. Also, I was forced to give this airport one star for some reason, but they deserve negative stars. Steer clear!",-1

I have been treated so poorly by ever staff member I come into contact with. Where do I start besides saying I am an experienced flier with many miles under my belt. The lady at the Camden food co. Counter slapped the counter several times, forcefully trying to get me to move up in line. I couldn't because the people in front of me were still moving their bags. I said have a nice day and she said ""whatever"". Shall we start with TSA now? I was being told to step closer by a TSA agent who was farther away. I could not hear them because of the masks. The TSA agent in front of me said, ""hey, Dumbo come get in now, shouted and talked down at me just to stand on the yellow feet and put up my arms. She then starts to grab my arm and pull me out of the machine. She said ""keep the line moving boy"" boy? Who do you think you are. I gave them no reason to treat me like that.",-1

On the day it was time to return home it took an hour to make it through TSA. These lines were nothing I have seen before in my history of traveling. It was worst than customs ×3. They were rude and everyone is doing something different. One say take electronics out while the other say leave it in. Then when I told her the lady just said leave the electronics in, one TSA employee says ""I don't know what airport said that to you"". I had enough at this point. I told her this airport told me that and as a matter of fact it was your coworker. Ended up missing my flight and had to stay another day.",-1

I was travelling alone with a toddler and they were very helpful. Then I went through Security and that was the worst. I am not a frequent flyer. I explained this. Mind you, the airport was empty. I'm flying for the 2nd time in my life and they huffed and puffed when I asked simple questions. I did not know to get out 4-5 plastic tubs myself for my things, while making sure the grandbaby is still next to me. So they had to help and were very displeased. Then I ask where to find my terminal. The employee rolled his eyes and pointed to the left. I asked if I needed to get on the train. Another employee laughed and asked if I was serious. Yes, in Atlanta you can actually walk to some terminals so I was unsure. Not all people fly all of the time. Have some patience. Treat people with respect and don't assume they know their way around. There were no other passengers anywhere to follow or ask. Sorry I had to interrupt them from socializing with each other, but their rudeness will never be forgotten.",-1

I have suffered the tortures of the dammed because the signage is terrible. You closed the B side car rental but you have failed to notify the public. I have looked but found not a single sign. I fly Delta so I use the B terminal. Well to my dismay and consternation I find no signage telling me where to find Delta. I do see a sign that tells me about all the other airlines in the A terminal. What do you have against Delta? Now I know why your airport was rated just above Newark. I wonder if a news report about these shortcomings at MCO would be interesting reading on several websites as I have now twice tried to report these problems on your website but it errors out every time.,-1

2020-03-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,3,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Shame on airport management,True, We arrived at MCO (Orlando Airport) on Mar 18 at 11.00 pm. Airport was fairly empty as expected except apparently a couple of other planes arrived around the same time. Airport security or TSA whomever controls the trams from the gates to the terminal shut down all but 2 tram cars just as 200-250 people were trying to go from gates to the terminal. With all the concern over Covid19 why in the heck would the airport jam all those people into 2 trams. It probably took 2-3 trips back to the terminal to move all the people. We happened to be on the front end of that crowd and once in the tram had no chance to socially distance ourselves from anyone. It was like stuffing sardines into a can. There were 4-6 airport personnel controlling the situation and they all were obvious to any social distancing requirement being imposed for health purposes. It was 11.00 pm which must have been quitting time and they just did what they did every other night when 11.00 pm arrived. Please allow them to understand what is going on in the world today and try to assist in stopping this current virus. If you cannot allow the employees to make better decisions on their own then airport management needs to be in field understanding what is happening in your airport. Shame on airport management.,-1

2020-02-04,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,,customer service needs a lot of attention,True, This is the worst airport I’ve ever been to. The people at the security are so rude and mean. When the lady was telling me to put my feet in the yellow lines I didn’t hear her so she continued to scream it at me. Next my purse gets checked and the man very rudely asks if I have anything in there that will hurt him. I’m a 20 year old white girl I don’t even know how to work a can opener sometimes. Then he pulls out my victoria secret perfume and says this is too big to go through security so I can destroy right here in front of you or you can mail it to yourself. Throws the perfume at me and doesn’t direct me to any kind of ups or anything so eventually I got tired of going in circles and threw my item away. Now I’m sitting here waiting for my plane and crying. Isn’t this supposed to be about customer service? What is the point of being rude to everyone you encounter? The customer service needs a lot of attention. How can you expect people to enjoy their time and get good reviews if y’all act like this. I haven’t read one good review since because this places is straight trash.,-1

People travel from all over the world to visit this city and this is the best the city can do? Trash simply put. 1) Poor restaurant choices. 2) Limited number of restaurants. 3) Horrible selection of restaurants (you've never heard of most of them, few franchises). 4) Horrible security/TSA lines with no organization, crowding people like cattle before the ID check and then subjecting them to a surprise Disney-esque maze lineup after BEFORE getting to screeners. 5) Slow shuttles to gates. 6) Limited seating at Food Court. 7) Limited seating a gates.

It’s dirty. TSA lines are usually long, the agents rude, and the last couple of times the TSA Pre-Check lines have been shut down. The restaurants selections are the worst of any airport in the US I’ve been to and once you get through TSA your choices are even more dismal. Tonight our flight has been delayed by two hours. The only sit down restaurant at our terminal stops serving food at 9 and there’s only one location in the terminal where you can get an adult beverage.

Items that in any store cost $1.25 were priced at $3.50 - basic sandwiches at over $10. Remind me to drive next time. TSA did a great job despite heavy volume.,-1
2019-06-11,0.1,Business,2,2,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,by far my least favorite airport,False,"  This is by far my least favorite airport to fly into or out of in the entire country. I fly fairly frequently (1-2 times per month) and every time I fly here people are cold, unfriendly, and not helpful at all. I've had people stand and stare at me waiting in line for coffee, only to tell me 5 minutes later they closed the line. I've been yelled at for not getting in the closest general screening line when there is an obvious general line that is shorter. Today, a security agent squeezed behind me with a cart full of bins, then get mad at me when I accidentally backed up and turned around to apologize (never even had the chance to say anything). Other airports also do a far better job of posting what you can and cannot bring on board, but I've been behind someone in security with full-size shampoo products. The seating area is really dirty today, and the bathrooms are overcrowded. I enjoy Chicago airport. I love Denver. Even LAX is tolerable if you have the right attitude. But for some reason, every time I fly through MCO it is a stressful and unpleasant experience.",-1

We approached security not one person offered to help remove the bassinet from the stroller so it would fit through the belt or help close the stroller. I have my baby in my arms removing my shoes taking out my iPad and struggling to get the stroller on the belt and not one person offered to help. Even after we were scanned and everything had passed through still not one of the 5 TSA who were standing around asked if they could assist me. The security staff here needs a class in customer service. So disgusted with them.,-1

2019-05-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,4,1,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,the worst airport I have been to,True," Orlando International Airport. Airport code MCO. This is not my first time in MCO. I have been to this airport a few times. This is probably the worst airport I have been to. I have travelled to many different cities and countries and gone thru many airports. First, this airport's layout, it is just stupid. They make you go back and forth for no reason and you need to take monorail. The monorail was surprisingly fast and effective. Cleanliness of airport is very questionable. It is not a clean airport. Many places are dirty and the bathroom is Mr Cleans nightmare. I hardly saw any cleaning staff in the airport. What makes this airport the worst is the staff who work in the airport. Many are just rude and lazy. Even the baggage handler thinks he owns the airport. So don’t expect service or courteous here. Most likely you will get yelled at for bothering them. TSA here is joke. I saw 20 TSA, 3 TSA agents working and 17 TSA just standing around talking and laughing. I approached one of TSA to ask question. Her response, “just go over there.” Apparently sharing a joke with her friend is more important than the security of the airport. I thought Newark airport was bad but compared to MCO Newark airport is a well oiled machine. Once again, staff in the airport are what makes this airport the worst airport. Only bright thing about this airport is the immigration agent. Most of them are very professional and courteous. Everyone seems to be trained very well. If possible, avoid this airport.",-1

The Airport looks like it's stuck in the 1970's and would need a renovation. Overall the check-in process is smooth, but the security can take longer than expected. There is an ok amount of resturants and bars, and there is not enough seating at the gates leading to a lot of passengers having to stand up.",1
2019-01-15,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,ridiculous process,False," Coming from Stockholm we had a very long flight only to wait an hour or so before immigration moved just a little at a time. While being there another hours a flight arrived and you saw the passengers arriving into the already established que's only to be yield at by officials as if they were small children and rudely! To get back to the plane they left and stand by. The official also informed those passengers that they were not going to be processed because the airlines they flew did not file the proper paperwork and they were unexpected! We made it through immigration recovered our checked baggage pleasantly surprised by being given a free cart, rolled through the customs door then told to unload the carts were not allowed to be used to take the luggage anywhere and we were told to place our luggage on the conveyor, told it could take as long as 3 hours to show up at the main portion of the airport. No passengers put there luggage while we were there they all struggled and all helped each other carry their luggage back to the main terminal. Ive been to many Airports across the world. Never have I ran into an additional 3 hour process at the end of customs in any airport at any country. What a waste of big money. why did not the airport let the cart vender rent carts out there rather than spend millions on conveyors that no one will want to use. Also no signs or instructions regarding this portion of the process. It was a melt down just waiting to happen every 10 minutes. They had such a nice appearance when we departed, arriving was a nightmare more than anywere Ive been in 30 years. The staff seemed to try to manage dealing with the ridiculous process. It took us a few moments to carefully stack all our luggage up on the free cart. For a 10 second push 15 feet?",-1
2019-01-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,5,,5.0,4.0,,,,unpleasant arrival experience,True," Most unpleasant arrival experience in my life. Arrived at 10 pm on January the 7th from Panama and went directly to immigration line (visitors). Very disappointed to see that there were only 2 agents allocated for our line, while that line for locals had more than 7 agents. As a result it took us more than 1:30h to pass the immigration controls. Then, they took me to the customs office with the excuse of having a common name (they didn't provide more explanations but the way the agent explained didn't sound very convincing, besides it was the first time that it happened to me in US territory). Time spent in the office, 30 minutes. After the office I finally got to pick my lugagge, only to discover that it had to go through a 2nd security check and that we had to pick it in another terminal. Sadly when we got to the pick up terminal, part of the lugagge didn't come out. Nobody from the airport or airline was present to assist us. I asked to another passenger in the same situation and he told me that this messy inconvenient was really normal in the airport. We sat for more than 1 hour besides the belts, until the last bag finally came out. It took me 3 hours to fly from Panama to Orlando and incredibly it took me more than 4 hours to try to go out of the Airport. These guys have no idea of customer experience. I know security is a priority but it doesn't give them the right to provide such a poor service. If I don't know how to treat my guests I simply don't invite them.",-1

2019-01-07,0.4,Family Leisure,4,4,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,it is horribly outdated,False,"  We arrived later in the evening. Our plane was delayed, so we got something to eat in the main terminal. I'm glad we did, because there were few options near our gate. Because we ate first, security was short (it was horribly long before we ate). My biggest issue is that for an international airport at a major tourist destination, it is horribly outdated. For us, specifically, it is a huge lack of charging stations. We were at the gate 15 waiting area. In that area, there were 6 outlets, each with 2 outlets and 2 USB chargers. That makes a total of 24 people who can charge a device. Get with it. Most modern airports (we live in Denver and use DIA regularly, but have seen it at most other parts airports as well) have seats that charge, so every passenger has the opportunity to do so. In this information age, we all use our devices for everything from business, to email, to boarding passes, to transportation (Uber, etc.). We had been gone from our lodging most of the day and arrived with devices in need for charging. Do you have a plan for when a passenger arrives with an electronic boarding pass, but their phone dies before boarding because they couldn't charge it?",-1

During holiday season travel rush, the airport closed all TSA precheck lines and created massive queues, herding everyone into general security check lines.

It was the absolutely worst security experience I have ever experienced of any airport, any country! Avoid MCO at all cost!",-1

Driving into the airport required a toll road and most rental cars charge more without sun pass.

",True," Three planes came in together and there was over 800 people in the immigration hall with three officers on. We saw people collapse and children were crying. We waited over two hours as this airport has done away with special assistance, my wife has muscular dystrophy and is in a wheelchair. We will never again fly into this airport. It’s appalling. What a horrendous way to treat your visitors. Virgin sent us a text before we arrived apologising for the wait in the immigration hall so obviously people had complained to them.",-1
2018-11-14,0.3,Family Leisure,3,4,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,there is no signage,True," Orlando International has two separate security check points in terminal B that are gate specific. Our boarding pass that we got printed a few minutes prior to going through security didn’t list a gate. Having not been to the airport before we just got into the first check point with our kids and all the carry-ons. It took about 20 minutes before we got to the TSA desk at which time they told us we had to leave and go to the other check point. We then waited in line another 20 minutes to get to the security screening in the second checkpoint line. Our complaint is that first the gate should be printed on the boarding pass as clearly the TSA counter had this information 20 minutes later. Second, there is no signage or employees going around checking to inform travelers they are in the right checkpoint. We all expect some wait at the airport but things like this are simply maddening! Further, when we talked to the TSA folks, they rolled their eyes like this is a very common thing and they wished it wasn’t that way. So my question is this, why isn’t the airport leadership taking this on as an issue to be corrected? Also, the gates for Delta were super crowded! We had to stand the entire time waiting to board, which isn’t easy with small children.",-1

I was traveling there because my daughter was having surgery so my mind was scattered. Once I landed after flying for 5+ hours, I was ready to catch Uber and get to her house before her surgery early the next morning. As I was taking off an outer coat due to the 40 degree warmer weather, I set my purse down. When I gathered my things as the Uber driver came up, I left my purse on the planter. Of course when we got to her house - no purse. My Uber driver was going back to the airport and offered to see if he could locate it when I gratefully appreciated. My daughter went on line to file a lost and found report. We prayed and moments later, a detective  called. They had been trying to locate me for more than 30 minutes. The Security Guard at the airport found my purse and immediately turned it in. When I spoke to the Detective, I thanked him profusely and asked about next steps. He said Lost and Found would contact me the next morning. They did - twice. They confirmed the contents with me and gave me instructions as to how to pick it up. I told them I would come after my daughter's surgery was over and they understood completely. Around 1pm the next day, I went back to the airport and found them - they were already waiting for me. I asked how I could repay them - tips, writing letters of appreciation or what. They said none of that was necessary and asked how my daughter was. All I can say is how much I truly appreciated their integrity, concern and graciousness. I will highly recommend the Orlando Airport and Orlando in general and a wonderful place to visit!",1

You have to walk and going up and down to reach your luggages and the parking. Also the staff at security gates (TSA) are not fit to handle customers. They are rude, impolite and unprofessional.

2018-09-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,Security is horrendous,True," TSA/Security is horrendous and caused us to almost miss our flight. We checked the airport app upon arrival and the estimated wait time for Gates 1-59 security was 6-10 minutes. So we took our time, got some coffee, etc. My wife checked the app again a bit later and suddenly the wait time was 22-26 minutes. We hurried over and discovered the chaos that is MCO security. Several times, several lines merged into one or branched from one line to several. It was like herding cattle. The last time the line branched we apparently chose the wrong line. It just wasn't moving and when we finally got to the front we find that the bag scanner wasn't working properly. All told, it took me 47 minutes to get through security, but it didn't end there for my wife. Her bag was pulled out to be searched, along with a few others'. I went on to the gate to plead with the gate agent because we were about to miss our flight. My wife tells me that the two bags in front of hers were searched because of 1) Disney picture frames, and 2) a hairbrush. For her, it was a handful of quarters. She ran to the tram, then from the tram towards the gate. Luckily I saw her just as the gate agents closed the door. I told them she was on her way and pleaded with them to let us board. They reopened the doors for us and let us on. TSA was rude and condescending, though. I witnessed it myself but my wife tells me it got even worse after I left.

",False,"  I have been travelling to Orlando for over 25 years for vacation and work, and over the last 9 months this immigration situation has gone from bad to appalling. You arrive after 9.5 hours in the air to go through a small area with no refreshments or bathroom facilities and then you put your passport into the machines getting a ticket which has cleared you for entry. Once out of this area you are the herded by ill informed rude staff to meet the customs officials and get asked the same questions by these people, some of whom are really nice others can be really obnoxious. So you land at 3.30 pm and get your baggage at 6.00 p.m. Not acceptable. Get this new area sorted get your entry system sorted, get your staff trained in customer service. I have been into dozens of US and other country customs area and this is by far the worse.",-1
2018-08-31,0.7,Couple Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,2.0,revaluate wheelchair service,False," Wheelchair passengers had to wait 15 extra minutes on the plane before wheelchairs arrived at the gate, even though they wheelchairs had been requested in advance. Then, once we deplaned and had our wheelchairs we had to wait additional time before anyone arrived to push us. OIA needs to revaluate their wheelchair service contractor and demand that they hire additional people and buy more wheelchairs. It's a good thing we didn't have a connecting flight or we could have missed it.",1
2018-08-30,0.9,Solo Leisure,4,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,definitely my favorite,False," MCO being my home airport is definitely my favorite, but I have many reasons that would put this under favorites for many non-floridians. First of all I am a frequent flyer and with TSA-Pre Check you can zip through security lines here. The airport is organized and although there is a high amount of passenger traffic everything runs smoothly. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas as well as an Apple store which is awesome. The airport is super clean and transportation shuttles are everywhere so you will always get to your gate on time. I have almost never experienced delays at this airport even during international departures. There is also great Wi-Fi through out the whole airport. Customer service and staff are calm and helpful and always cheerful! The only thing I would add to this airport is more international gates to increase international traffic. The overall experience is amazing though, so if you ever fly into Florida I recommend Orlando International Airport!",1
2018-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,an awful place,False," I was very disappointed in the Orlando Airport. The lines are extremely long going through security and the airport employees are very rude, disrespectful and loud. I would never hire any of them to deal with any of my customers. I have been through that airport now three times, and always the same thing. I feel sorry for the first time flyer- it’s an awful place! All they need to do is be nice. If I treated my customers this way I would be fired!",-1
2018-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,tired and ill-prepared airport,True," Worst airport I have come across and totally unacceptable for a destination that relies almost entirely on tourism. It is an unfriendly, tired and ill-prepared airport to arrive in. We were held on the plane for 40 minutes because they had no space for us in the arrival halls and then we had to wait in 'holding pens' for a couple of hours in endlessly long snaking queues standing up. Everyone had arrived at that time from long haul flights, so already exhausted. All the children were crying, there were no seats available for those who needed to sit. Nobody wants to spend three hours getting through the airport when they have travelled so far and then need to travel further to their final destination. The ceilings were all coming apart, everything looked very tired and not fit for purpose. Even an apology over the tannoy system would have been appreciated but there was nothing. Only commands to not use your phone or camera. I would avoid this airport at all costs. Plus the signage throughout is terrible!",-1
2018-07-27,0.4,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,Very tiring airport,True," Arrived at MCO on September 27, departed on October 3, with my wife visiting Disneyland. Very tiring airport, as after arrival have to take a shuttle to reach main terminal and then got to go down a level to collect luggage. Collecting luggage is not the easiest task as there is not enough space to wait around the carousel - tends to be busy most of the time due to Disneyland! Fairly warm as well. Signage there is not as clear as in other airports. Got to ask staff for info most of the time. Most staff are polite and try to help. Similar situation for departure, but signage is a bit better. TSA is much more strenuous than in MIA - put me aside for further check because they ""found something on my clothing"", even though I was wearing just a polo shirt, flip flop no belt and had removed my watch and rings. Then they emptied my carry on and checked my Hersheys chocolate - ""Hugs"", ""Kisses"", etc! An airport that makes you feel tired! I would say avoid it if you can!",-1
2018-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,passport lines were too long,False,"  On our arrival from Paris, we were kept in the airplane for 50 minutes because, we were told, the passport lines were too long and there was not enough space in the passport/customs entry area. When we were finally let out of the plane, we were taken to a holding area, where we waited for another 20 minutes, and because my wife and I had Global Entry, we were allowed to proceed at that point to the passport area. Goodness knows how much longer the other passengers, visitors and US citizens mixed together had to wait before being let into the passport lines, which were long enough that it would have taken at least two hours total from landing for them to enter the country. Once we got to the Global Entry line there were only two machines, and one was out of service. The one machine available did not operate properly for many of those in the line with us and in my case it failed to recognize that I had Global Entry, even though the passport official we finally got to admitted that we did. A disastrous experience overall and a wonder that any foreign visitors arrive in Orlando or US citizens decide to use MCO as their international gateway. We live in the area but are now considering abandoning nonstop overseas flights from Orlando in favor of other gateways.",-1
2018-07-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,The heat was unbearable,False,"  Worst travel experience of my life. We arrived in Orlando, took around 2 hours to get through immigration with only half of the desks open. We had a family waiting behind us with three young children which included a very young baby. The heat was unbearable, the baby was screaming all the way through, the other children were watching cartoons on their mothers phone in which a security guard told her to put it away as phones were not allowed. The majority of the plane were families with young children and had similar experiences, I had a toddler with me as well. Its an absolutely cruel experience for the little ones. We waited over an hour in a room for our luggage, in which three other flights of people were waiting too. We then had to get a shuttle to the main airport to leave, there was no elevators and I was told by the security guard that I could not go on the escalator with a pram/stroller, I had to drag the pram with a toddler in my arms up the flight of stairs, with two security guards watching happily (I was previously told I would be assisted). A security guard was directing the flock of people through to the shuttle inwhich she had physically pushed my sister in that direction due to it being so over-crowded. In all it took us around 4 hours to get out of the airport, as we waited a silly amount of time to get the rental car out as well. The whole experience was exhausting and cruel, if we decide to visit Orlando again we will definitely be looking at alternative airports.",-1
2018-06-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,"wow what a wait""
",False,"  Well we were warned but wow what a wait! After a long flight into Orlando we disembarked the flight into a corridor and waited and waited and waited. Eventually someone came to get passengers with connecting flights but no explanation. We carried on waiting, the children were tired and thirsty and the corridor was hot. We finally got told that 5 large flights had arrived all at once. I assume this was the schedule and therefore was expected so why could they not either: advise people before they left the plane to be prepared for a wait or have more staff or organise some refreshment in the corridor or even better just advise people of the situation. What was worse was that upon getting the end of the corridor, there was a huge long snaking queue in the customs hall. It took us 3 hours to clear Orlando airport and then we had a 2 hour drive. Never again. I will find another route into South West Florida. Even the Virgin staff looked sympathetic and incredulous at our plight!",-1
2018-06-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,worst airport I have ever experienced,False,"  Absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst airport I have ever experienced. I travel frequently and am forced to fly to Orlando once per year to go to UFL. I always dread this airport and today is no exception. Long lines, fed up security staff, very few services whilst you wait for your flight. This time I was met by a 3 page waitlist for the lounge and a completely full bar at every single outlet (all 2 of them). Seriously Orlando, get your act together.",-1

I have been to this airport many times for vacation and I am considering going to a different airport next time.,-1
2018-05-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,It was an absolute shambles,True," This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst airport I have ever flown to. Upon arrival, we were not allowed to disembark the aircraft due to 'congestion in the terminal'. After a 20 minute or so wait, we were allowed off, only to find ourselves queuing in a hot corridor and then a further room for about 50 minutes to get to the machines which have replaced the landing cards. The machines were unmanned with no one on hand to help. It was an absolute shambles. Once we had mastered the machines and taken our printouts, it was into yet another monstrous queue to get through immigration. Orlando airport is an absolute joke. Considering its importance to the tourist industry there, you would expect that there would be investment of some kind to sort it out. Next time, I will fly via one of the hubs which are capable of handling large passenger numbers at an international airport.",-1
2018-05-14,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,worst airport I have used,False,"  This is without doubt the worst airport I have used. We arrived on time using BA, on arrival we were herded into a large hall for 45 minutes with no explanation, after this it took another 45 minutes to get through passport control. The whole airport was shabby and dated.",-1
2018-05-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,whole airport is terrible,False," Probably the worst airport I've been to. On arrival we were crammed into a tiny waiting area for security screening. Two planes worth all trying to get through the tiny area. It was also hot and stuffy. Once through the security question machines we then had to wait in queues for passport check. The whole airport is terrible and a trip hazard as ita going under works or its falling apart. The signage is poor and you have no idea where you're going especially for car rental. The tram from the terminal to the main terminal was unsafe, such a small waiting area which filled quickly then more people kept coming up the escalator not knowing how full it was had no where to go, it was chaos. It took us over 2 and a half hours to get out of the airport. On departure finding the check in desks was actually fine but more chaos from there. We arrived the 2 hours before checked in straight away then was met by 45 minute wait to get through security, there was no movement at all in any of the queues. It got to the point where I had to go and tell our airline we weren't going to make the flight to which they escorted us through. But even with an escort it was slow. Departure lounge and seating was poor, then the airport had delays so the plane was delayed landing. Thing we will be trying the other airport at Orlando",-1
2018-04-30,0.3,Family Leisure,1,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,queues totally unacceptable,False,"  For a supposedly International airport they are not geared up for large scale passenger arrival numbers. The queues were totally unacceptable, I have waited less time with more people in New Delhi for goodness sake! And why is it when you get through and collect your luggage there are no lifts up to the transit level. You have to struggle with the cases up a metal staired escalator. Not good at all.",-1

Such a lovely place to visit but you are left with a bad taste departing from this airport. We left late afternoon on a Tuesday. Rental return also brutal.,-1
2018-04-12,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,It was an absolute mess,False,"  The most unorganised airport security I have ever encountered. It was an absolute mess, lines not properly defined, no clear signs very little room to get organised. We waited over 30 minutes with no communication only for K9 team to be brought out and even then it took a further 15 minutes to get through the scanners. Shops and food places closing by 9 too in an airport where flights were still departing after this time. Very little choice for food and drink. One restaurant by our gates which couldn't cope with the demand and closed early. Extremely disappointing experience and would put me off visiting Orlando again.",-1

",True," Orlando is my home and I think overall the airport does a great job. My only issue is the length of time it takes to get bags. Yesterday I waited an hour. While I was there there were several announcements of changes to where other flights luggage was arriving and a lot of frustrated people. Not a great first impression for our visitors. BTW, there was no storm which understandable cause the lightning delays we have in the summer.",1

My husband, who’s a police officer, often travels with a fire arm in his checked bag. When checking our bags mine went on a belt right at the Sun Counrty ticket desk. However his that had the firearm in a locked box in the suit case needed to be opened at the desk. Then had to be taken to a complete different area of the airport to be checked by TSA. While I know they take extra precautions why is it so far away? While on the trek downstairs to baggage claim where TSA is I thought to myself I hope his bag finds the right plane. Once landed at MSP and at baggage claim his bag wasn’t there. Honestly this is probably a Sun County and a MCO problem as we’ve contacted both and both seem to not understand the severity of the situation. The only people that took it seriously were the MSP airport police when we filed the claim.",-1
2018-03-04,0.1,Business,1,2,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,unprofessional and outright hostile,True," I fly a lot for business and I have rarely been so disgusted with the unprofessional and outright hostile and demeaning attitude of the TSA screeners. To start with, the entire process of going through TSA security took 35 minutes. Despite people queuing up all the way into the atrium of the airport, TSA only had a few lines open. One of them was fully staffed but TSA officers were just standing around, laughing and high-fiving each other for several minutes. Then, they allowed a number of people who had only just entered, to proceed to this newly opened line, when everyone else who had been waiting for 15+ minutes were kept waiting. One particular demeaning and nasty TSA individual on a power trip was working the line I went through. As usual, there were no bins to put items in so I waited next to the belt. I was then yelled at ""Why are you standing around, you're holding up the line"". I politely explained that I was waiting for them to restock the bins to which he responded by yelling at me, ""Nobody told you to do that, keep moving. You're holding up the line"". I turned to the passengers behind me, and they looked as apologetic as I did. Another TSA worker then quickly restocked the bins, but the hostility and rudeness of the TSA staff really shocked me. I don't think I will be traveling through this airport again if I can avoid it, and rather attend my meeting as a phone call, or worst case, drive. I know TSA does not employ people for their customer service qualities, but is it necessary to become so hostile to passengers?",-1

",True," As always, incredibly busy and too congested. Flew Frontier and not many choices for dinner.

Miserable time again at this airport.",-1
2018-02-07,0.3,Business,1,3,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,Terrible security,True," Terrible security. I literally had 3 merge lanes in TSA. This was like moving cattle and survival of the fittest. People pushed by saying they were missing a plane. TSA did nothing. Projected wait times said 27 minutes and here it is 1 hour later. To top things off by the time my bag went through the check site, TSA stopped paying attention causing luggage to jam up, fall off and a suitcase flipped my laptop bin, crashing it off conveyor and slamming a hard case suitcase on top. Clown show and embarrassing as an Orlando FL, resident. I am starting this business trip in a terrible mood and possibly filing a claim for a damaged computer.",-1
2018-01-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"by far the worst airport experience""
",True," This by far the worst airport experience I have had in a long time. The staff were doing busy-work but the administration is very poorly organized. Our Southwest flight (outbound in 40 minutes) did not show up on the departure screens and the information booth said they were not aware of any outbound flights to that destination around the given time. Unlike most airports, different gate groupings are not connected to each other, which is fine, but it doesn’t say that explicitly at the security check point. A confusing sign at one of the gates made it seem like it would be OK to go through any checkpoint. Fortunately our e-boarding pass finally updated with the gate number but we were on the wrong side of gate groupings. We had to double back out and make it through the other side. God bless you if you have to fly out of this airport.",-1

This is the worst airport I have ever been to. The “restaurants” and I use that term loosely, all 2 of them, close at 8 pm, despite the fact that there are flights leaving hours later. This was terminal B. Not sure what terminal A is like but I will make sure to avoid this airport at all costs in the future.",-1

Seems like everybody is taking as much time as they can to delay you. The floors and chairs are abysmal as they are covered in slopped food, and the employees seem to care far more about their cell phones than customer service. Will never be returning to this airport, I would rather drive to Florida from Canada (24 hours) than arrive or depart from this airport.",-1

",False,"  Unpleasant security line experience. We were taking a 6am flight on Sunday and found ourselves in front of a huge line of travelers one hour ahead of the departure time. While it was our problem to not arrive earlier, I approached a mid-aged male staff guiding the traffic, asking if there is an express line for people with less than 30 minutes to departure, so that we can be prepared if we couldn't make it in time. First, upon seeing me approaching, the male staff just turned his back towards me, and I had to address him in the front for him to speak with me, and then instead of pointing me to a panel with waiting time (it was above the security check), he replied ""No, you have to wait in line."" I then asked: ""Do you think I can make it"", he says with such plain tones: ""I don't know, you need to arrive early"". And then he turned his back to me again! It wasn't like there were other people around waiting for his help. Thank goodness that the lady at the entrance (who was super busy) was kind enough to tell us that we can make it and we actually made it. I just think that if you'd like to have tourists coming back, at least be somewhat friendly and stop turning your back!",1
2017-11-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,International airport it is not,True," What an absolute disgrace. Worst airport I have visited in my 49 years. Took 8 hours to travel 6700 km across the Atlantic and took 2 hours to move though 100 m queue at TSA. International airport it is not. Not sure I would call it an airport. Queue was full of tired elderly and children. Took over 2 hours to get through. Nowhere to sit, no air-conditioning, obvious lack of ""Ambassador' staff. Not the first time. Last time took 3 hours. On top of that you are not allowed to use your mobile in Immigration Hall. Can anyone explain why or is that just some stupid rule from the dark ages. People waiting outside to pick me up then became worried when I hadn't come through even though they could see my flight had landed. Orlando receives over 20 million visitors a year. Airport cannot even cope with two planes arriving at the same time. Just returned from India and got through within 30 mins. They have the same procedures at Immigration control. Suggestion: Don't bother flying through MCO. In my opinion it should be shut down. Worse service than a third world country.",-1
2017-11-26,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,it took us forever to clear the immigration,False,  I landed at Orlando International Airport after travelling from Malaysia via Dubai for 27+ hours on an Emirates flight. On arrival we had to wait inside the plane because no immigration officer was available. Imagine waiting inside the plane after travelling 16 hours non stop from Dubai. I was with my 12 month old twins and family. The immigration opened after 1 hour or so and it took us forever to clear the immigration because there were only 2 or 3 officers available. We were holding our babies with their wet diapers in a long line up for immigration clearance. After clearing the immigration we picked up our luggage from the belt. We had around 8 bags and there was no porter service available. Worst part is once we somehow managed to move our carts outside the immigration and baggage pick up we been told that we have to drop our bags at another belt and take the train which will take us to main arrival halls where we had to pick up our luggage again. This is a horrible airport for international travel and I will avoid it at all cost.,-1
2017-11-25,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,1,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,Needs to be updated,False,"  Needs to be updated, only fast food restaurants (not many). One sit down restaurant that was only open for lunch. Bathrooms are too small for a major airport, long lines and not clean. Outdated furniture and not much to do in the terminal. Outside of TSA isn't bad but once you go through there is limited selection of anything. I would not fly into this airport unless I absolutely needed to. With some renovations and upgraded this could be a nice airport but it needs some major work.",-1

We flew in mid afternoon on a Friday, flight on time. We left the aircraft promptly (should be thankful compared to some) but herded like cattle into a room with no air conditioning, all 455 of us from a 747. There we stayed maybe for 45 mins before moving into the main immigration room with only half of the available desks staffed. The ceiling was falling down and the queues took us all directly beneath the fragile looking ceiling panels. There we queued for another 1hr and a half before progressing to baggage reclaim where despite the time taken so far we still had to wait for our bags. Then we had to go upstairs via an escalator (Staff at bottom ensuring we could be crammed on, young families with their suitcases), so dangerous! Signage seemed ok. We also flew out twice, both domestic flights and a further arrival also domestic within the space of a week. The security queues on outbound flights were about 30 mins long but staff were on hand to make the various lines as quick as possible. Of course we didn't have to suffer the immigration queues and that is their problem. There appear to be new self service immigration consoles in place but weren't in use at that time. Otherwise the airport is in good order lots of food outlets and other shops. Being such a large airport taxi times seemed quite long. Orlando you must get your immigration system in order, its appalling and has put us off flying international into your airport. The worst I can ever remember!",-1

One of the lines breaks into multiple lines but you don't know that when you get in the line. I had 200 people who got in line after me get through secuirty before me. The staff are slow. We had 30 people waiting to go through the screener while our bags had already been checked. Then once through security they block people from going to the tram until the other side exits. A totally inefficient system. Expect long lines, a lot of TSA around but extremely slow. They should take a lesson from Atlanta airport. The busiest airport in the world is also one of the most efficient with regards to security.",-1

Planes held 40 minutes before disembarking passengers due to lack of capacity. People waiting over one hour in queue for to speak to immigration officers, 20 minutes queue for X/ray security. Do not take connecting flight through Orlando. There is a high chance that you will miss your connecting flight.",-1
2017-11-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,2.0,you can do better Orlando,False,"  
I had a 2-hour layover in Orlando on October 30th which should have been enough time considering I didn’t have any luggage. The plane landed at 5pm, but due to congestion we were not allowed to disembark until 6pm. Since I knew I wasn’t going to have much time, I downloaded the Mobile Passport App to make immigration faster (I had very good experiences with the App in ATL and JFK). However, when I noted to the staff at immigration that I had submitted mine through Mobile Passport, she rudely said that they ""weren't doing that"". Thankfully the line for US citizens was short and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I followed the signs for connecting flights and had to go through security to get to the main gates, which didn’t take long. Unfortunately, when I got the gates and I checked to screens to confirm my gate number, I noticed that my flight was not posted. I asked a friendly staff in the information kiosk and he informed me that I must be at the wrong terminal and I had to take a shuttle to the correct terminal and get out of the airport and go through TSA again. I panicked since it was 6:15pm and my flight was supposed to start boarding at 6:20pm. I arrived at the correct terminal and spoke with a staff member at the exit and she advised that indeed I would have to go through TSA again. When I told her that my flight had started boarding she said “Yeah, you’re definitely going to miss your flight.” Once I arrived at security check I looked for the TSA pre-check line (which I have) but didn’t see it, so asked the person directing everyone in line and I also mentioned that my flight had already started boarding and he said “You’re probably going to miss your flight but just enter here and ask the staff at the front if you can go in the priority line.” When I arrived at the front of the line before the boarding pass check, I asked the staff member if I could go in the priority line since my flight had started boarding and she said “no, sorry!.” I started panicking, so I asked if the fact that I have TSA Pre-Check made a difference and she said “uhm, TSA pre-check is on the other side” and pointed me to it. I rushed over to the TSA pre-check area and was able to complete the security check in 15 minutes, which compared to everything else in this airport, it was a breeze. Finally, the inefficiency of this airport worked to my advantage and although I arrived 5 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off, there were people still boarding the plane. Moral of the story, I just came believe I had so many staff member telling me that I was going to miss my flight, but none tried to do anything about it. I also don’t understand why the TSA pre-check line is so hidden that not even the staff members know where it is. You can do better Orlando.",-1
2017-10-18,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"can't currently meet the demand""
",False,"  A shambles of an airport. After a long flight from the UK we were told by the apologetic captain that we were being held on the tarmac due to there being no free gates available to disembark. He mentioned how it was ridiculous that an airport of their size wasn't prepared for our arrival. When we finally disembarked an hour later, we entered the worst immigration queues I have ever had the misfortune of standing in. Two and a half hours it took, in a room with no air conditioning. We had a toddler that didn't understand what was going on and almost collapsed in the heat. No one was offering water or seats, just warnings that phones must be kept in pockets. To add insult to injury we had to endure the constant repeating of the flash entry video about how easy they make immigration. It was inhumane how they treated people, coming into their country to spend a lot of money. Eventually we got to baggage claim where our bags had been removed from the belts and deposited anywhere there was room. Then we were greeted with huge queues at the car rental desks. It may sound sensationalist, but it has honestly put me off travelling to Orlando again. The way out wasn't much better. An hour and a half to get through security on the way out. Staff looked like they didn't care and were rude and arrogant. I'm not sure I understand the idea of all the best shops and restaurants being before the security checks either. You can't spend any time browsing as you don't know how long it's going to take to get through. Once you get through security your choice is severely limited. Can I make one suggestion? Spend some money on the infrastructure and staff. You can't currently meet the demand. Your airport is an absolute shambles and I won't be returning.",-1

The staff were unhelpful and impolite, failing to remember we were customers. We ended up with a 5.5 hour delay, partly due to this treatment - it was amusing when the pilot explained that the luggage was being loaded onto the plane by 2 staff as the rest had gone home, which he wanted to do too. The infrastructure here obviously requires some modernisation.",-1

My daughter was stopped for a body search and had her hands swabbed by a very unhelpful member of staff. This upset her a good deal and the procedure was at no time explained to her. When I asked at customer inquiries for a form of contact to make a complaint they were unhelpful and seemed uninterested in my query and unhelpful. Very small and overpriced duty free section.

It was very easy to find our way around as all signs were clearly visible. We didn't have to wait very long in any queue, the staff sent us to a quicker queue. The airport was very clean, but there isn't many shopping stores around. The terminal seating wasn't great, the wifi wasn't great but it does work, just have to wait a bit.",1
2017-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,looks run down and not well kept,False,"  MCO is the worst airpot with the worst TSA agents I have ever dealt with! Arrived at this airport and waited an hour to get our luggage in an area with no AC. Why in the world is this airport not up to date? It looks run down and not well kept at all. The airport only has a total of 3 elevators? People make lines and push each other to get into one elevator. Traveled with my husband and 3 daughters to Orlando, Florida. Our youngest daughter only 2, when flying out of MCO the TSA agent checking our tickets was very rude. He was yelling at my husband asking him to move out of the way with an attitude as my husband assisted me with our 2 year old while I was getting my ID to give to the TSA agent. There was no reason for this agent to act this way! These TSA agents are in need of customer service training. They look very unhappy and have a big attitude problem. TSA agents specifically at this airport if you don't like your job find another simple as that. If you like your job then consider looking at these reviews and improve your attitudes towards travelers! I have traveled into and out of several airports and by far this is the worst location!",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,This is no way to treat people,False,"  
I can only echo the reviews of everyone else here. This is no way to treat people, especially by a country that is supposedly the most advanced in the world. The slick videos they play in arrivals are the complete opposite to the actual experience. The officer we had was actually pleasant but it takes an age to process each group. The most frustrating thing is that most people coming into MCO are there ultimately to spend a lot of money in the local economy so everything should be done to make the entry process as efficient and welcoming as possible. I for one will never fly into MCO again. Finally, a tip for car renters. Having got through customs over two hours after we landed we then faced the biggest queues ever at the car rental desk in terminal B. Literally two or three people on duty to serve a queue of at least 30 and we all know how long we have to spend at the desk as they try and up sell everything. I went and spoke to one of the other car rental agents as I could see another two hour wait on the horizon, initially to see if I could hire something from them for 24 hours to then come back to collect our pre-pay car the next day. She took me over to Terminal A and said queues are usually much less there than in Terminal B. She was right. One person in front of me and a two hour wait avoided. I told a few beleaguered families at the back of the queue in Terminal B on my return. Always pays to be a fox not a sheep. Don't follow the crowd - look for alternatives.",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,this is woefully inadequate,False,"  I travel internationally at least once a month and being that I live in Brevard County, Florida, I always travel through Orlando International Airport. Since October of 2016, each and every single time I have arrived at Orlando International Airport, the flights have been forced to sit on the tarmac or at the gate because the airport’s immigration service is unable to process more travelers. The wait times have typically been between 30 minutes and 60 minutes. When you finally are allowed to arrive in immigration, you will find that the wait times to pass through immigration are very long (unless you have Global Entry, which I have). Be prepared to spend at least 30 – 45 minutes. Once you finally pass through immigration you will enter into the baggage reclaim area. Note that the international baggage claim has only three baggage carousels. Recognizing that this is woefully inadequate, the airport management assigns teams of workers that rearrange and shuffle baggage as it arrives at each carousel. Of course, eventually the carousels become so overwhelmed with baggage that the workers have to remove the bags and start stacking them about the baggage area wherever there is room. Be aware that your bags may be stored on the floor areas along side the carousel. Again, this is not new or temporary. It has been going on without improvement for a very long time. As you’re waiting for your bags – get ready as this can be very long- I experienced times from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. When you finally do get your luggage you will need to head off to the tram that will take you to the main terminal. If it is not working, which does happen, then be prepared to haul your luggage and kin for a half-mile through hot (and maybe rainy) weather. Of course, the airport will tell you that they will provide a bus if this occurs but realize this is not a speedy exercise. The last bit is the on-going renovations inside the main terminal. Currently (mid 2017) the escalators are sporadically available. If you plan to retrieve your vehicle or rental car from the parking area, be prepared. The elevators (3 in total in any one area) will have a load of passengers waiting to move to one of the three levels. When one finally opens for you, the flood gates open. If you are not standing in front of the one that arrives, you probably won’t make it in. The wonderful feature of these elevators is, as people are scrambling to pack into the elevator that just arrived, the remaining elevators will not attempt a pick-up because the last arriving elevator cancels the selection for your floor. You will have to wait for the filling elevator door to completely close before you can attempt to again summons another elevator. Bottom line, if you are arriving from an international flight (especially with a connection) to MCO then give yourself plenty of time (I would say 3 hours), as it will not be a speedy transit time.",-1
2017-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,immigration took well over 1.5hrs,False," What is there good to say about Orlando airport? Nothing. Holiday to Orlando, 'The Magic Place' well let me tell you MCO if there is one thing you're good at is shattering everyone's dreams the minute they land. Everything is slow. Immigration seem to relish in seeing the queue getting larger and asking dumb questions when you finally get to the desk which took well over 1.5hrs. Having kids ask 'are we nearly there yet' and 'why is it taking so long' when you've run out of answers is exasperating. Then picking luggage up and transfering it to the car hire area rather than carrying / pulling it all which took no more than 10mins on foot meant another 1hr wait for the luggage to arrive with 3 other peoples luggage. God help them if they got busy! I've been to better more efficient third world country airports. Being a seasonsed traveller I have to hand it to you for being the worst airport  I've ever had the unfortunate experience to use.",-1

If you can, avoid at all costs. Waited over 1 hour for baggage to arrive, queued for nearly 1 hour for security. Restaurants are all terrible. Pathetic for such a well traveled destination.

We were held on the aircraft for more than an hour because the immigration hall was full. That was followed by another lengthy wait in the queue at immigration and then a wait for one of our cases. By the time we left in our hire car, three hours had passed. The airport knows what that's going to be like every day so they need to step up and improve.",-1

In addition, all classes of travel have the same 3 lines, no point in being a FF, points member, first class, etc, it won't do you any good. Plan on arriving an additional hour beyond what the normal anticipated time to get to the airport is, plus an additional half hour if it is raining (freeway is a disaster). In other words, drive to Tampa or Miami and fly from there! Thank you TSA for making MCO the worst airport in America.",-1

2017-06-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,in total chaos with massive delays,False,"  Avoid this airport at all costs. I travel extensively all over the world, however the last time I had to fly via Orlando MCO was thankfully 2003 as it was pretty dreadful even then! I had the opportunity to visit a friend in Fort Myers and the only flight I could get came into Orlando, so I decided to fly and drive. My flight with Virgin Atlantic came in on time and we were all about to disembark when we were told we had to remain on the plane for an additional 30 minutes due to the fact that 'immigration was so busy'! We all waited patiently, and eventually allowed off the plane, just to join an enormous queue for the passport identification machines. Thinking this would speed things along, I waited a further 20 mins and eventually had my passport scanned and photo taken. We then turned the next corner to discover another snaking queue for the passport security check! After waiting a further 30 minutes, I eventually got in front of the Passport Control Security Officer, who I can honestly say was one of the most rude, acerbic and disrespectful men I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. He basically grilled me for around 10-15 minutes on every aspect of my life professional and personal. I eventually picked up my bag from the carousel, in a room with no air conditioning on day with temperature around 89 degrees, just to discover the necessity to join yet another huge snaking queue to show my documents yet again! This took a further 20 minutes and at this point, people were starting to look seriously unwell, with old people looking faint and babies crying non stop. In total this rigmarole took around 2 hours and all before having to get the shuttle to the other terminal in order to queue yet again to pick up my hire car. Unfortunately, I have to travel through the same airport with my children at the end of June and I can honestly say I am absolutely dreading the experience. Not only will it be even hotter then, but due to holidays I'm sure it will be twice as crowded! If they weren't coping with the volume of passengers in May, I really can't see how they will cope during the annual holidays. On the return flight, the security was yet again in total chaos with massive delays and once I got through this unpleasant part of travelling, there was basically only one restaurant which served table dinning; quite unbelievable for an International Airport. There also appeared to be no flight information whatsoever on the flight departures and the only way to get an update was to go to the actual gate. My advice to anyone with the choice, would be to fly into a neighboring airport, even if it's two hours or more away and just drive. I flew into San Francisco International back in March and the experience, could not have been different. The staff were quick, efficient and extremely polite an helpful. The whole process from leaving the aircraft to leaving the terminal was around 30 mins in total. I can therefore only sum up and say I will make sure everyone I know, avoids Orlando International at all costs. Just don't go there and they will have to review their policies.",-1

2017-05-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,the queues were horrendous,False,"  Arrived at about 5.30pm, Fri 5th May on BA 2039. We had then to wait initially an extended 30 mins on the tarmac as the gate was occupied, then at the gate we were told it would be another hour which again was extended before Immigration would let us off the plane. After we were allowed off the queues were horrendous and even after using the APC machines had to queue to see and be questioned by an immigration official also dealing with non machine authorized people. The best welcome from the immigration officer was to tell me that I wasnt allowed to hold my cell phone in my hand, even after telling him it was turned off, and he said I had to put it in my pocket. He even grilled me as to why I was travelling alone but looked sheepish when I told him my wife died tragically 18 months ago, but he didnt manage to say ""Oh I am sorry to hear that"" as most people do, especially after a 9 hr flight and 3 hour unnecessary delay. Then there was a horrendous queue at Customs making it difficult to get bags off and then to get to the exit. Overall I was delayed 3 and half hours from landing, the only consolation was that talking to Virgin and Lufthansa passenger arriving at roughly the same same said they were delayed 4 hours! Can you imagine the pain for about 2000 people arriving and being delayed by an average of 3 hours. What an awful airport, will never fly to MCO directly again, they just cant cope and don't seem to want to welcome people or to help to reduce the delays. Just get audio messages on the hub trains saying what a modern hi tech and progressive city Orlando is, maybe the authors ought to experience what visitors really experience.",-1
2017-05-01,0.3,Business,1,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,security setup just plain horrendous,False," Orlando airport is generally fine. Decent food options, easy access from city, good signage and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, both the TSA security setup and the TSA staff is just plain horrendous compared to TSA at all other airports I have ever been to. I'm a frequent traveler. 2-4 flights a month is normal, and sometimes it's a lot more than that. I have been to over 30 airports in the country and I've never seen a TSA setup like this. Lines coming from 2 different, opposite terminal entrances running into each other and then being allowed in one at a time. It's quite bizarre especially given the elegant alternative of just splitting the available security lanes into two - one for each terminal. This creates a lot of blockages and inefficiency as each side is temporarily halted while the other side goes on. The TSA staff only adds to this confusion. Not only are the staff incompetent at this airport, as is evident from their mismanagement of the lines, they are also rude, almost all angry, and very loud and unempathetic. I saw people getting yelled at unnecessarily, being made to wait, being given conflicting instructions and just generally having a bad experience over the course of 2 different departures in the same week from this airport. This is not including my own personal experience where it took 3 agents to resolve the security threat of me having a personal flask of water with...water inside. Instead of being allowed to drain it or drink it, I was sent back outside and forced to go through the entire security process again. My only other option was throwing the flask which was a biryhday gift and which I didn't want to forfeit. Overall, this airportms TSA general manager needs to look into the situation. They are turning what could otherwise be quite a decent airport into a terrible one.",-1
2017-04-30,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,so painfully slow,False," I have used Orlando Airport in the past and had forgot what arriving here is like. The past couple of times in Florida I have been to SFB and what a pleasure that small airport is in comparison. On to MCO, we arrived on time from London and taxied to our gate, everyone was getting things sorted to disemabark when we're were told the airport could not handle anymore people. We were kept on the plane for 20 minutes before being allowed to leave and that was just the start of the waiting. Queued for the self service machines to scan passports answer questions etc, you then have to queue to do exactly the same thing with a real person so I don't understand the self service machines use? Having finally cleared security we got our bags only to have to put them on another belt to collect in terminal B belt 29 according to screens. Anyway 3 out of 4 bags arrived on belt 28 despite screens saying 29. By the time I got 4th bag from belt 28 and got up to Avis and collected the car it had been over 3 hours since landing. When I used SFB time from leaving aircraft to driving car away was an hour, that's the reason I stopped using MCO as it is so painfully slow.",-1

Delays in Miami of up to two and a half hours are not uncommon and I suspect this would have been worse had 2 planes landed at the same time as almost all the immigration booths were manned. The system is even more ridiculously convoluted here than in Miami. You join the ESTA queue for the automatic machines, then join an endless immigration queue where you are quizzed on reason for visit, then you queue for a third time to hand over your automatic ESTA slip at customs. Why this could not be done in queue two is a mystery. As I said, we were lucky. Had more than one plane landed, it would have been chaos. These issues with immigration will soon have a serious effect on America, after a ten hour flight these delays will soon cause people to stop visiting.",-1

The staff at the security gates were loud and rude. At least two members were shouting out to the hoards of passengers ordering everyone to 'push your own bags through X-ray, they won't move themselves' and 'this is what happens when you don't put your stuff in the box properly' referring to a mobile phone that had fallen on the floor. Going through X-ray was quite frightening. The guard yelled 'forward!' 'Stop!' 'Legs!' 'Arms up!' at me. It honestly felt like I was at an army boot camp! To cap it all, my 71 year old mum was body searched then asked 'have you got anything to declare, are you carrying drugs?' This left her severely shaken. We will not be returning any time soon!

A woman was placing her bags down to go through the scanner and one of then staff members yells out, ""As you can clearly see, none of this is automatic. You need to PUSH your items down for it to work!"" but a simple ""push your bags down"" would have been sufficient, and less time consuming.

2016-07-28,0.5,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,bags never turn up together,False,"  I visit Orlando International (MCO) quite regularly and overall it is a nice airport but it is spoiled by one long term irritation (bag collection) and a more recent one (TSA related). International Arrivals MCO’s international credentials are irritating. Having collected your bags from the carousel and then gone through customs, unless you are travelling lightly you have to give up your bags for transfer to the main terminal building only to have to retrieve them from yet another carousel. Invariably the bags never turn up together and sometimes the time for them to arrive is excessively long. This airport needs a one-stop international arrivals terminal, collect your bags once and go. Departures security on my last few visits, the TSA have spoiled the party. They seem to think that by penning people together before allowing them to pass through the scanners, they are being efficient. Wrong. All this does is succeed in annoying normally mild mannered people who see that they are being processed out of turn. The first TSA person you encounter does not even check boarding passes in correct sequence. We had about 20 people behind us when 2 females just walked to the front of the line and the guy said they are next. It is no use arguing because they are clearly selectively deaf. Do not get me wrong, there are many very pleasant TSA staff and they have a tough job but the whole TSA management structure at MCO need to be re-trained. Last week they did not have the trays ready for the scanner so told everybody to just pass through with minimal checking. Whilst it made the process quicker becuase I did not have to get my laptop out or take my shoes off, their job is to check people properly. They might feel people constantly bash them but most times they deserve it by being stupid. Orlando airport management need to have words with the TSA before they become as bad as Miami airport.",1
