2019-10-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,5,5,4,5.0,2,2,3.0,4.0,It was just a bazaar experience,True," Bluegrass is an amazing airport that I have flown into and out of numerously with nothing but positive experiences, until this July, 2019. To start, I'll tell what all I like about Bluegrass. Firstly, pickup, drop-off, and parking are almost a joke, they're so easy! Absolutely no hassle, ever. Secondly, the terminal was fairly modern to begin with even before the remodel about a decade ago, and now it's a ""well-flowing,"" well-organized airport (as if it already wasn't). Thirdly, while there are very few shopping and dining options, and they're really only open during peak traffic volume hours, this is to be expected for such a tiny airport, what options are available are of pretty high quality, plus Dunkin' Donuts (at least last time I checked). Fourthly, baggage claim is efficient even by tiny airport standards. (That said, if nothing is open pre-security, there's a piddly little coffee and hot chocolate machine that doesn't seem to work and when it does, it doesn't seem to work right.) Fifth, personnel from airport check-ins to security, to gate agents to store staff, are usually very friendly, attentive and kind, it's like Bluegrass is a sort of big small town. Sadly, however, when I flew out in July, there was an exception to that friendliness. When I flew out, the TSA Pre-Check line was closed, so I had no choice to go through the regular TSA line. Okay, fine, but the guy who checked my driver's license barely even moved his eyes. The officers at the scanner were more pleasant, but still made me take almost everything out of my backpack, thankfully, I didn't have much to take out, but I don't remember having to empty out so many little details from my bag while flying anywhere around the country or world. It was just a bazaar experience. Thankfully, security are still efficient and the gates are only a 2-3 minute walk from security, so I still made my flight in the nick of time, but that particular experience was just aggravating. Overall, Bluegrass is a fine airport that sets the gold standard for what tiny but very functional airports should be, but I sure wish all of its TSA folks understood the concept of Pre-Check.",1
