2023-06-14,0.1,Family Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,pushing everyone through like cattle,False," HORRIBLE Customer service. The TSA lady was so rude over an honest mistake and she’s yelling at me and my daughter. She was so hyper-focused on pushing everyone through like cattle that she sacrificed basic customer service. Yelling, barking at customers, making comments while walking past me without any regard for my response. AND she barked at a fellow co-worker in front of everyone. Really set the whole mood for our trip. Thank you TSA.",-1
2023-01-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,management must be terrible,False, The personnel are rude everywhere-from check in areas to security to everyone except janitorial. The management must be terrible for it to be so pervasive. Very slow day at airport so it’s not overwork issues. Example. At head of security line signs tell you to await next green light. Then agents yell (for 10 minutes I saw) what do you think my arms that long or hurry up-when their lights are red. Which federal rule do you break? Should you be harangued and abused just because you’re politely following signage?,-1
2022-11-28,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,great customer service,True," Upon arriving home after a lovely Thanksgiving trip, I patiently awaited my luggage at the Southwest baggage claim. My bag is very distinct and when it didn't come through, I knew it was elsewhere. I took my baggage claim sticker over to the office and the staff were absolutely wonderful. He kindly assisted me and had a genuine demeanour that reassured me my bag would arrive later. He told me where it was and when it would arrive. Later in the afternoon, he called me right at the time he said he would to alert me of my suitcases arrival. When I went to pick it up, he was so kind and polite to me! I appreciated his enthusiasm and positivity. He is truly a wonderful example of great customer service. I wish all airport staff were as welcoming.",1
