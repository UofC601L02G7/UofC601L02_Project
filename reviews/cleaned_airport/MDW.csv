2024-06-22,0.1,Business,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,park n fly for me next time,True,"  I have been flying in and out of Midway for 30 years. I am writing a review about ground transportation. I have always used Midway's parking for almost every trip made, tonight June 21st is the last time. The nice and considerate bus drivers have been traded in for aggressive, rude tip hustlers who need to handle everyone's bag. I fly frequently and this is 3rd or 4th time with this aggressive behavior by drivers and I'm done with it. On to the park n fly for me next time.",-1
2023-05-19,0.3,Business,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,vending machines do not work!,False,"  How does a modern airport not have shops open when flights are departing? Ever since covid, Midway has been a 3rd-rate airport with almost no options for food. The vending machines (I can attest to this) do not work and every shop doesn’t open until 5 am. Flights are already departing and there is not a single open shop to even buy water. And again, the vending machines don’t operate. My home airport is Austin and a few shops are required  to be open prior to the first flight departing. What is wrong with Midway?",-1
2023-04-29,0.4,Business,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Getting food is a big challenge,True,  I transit this airport 3 times in one month for my business trip. Getting food is a big challenge. I have seen so many restaurants are closed by 7 or 8 pm. even airports and flights are operating till very late. The second time I been to 5 different restaurants and all had bad attitudes. They are out of items. And if you are vegetarian then it's worst. They don't want to help you make anything vegetarian or even salad. Customer service is not good in those restaurants. Airport authorities need to ask those restaurants to open late and have more food.,-1
2022-10-03,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,rude attitude,False, A person at a security checkpoint for TSA pre-check told me that my disabled daughter could not go through because she wasn’t prechecked. I explained I didn’t have time to get that for her as she hasn’t travelled in years. She said too bad she’s over 18 she has to go through the regular line. I explained that she is legally disabled and we can’t be separated. She insisted. That’s the rules. I was annoyed that she was embarrassing my daughter like that. I said I am using a walker because I have severe back pain. I can’t go stand in those lines. That’s why I have a walker. She said just go over there and cut in the line. So we have to walk against the flow of people to another station. We get there and they’re like what are you doing? I pointed to the other agent and said she told me to come over here and I can’t stand in the line. Luckily they didn’t argue. The rude attitude instead of understanding treatment is inexcusable!,-1
2022-09-07,0.3,Business,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Super overpriced items,False,"  Super overpriced items in every kiosk. I know the rule is ""whatever the market will bear, but the prices at this airport are downright ridiculous. Expect LOTS of attitude from the bored, unfriendly staff.",-1
2022-07-27,0.2,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,Midway has gone way downhill,True,"  Awful airport for any type of layover or any restaurant. They tried to “update” Midway a few years back, removing staple restaurants like Harry Carey’s, Potbelly, and even McDonalds. Now, multiple restaurants including Vienna Beef, Cafe Espresso, Bill Goat Tavern, PorkChop, among others, all closed. Weekends and weekdays. Plus, Dunkin’ Donuts, only hot coffee. Zero variety. Employees are angry and overworked. Restaurant Bistro, which replaced a few of the old restaurants is awful. Midway has gone way downhill. Hate it here.",-1
2020-12-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,this place is an operational mess!,False,"  Generally a good airport, but considering the covid, this place is an operational mess! The new security and system for wheelchairs is at a very low level. Customers with ADA accessibility is third-class, they simply are not equipped to handle these travellers. Lines are not clearly marked and wheelchair patrons are left to figure it out on their own. Security is mismanaged, no room for the chair itself. No seating once you get through security to get reset after going through the lines. Additionally, bathrooms are a disaster, no working soap during covid? Who is in charge of operations at Midway, they are not doing the job! No one is cleaning or sanitizing anywhere! Be aware, this management doesn't care, they make it look good in the photos, but actually come here and try to be safe, it's nearly impossible. Why don't the touchless hand sanitizer and towel machines work? Looks like cheap equipment to me, they are either empty or the sensors are poor. Very disappointing and wish Midway would be more serious about being clean, stay away if possible or try O'Hare.",-1
2020-10-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,This place is a complete dump,False,"  What a dump. Cramped seating areas, bad/slow food, narrow concourse, few 'walking' escalators, tiny bathrooms, short runways that necessitate abrupt, rough landings, very few (and ludicrously small) flight update boards - these are just a few bullet points on a lengthy list, which comprehensively and easily condemns Midway as the worst major airport in the United States. This place is a complete dump, and since Southwest essentially owns the joint, the blame lies squarely on their corporate shoulders. A renovation will not fix this mess - it's time to condemn and demolish Midway.",-1
2018-11-04,1.0,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,went above and beyond,False,  I had the best custermer experience at Midway airport. I had just gone through the TSA checkpoint when I realized I had left my work binder at the seating area on the way in. I was panicking and I asked a manager in TSA who took his time to walk me back though security and hunted down where I last saw it. There was a gentleman who told us that he saw another member of security take it to baggage claim. He went above and beyond to find the person who took it there and luckily it was descovered. Him and another member were able to get it back to me and I was in much relief. He was then able to help me get back though security so I could make my flight on time. I have never had such great customer service at any other airport.,1
2018-11-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,a horrible experience,True," As I go through the screening process, the TSA staff are extremely rude. I am the nicest, most patient person you’ll ever meet. However, when my pleasant trip becomes ruined by the screening people it has driven me to write a complaint. It important to give instructions prior to entering the scanner, but they don’t need to berate people. Then scold them for following your instructions but not exactly the way they like. It was a horrible experience and my trip is no longer happy. I don’t want to fly from here again. I would go back home if I could.",-1
2018-03-24,0.6,Business,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,they have definitely gone downhill,False,"  Changes have been made to the restaurants in the food court area and they have definitely gone downhill. The new choices are poor in terms of quality. Seating has always been poor as long as I have been flying through Midway. They lost about 20 tables for general seating as they gave it to a single restaurant for expansion. Most of these were empty when I was there on a Friday night. I go though Midway about 10 times a year, but this was the first time I arrived for departure after 8:30 PM. TSA Precheck was closed! I am so glad I never leave on Sunday as those lines for Security stretch all the way back to the parking garage.",-1
2018-02-23,0.6,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,lines are frequently long,True," Midway is okay. The airport is relatively clean compared to other American airports and the flights are typically on time and departure gates are easy to find. TSA, without Pre, appears to be a disgrace. The lines are frequently long with only one or two employees checking boarding passes. TSA Pre, however, is easy and extremely quick at Midway. Southwest dominates here, so the check-in process is simple and quick. It seems that on arrival checked baggage arrives extremely late without reason. Lastly, the food is below par and the seating is almost non-existent. But still, Midway's accessibility and gateway to the rest of the US makes the airport tolerable.",1

",False,,1
2018-01-26,0.2,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,the seating is almost non existent,False,"  I travel weekly, Midway with no exception has the worse food of any airport in the country, better pack your own food. The selection is poor, the quality is the worst and the seating is almost non existent. Unti 2017 the selection was mediocre, but the new restaurants are horrible, you may believe that they intentionally made every effort to be bad.",-1
2017-12-18,0.4,Business,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,new changes amount to less options,False,"  I travel every week for work and fly in and out of Midway Airport. Earlier this year, Midway airport had some renovations and changed out many of its long time restaurants. These new changes amount to less options, as well as poor food choices. Many of these changes include Home Run Inn pizzas at the court and at both A and B wings. Likewise they allowed Dunkin Donuts coffee at the court and on both wings (where donuts is the worst kind of breakfast option) Many of the pre-packaged foods along the stands were also reduced to less choices and wilted looking lettuces. Overall the food options are heavy carb load choices and do not offer high quality fresh foods and lack variety. Mayor Emmanuel reportedly eats healthy and the airport eateries are not a place that he would be found dining in as a meal. Disappointed that he and the city allowed these changes to be made.",1
2017-12-13,0.6,Business,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"Lines are long for coffee""
",True," 
The restaurant changes here have been terrible. The breakfast and coffee options are minimal at best. Lines are long for coffee. Zero healthy food options overall. Airport itself is easy to navigate. Lines for regular security are usually long, but precheck is generally quick.",1
2017-12-11,0.4,Business,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,used to have efficient TSA,False,"  This airport used to have efficient TSA but now only 2 lines open besides pre, they gave me excuse of shift change. Returned week later and passed area, still long lines with the same amount open. This is all agenda to get people annoyed so they purchase TSA pre for $90. Also there used to be inexpensive food such as McDonald's, Potbelly but now those are gone forcing us to buy $9 hotdogs or $12+ hamburgers. Most places all clone pricing. Also some use signs to block prices unless you get very close to look.",1
2017-10-23,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,the service is slow,False,"  The changes made to the airport are horrible. The food/restaurant choices are horrible and the service is slow. I now get food before going to the airport every time. Also the wait time at security are getting considerably worse, even for TSA-PRE. I went through last week with a friend who didn't have TSA-PRE, and only two scanners were open. It took 35 min for a short line to get processed. This used to be my airport of choice for convenience and my preference for Southwest Airlines. I will start flying from O'Hare if they continue with the decline. Very unhappy customer!",-1
2017-10-23,0.1,Business,1.0,5.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Not a pleasant feeling leaving Chicago,False,"  The mayhem to get through security was very unpleasant. After waiting in the long line that wound back to the CTA, I got around and there was a lady in uniform yelling ""Precheck open"". This encouraged many people to step out of the long line and walk towards what we thought was precheck. Walked all the way in to learn that is was not precheck. Came out and were told to start the line over again. People were unpleasant and mean. I was able to get back in line to then be accosted by people around me. Please work to ensure this doesn't happen to other travelers. Communication will make or break any organization. This could have been certainly prevented by training all personnel on protocol. Not a pleasant feeling leaving Chicago - don't you want visitors leaving in anticipation of returning? Horrible experience!",-1
2017-10-13,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,Terrible terrible restaurants,False,  Terrible terrible restaurants. Their bars are tiny and the service is very slow for food or alcohol. The security line is very unorganized and the TSA people working there couldn’t care less. I’ll fly into O’Hare from this point on and never here again.,-1
2017-10-12,0.2,Business,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,restaurant changes horrible,False," The restaurant changes at Midway have been horrible. The quality, prices, choices and service is extremely poor. This was a poor move by Midway. I used to eat my meal at Midway prior to departure and on arrival. I now make sure and eat ahead as it's not worth it. Home Run in pizza may be good but the rest of the menu isn't good, healthy and the service takes forever.",1
2017-10-09,0.5,Business,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,,,,this restaurant change is a travesty ,False,"  
I have used Midway airport regularly for almost 10 years. The recent change in the available restaurants selection has made it so that I don't eat here anymore. As a frequent flyer who has maintained status for every year of that time, this is a problem. They've removed a convenient, and inexpensive (!) Sandwich restaurant (Potbellys) and replaced it multiple times with a restaurant (Home Run Inn) that costs almost 2x as much for a simple sandwich. On the plus side, the new place appears to have the advantage of being slower also with less professional service. Truth be told, I like Home Run Inn Pizza. It's really good and I recommend you try a slice or two when you're in Chicago. However, pizza is more messy to eat than a sandwich. This is a big concern when you have on the same clothes you are going to attend a business meeting in. I like this airport, it's small, convenient and really easy to get around in. But this restaurant change is a travesty for me and food is a necessity. You've taken the normal routine of mild annoyance that air travel had become and taken it too a much higher level of annoyance. Now, I'm annoyed and hungry. One suggestion, maybe they could install a few more electric plugs. I think these cell phones and computers will catch on.",1
2017-09-07,0.8,Business,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,useless amounts of trash from the food court,False,"  I fly out of midway on a biweekly basis for business. I give this airport a lot of credit for how they keep the security lines moving fast. One area of suggestion is the useless amounts of trash from the food court. The airport boasts being green but the vendors will give you far more trash then you need. An example is, I went to buy a breakfast sandwich at the Greek place in the food court. They wrapped the sandwich in a sort of wax paper and put it in a small brown paper bag and then put it in a larger paper bag and then put in a fork and a knife and a pile of napkins. I told them a few times that I don't need need the fork, knife and extra bag and they can save I for someone else. So what did he do, he threw it in the garbage. Now, I'm not a crazy tree hugger but this happens every time I eat here. I just think Midway should step up its 'reduce waste' initiative. Thanks!",1
2017-09-02,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,,a functional airport with few frills,False,"  As a first-time user, I was satisfied with MDW, both arriving and departing. It is a functional airport with few frills, but it does its job well. The CTA Orange Line provides easy, quick and cheap access to The Loop, another MDW selling-point. TSA pre-check lines were quick, staff courteous too. No complaints about the food offerings before departure: the time passed agreeably in the Windy City Taproom.",1
2017-08-19,0.4,Business,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,food options are nothing but expensive,False," Supposedly Chicago Midway was upgrading the food options at the airport. Upon my arrival I was quite shocked that the new food options are nothing but expensive and are completely not nutritional whatsoever. At least McDonald's had some healthy choices. Home Run Inn pizza and Dunkin' Donuts appear to be the only food options. Considering the trend has been going in the opposite direction relative to healthy food options, obviously these new vendors were chosen based on how much they are paying in rent. Awful!",-1
