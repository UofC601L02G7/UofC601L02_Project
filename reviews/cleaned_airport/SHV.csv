2018-01-05,0.5,Solo Leisure,4,5,3.0,4,2.0,1.0,,4.0,Concourses are dated,True," A small airport - maybe 600 or 700 passengers a day I am guessing. Fifteen flights a day: AA to CLT and DFW. DL to ATL. And UA to DEN and IAH. The plusses: Fast. From drop off to gate in maybe 10 minutes max. Friendly staff, especially at TSA. ""Small town"" helpfulness: had a cell phone left on a plane returned to the check in desk before I got there to ask for lost and found. Nice, new departure hall and baggage claim. Very airy with lots of light. Low cost parking for friends picking me up. The minuses: The airfares! They border on extortionate. Many times cheaper to fly from MIA to Europe than to Shreveport. And UA, AA, and DL always seem to have the exact, same air fare. The local chamber of commerce should work on that. Concourses are dated. Industrial carpeting (remember that?). Looks like they have not been refreshed since the 1980s. Odd / quirky amateur art and movie posters and house plants (maybe a positive?). No discount carriers like Spirit, Jet Blue, Frontier or SWA. No mainline jets, just smallish regional planes.",1
