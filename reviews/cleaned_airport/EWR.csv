2024-09-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,said the wheel chair would be ordered,False,"  I was traveling to Orlando Florida from EWR flight #1213 departing Newark at 2:53pm Sept 16. I was taken to gate C132 via wheel chair, the wheel chair person dropped me off at gate c132 and said the wheel chair would be ordered from the gate to take me to the plane. We asked the gate attendant about the wheel chair she told us she had ordered it. It never came so we again asked to no avail. I finally had to navigate as best as I could, we were boarded last. I asked the flight attendant on the plane about the wheel chair, she checked and told me it was never ordered.",-1
2024-07-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,“This could be a good airport”,False," This could be a good airport, despite the fact it's locked in the middle of an urban area limiting its expansion and infrastructural upgrades. However the worst part is the staff: Rude! and unnecessarily so, immigration officers have a terrible attitude, I was treated like a liar. My identity had to be investigated beyond what is done at the passport control booth, and the way I was told to proceed was humiliating, everything was completed in less than two minutes and I was allowed to got home, the rudeness was a totally unnecessary extra that only eroded the expected professionalism of those officers. I hope someone will notice this problem and require them to take etiquette training. Being rude and nasty is not a synonym of efficiency.",-1
2024-07-07,0.2,Family Leisure,2,2,3.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,Customer service is so rude,False,   Customer service is so rude. I approached a rep asking if where a flight was due to arrive as it was delayed and I was given a stock answer. I tried to clarify the issue i was having and was met with hostility. The agent was dismissive. Instead I was able to get my answer online using the free wifi .. staff very unhelpful.,-1
2024-07-02,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Waited for hours to check in,True,"  Fix your lane system. Waited for hours to check in. Slow service for checking baggage in.  15 minutes per person in the queue. The US and especially Newark Airport has to fix their organizing systems. Shopping was boring,",-1
2024-06-03,0.8,Family Leisure,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,how appreciative I am,False,"   I never thought I would find myself reviewing a TSA department but I felt compelled to after my recent positive experience. My family and I were unexpectedly transiting through Newark on June 2. We had several mishaps happen beyond our control after an extended travel day (>20 hours). The TSA department at Newark airport, in particular a man named Fontaine, helped greatly alleviate our stress and help expedite us through the security line and airport, correcting the mistakes of our airline workers. I cannot begin to tell you how appreciative I am for their help, empathy and services.",1
2024-05-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,TSA employees were by far the worst,True,"  Every person I encountered there was extremely rude, but the the TSA employees were by far the worst. Super rude and disrespectful yelling at customers. Something needs to be done about the unprofessional employees there. I will not return to this airport.",-1
2024-04-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,2,1.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,1.0,"such rude, disrespectful staff",True,"  I have travelled all over the world and have never experienced such rude, disrespectful staff. Bag drop was a joke, 4 ladies stood gossiping but no help whatsoever, felt like i was interupting their night out. No pleases or thank you. Might as well have lept the counter and done their jobs for them. Security was a similar experience. Someone needs to remind these people without us travellers paying exorbitant amounts for international travel they would be unemployed. Please if you are looking to breach US security fly from here, they couldnt care less. Restaurant staff however were a delight. Lots of staff here with God complex!",-1
2024-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,4,2,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,“This airport was an insult”,True," This airport was an insult. A 5-hour layover at Terminal B between two flights was torture. Lounges are closed or under renovation, there are too few restaurants and when I did find a somewhat acceptable spot, at the last available table, ALL healthy options were ""not in stock"". All they had left was overpriced fries with a burger. Spending the whole day here makes you depressed. The worst airport in a long time! I'll avoid EWR in the future and opt for JFK instead.",-1
2024-03-01,0.1,Business,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,“Just awful”,False," Just awful. Bought olive oil at duty free in Spain then I had to leave the terminal on a bus, so then had go through security again where the oil is not allowed so TSA confiscated it. Can’t even travel through New Jersey without a mess. Two hours to transfer planes and can’t take the same things from my connecting flight.",-1
2024-01-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,0.0,,4.0,2.0,"a model of inefficiency"" ",True," Worst major airport in the US and totally deserving of the distinction. Getting in or out of here is a challenge at every turn. I flew in and out of EWR recently and nothing went right. The AirTrain is dreadfully unreliable. On the way in it wasn’t working properly so I had to transfer trains and it took almost a half hour to get to the rail station. If the train into NYC hadn’t been delayed I would have missed it and had to wait even longer. On the way out the airtrain just stopped without explanation for 10-15 minutes leaving everyone trapped inside wondering how long we would be stuck. For $8 each way anyone would expect better for a train that only takes you 2-3 miles. The rest of the airport isn’t any better. On the way in baggage took 45 minutes and was delivered to 2 different carousels despite the boards saying it was only delivered to one. On the way out the security line was an hour. Pre check wasn’t an option, crazy in such a major airport. In short EWR is a model of inefficiency and a masterclass on how to antagonize customers at every turn.",-1
2023-12-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,4,4,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,awful experience through security,False,"  Truly awful experience through security. My shoes did not come through scanner. When I asked where they were, 2 members of staff at belt 13/14 started to laugh, were utterly disrespectfully, just stood around for the best part of 10 minutes ignoring me. When I asked for a supervisor or airport police to attend, they ignored me again saying they didn’t think they would. Eventually they picked my shoes up from under the chair of the person who checks the monitor at the scan and placed them on the belt. Not sure if these staff have been trained or are just complete morons, but if that is how you treat your customers, then Newark is definitely an airport to avoid.",-1
2023-11-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,“completely trashed with dirty grease”,False,"  TSA failed to ensure my beige jacket was properly tucked in the security bin so it fell out and got wrapped around a roller and got completely trashed with dirty grease. This was after one TSA stated to keep my shoes and jacket on since I was TSA Pre. Another TSA told my, last minute I had to take it off.",-1
2023-11-05,0.1,Business,3,5,5.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,“never experienced customer service this poor”,False," The airport is new and looks nice but the people working here are horrible. I've been to airports all over the US, Canada, and South-East Asia and I have never experienced customer service this poor. This is my first time passing through New Jersey and I was worried that this is just how people are in New Jersey. However, after reading some of these reviews and learning that this Newark airport ranks among the worst in the country, I look forward to meeting some real New Jersians. I first observed the staff being unneccesarily confrontational with a man who didn't check a large bag. They waited until he got all the way through the line in security before reprimanding him for not checking his bag as if this large, grown man was an unruly child. Then a security lady procceded to aggressively rush the next woman in line who was travelling with 3 small children. This exchange was unapathetic and useless considering they were already going as fast as any reasonable people would. Then I got to the bag scan security area where the woman gave vague instructions in a dry tone. After i loaded my bag, emptied my pockets, and put everything in the bin she allowed it to pass into the scanner before telling me I also need to take off my shoes. When I loaded these into the bin and put it on the turnstile she pushed it back at me and told me to take my stuff out and let the next passenger load their things, because I ""wasn't listening"". The multiple employees I've encountered in this airport seem to all be angry at something, and its unfortunate that they are taking this out on the customers.",-1
2023-09-15,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,worst airport for customer service,False," Had to catch a connecting flight from Canada home to Edinburgh airport. The worst airport I have ever come across for customer service - the staff are so rude and uncaring, they should move over and let people who actually want to work in customer service do the job! Border control was one of the worst experiences of my life! Only 4 desks open for a turnstile line of roughly 500 people for non USA citizens and 2 open for USA only queue of roughly 100! After queuing for 2 and half hours and very near boarding closure staff then proceeded to open the check-in point we were close to for the small USA only queue only! Answer when we tried to point out we were about to miss our flight was `see your travel rep on the other side.' Finally got through and duty free clear bag also containing my husbands personal belongings got pulled for checking behind 4 other trays, panic stricken I asked if there was anything staff could do for us as boarding closed in 3 minutes and got the response to get in line, staff then chatted away to each other giggling whilst nonchalantly re-checking the pulled trays! In the meantime, I on the other hand felt like I was about to have a heart attack with the the stress! Please put people in these jobs who actually give a damn about other people and don't get off in sneering at their customers!",-1
2023-09-09,0.3,Business,3,4,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,I couldn’t fine one gluten free food,True,"  I couldn’t fine one gluten free food (not snack) option at any terminal! And being stuck here over night due to a cancelled flight leaves you looking for a healthy breakfast, at a minimum a breakfast sandwich! So disappointing. So many other airports are more up on the times.",-1
2023-08-21,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,disgusting treatment and behavior,False,"  
There was a large line for TSA at Terminal B for the 40-47 gates. Coming down the escalator I could hear this loud yelling coming from downstairs. When I made it to the second level, an airport employee wearing a red shirt was nearly chasing people down and berating them for not keeping up with the line, the issue was, they were trying to but when they’d ask her for clarification she would get in their face and tell them to get to the back of the line if they couldn’t keep up. Then, she let 6 people cut in line in front of a patient gentleman and he asked her to please let him get back in his place and she came within inches of his face and began yelling at him saying “Do you want to do the job for me!? You wanna do the job!? Then stay in your place.” And he just simply gave up and sat down. Another employee in a blue shirt walked up to her and couldn’t even calm her down, couldn’t even get a word in. I approached and asked how to get to the TSA Pre Check line and she looked me in the eyes and laughed and then said demeaningly, “You go to the front.” I’ve never traveled through this terminal so I was confused and said “How do I get to the front?” She groaned VERY loudly and then yelled in my face “How do you think!? You walk?!” And continued to yell at me as I began walking and removing myself from the situation, I responded as I turned around already quite distanced from her but she was still yelling at me and said “Ma’am please I did nothing to you.” And she motioned to shoo me away. Multiple people were shaken up and asked if I was okay as well. It was disgusting treatment and behavior. Unfortunately I could not catch her name cause she was conveniently covering her name tag.",-1
2023-08-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,One of the worst airport experiences,True,"  One of the worst airport experiences out there. The redo of Terminal A is not well marked, the TSA pre security line shutdown at 7pm with over 300 people in line. The baggage service delivered 9 bags and then had a 15 minute delay until the remainder of the bags were delivered. Additionally there are several loose floor tiles, broken Sheetrock, dim lighting and general poor aesthetic throughout.",-1
2023-08-06,0.5,Couple Leisure,1,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,assistance is absolutely a joke,False,"  I had requested for wheelchair assistance and on departure, it was all fine. On arrivals, we were seated in the wheel chairs and left sitting for a good 10 mins. Half way to immigration, the man stopped again and told people to use the washroom and he disappeared, leaving us stranded for another 10 minutes. He reappears and wheels us into an immigration line, and what do you know, he completely stranded us. My husband had to wheel me to luggage claim, and had to wheel me separately to the taxi area, whilst he retrieved the luggage. This is the most terrible experience. The assistance is absolutely a joke. We suffered due to their lack of being properly staffed and being professionally on top of their duties.",1
2023-07-31,0.1,Family Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,worst airport experience I have ever had,True,"  Easily the worst airport experience I have ever had, including international airports. Not at all kid-friendly because it's not people-friendly at all. Staff can't get their story straight and are extremely rude, dirty with trash everywhere, and the airport isn't connected. We landed in terminal A and they forced us to leave the airport and go through security again to get to terminal C for our connecting flight. I guess I'm just glad our layover wasn't too short because you need a couple of hours or you'll miss you'll flight. We couldn't get to much food and felt so rushed due to having to go through security again. It would have been better to spend an extra $500 per person to have a layover in another airport. Lesson learned, we won't ever fly through here again. Oh and the so-called kid play areas are dirty, sticky, with broken pieces making it dangerous and the staff do not care at all. Seriously, just watch people and the planes, your kid will be safer and better off. Don't be like me, don't believe anyone who says this is a good airport with kids. Easily the worst part of the entire trip.",-1
2023-07-26,1.0,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,TSA agents are unhelpful,True,"  TSA agents are unhelpful and some rude and unprofessional. I left my phone at security and nobody wanted to help me and were uncaring. At the AA gate they tried to make calls to help. I borrowed a phone to call my own and was so grateful a CLEAR agent, Marquis, answered and personally walked my phone down to me so I would not miss my flight. He was so compassionate and professional - great reason to get CLEAR. I would have been devastated to lose special family pictures and will back up to cloud. He understood it was more than a phone. Rating 10 in appreciation of him and AA counter.",1
2023-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,very poorly managed,False,  This is hands down the worst travel experience I’ve ever had. They have poor staffing and every flight is delayed due to not enough plane cleaners. Staff are unbothered by wait times and have very poor communication with everyone involved. The help desk is always hours long of waiting time with minimal staff. Overall very poorly managed and will never fly here again. Stay away if you value your time and money.,-1
2023-07-16,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,Avoid this airport at all costs,False," Horrible to get to due to ground traffic, missed connecting international flight. Leaving the next day, 3 hour delay while sitting in the plane. NEVER again do I fly here or thru here. Avoid this airport at all costs",-1
2023-07-05,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst airport I've ever been to,False,  Worst airport I've ever been to. Never again. I wont be back. So many issues i wouldnt know where to begin. In my opinion the person running this airport has no connection with the customer. Best of luck. Your going to need every ounce of it.,-1
2023-06-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,4,3,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,I cannot recommend this airport,False,  Absolutely appalling seeing so much chaotic scenes such as several flights cancelled or delayed by over 3 hours during the summer season! This is truly awful seeing the United Club lounge closed early in the morning. How insane is waiting for hours with no lounge access? Absolutely a nuisance and terrible management at EWR. I would avoid this airport in the future. I cannot recommend this airport.,-1
2023-06-01,0.1,Family Leisure,2,2,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,not a good service,False, The security service is horrible! The gentleman at the security check point very aggressively separated my clothes from my electrical equipment on the conveyor belt and threw my iPhone out of the box onto the conveyor belt which is made of metal rolls and now there is a scratch in the camera because of it. It was very unnecessary and not a good service.,-1
2023-05-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,4,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,,"plane to the exit is very, very long",False,"  My wife and I flew into the new terminal A at Newark International airport. We hated it. I am 81 and my wife is 79 and this is not a senior friendly terminal. There are no golf carts or moving platforms. The walk from the plane to the exit is very, very long. Didn't the designers think about seniors? We travel from Florida to Newark airport at least 6 times a year to visit family. The only option for seniors is a wheelchair. We are not ready for wheelchairs and it is totally degrading.",-1
2023-05-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,Security is a mess,False,"  Oh dear thank goodness few airports are like this. It is in the middle of a spaghetti of roads with appalling signage. We drove 25 miles to get across the road to the hotel and on return, much the same to get in to the hotel on the airport. The Marriot hotel signs come and go and are inconsistently located. It has a dinky monorail between the parts of the airport, but no signs that tell you which way the train is going. Check in fine. No clear signage to security. Security is a mess. No thought given to a flow of space to prepare for passing through, as in room to put the trays and remove clothes, signs say to take things out of bags, then staff say to leave them in, then take off shoes and walk on a cold floor. Then no space for the trays to come through and pick up your tray, then no space to take the tray to put your stuff back on. Even most provincial airports are better laid out. Then the most pathetic duty free shopping. I sincerely hope I never need to pass this airport again. I thought Gatwick was bad but this one is the worst.",-1
2023-05-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a terrible service all round,False,"  Newark has to be a contender for the worst airport in the world. We arrived at about 10 pm in the evening, planning to fly out to Belize the next day, and then returned three weeks later with an overnight stay in NYC and a flight home out of JFK. The arrival was a disaster. Customs and Immigration was overburdened with about four agents serving multiple flights. The queue lasted more than an hour and, when we finally got out, the SkyTrain service to other terminals had essentially closed down, running backwards and forwards from stops, with no apparent rhyme or rhythm. There were confused passengers everywhere and the staff on the ground could merely shrug and say this was par for the course. Efforts to get to the bus terminal to catch a coach to our hotel were also stymied by the fact that the SkyTrain was no longer going to that stop and nobody knew how to walk there. In the end, we hiked down a busy road, jumped over a concrete siding and jackrabbited through oncoming cars. Other people found a safer way, but that was purely fortuitous. Our departure to Belize the next day was no better. Horrible queues at check-in, a general lack of understanding and knowledge among ground staff and, when we finally made it to the terminal, nowhere to eat that accepted cash or cards. If you don't have a payment app on your phone, you are not getting fed in Newark. Just a terrible service all round.",-1
2023-05-08,0.6,Business,3,5,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,expect more flexibility and service,False," The airport itself is much improved. It's no longer an empty wasteland. The lines are better than they used to be. TSA is its own thing, so I won't hold that against the airport. That said, the prices at the various restaurants are out of this world. A glass of terrible Sauvignon Blanc is $20. Some bad pizza was another $22. Candidly, I felt mocked for having paid that much for what I got. Having to do everything via QR codes is also annoying. What happened to service? As it happens, the poor staff seemed run off their feet trying to fix people's payment problems. The nice Dutch family next to me had tons of cash - but, no, Newark doesn't take cash. I mean, it's an airport - you expect a little more flexibility and service.",-1
2023-04-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,worst airport I've ever been in,True," We flew in from Brussels to connect with a flight going out to Orlando, both were United Airlines. Had to go through customs after receiving our baggage, they check our baggage. Then gave our bags back again to give to United Airlines. Went through the airport security AGAIN! Walked through the airport only to find out we were outside the back end of the airport, had to wait for a shuttle bus to take us to United Airlines departure area. Once we arrived, we had to go through security again, only to miss our flight by 6 minutes! They need to post times on how long it takes getting from one location of the airport to the other area! Due to the confusion this is the worst airport I've ever been in!",-1
2023-04-17,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Will avoid Newark from here on out,True," Awful airport especially when flying United. Forced to check a bag all the way to baggage claim at final destination instead of checking to pick up at arrival gate. When flyers have chosen to just fly with a carry-on, they need to get in and out of an airport fast. Not only that but finding the rental car area is very confusing and while headed there, we received conflicting directions from airport staff. Will avoid Newark from here on out and will tell everyone I can about how messed up their checking bags at the gate is. Horrible!",-1
2023-03-30,0.1,Family Leisure,2,2,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Horrendous customer service,True," Horrendous customer service at this airport. Eye-rolling, sarcasm and outright laughing at customers asking for directions to the sky train. Given erroneous directions leading to further delays in reaching ground transportation. I’ll never fly into Newark for any reason again.",-1
2023-03-06,0.8,Solo Leisure,4,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,like connecting through Newark,True,"  I really like connecting through Newark. Transit signs are easy to follow. Transportation from one terminal to the next is easy to follow. There are plenty of places to sit down and have something to eat or drink. Yes, it is expensive but so are other airports. Yes, they use the iPads, which I think it awesome as it is so easy to order your food/drinks. Restrooms are clean and there are plenty of them. I found the staff to be very helpful and courteous. The new terminal A is beautiful with lots of natural light and great rest areas to hang out between flights. I have no complaints and have used Newark and United connecting to and from Amsterdam a few times now and will continue to do so without a problem.",1
2023-01-27,0.1,Business,1,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,avoid this airport in the future,True,"  The new terminal A looks nice, but it's not connected to the other terminals. They require multiple busses to transport thousands of passengers between terminals for a simple local connection. It's so idiotic. I'll avoid this airport in the future.",-1
2023-01-22,0.4,Business,5,3,4.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,4.0,horrible and so sad to see iPad's everywhere,False,  Its horrible and so sad to see iPad's everywhere. People looked like robots. No one is talking to each other. TV's everywhere with sound loud at gate C130. I couldn't even have a menu on a paper. Never served because I didn't want to use the iPad. Toilet were not well cleaned. Make people connect together please. Prices on things so expensive.,-1
2023-01-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,Worst airport,True,"  Horrible! United staff was rude, as were the TSA folks. I’m a retired cop, and if I ever treated people like that I would been investigated by Internal Affairs. Worst airport that I have traveled through.",-1
2023-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,will never fly through Newark again,True," We flew into Newark airport as a layover from LAX to Paris. Originally we had a 3 hour layover. The plane was 3 hours late. We had to run through Newark airport from one gate to another in the same terminal. However, when we got to the next set of gates, there was another security checkpoint with a huge line. We have never had to go through security again when switching from one flight to another in the same airport and we have traveled all over the world. There were hundreds of people in line and they were already boarding our flight. Our daughter had flown in from another airport earlier and was on the other side texting us. I asked the airport staff member near me about the line and told her that my plane was boarding. She said all of these people's planes are boarding. The airline would come get me. (Really? When do airlines come get someone out of a security line?) She said I could ask the people in line to go ahead of them. There were hundreds. We went further down in line asking everyone if we could please go ahead. At one point we followed a desperate French girl who was begging her way through. We finally got through and they held our luggage. They ran my husband's carry-on back through the machine. My carry-on just sat there on a table. I asked the staff behind the glass to please help me. Could they please check my bag because my plane was boarding. They ignored me. They ignored my husband. Complete, absolute deafness. We were not being rude. I was really begging in desperation at this point - almost in tears at the stress and frustration of the situation. Nothing. My husband got angry when another staff member came through and the girls hugged and laughed and chatted as they continued to ignore us and our luggage! He yelled saying, ""I know you can hear me! You need to check the luggage and give it to us!"" My husband has traveled all over the world in all sorts of conditions his entire life. He has never gotten like this in an airport, no matter how frustrating things can be. I told him to go on to the gate. One of the staff members finally grabbed my bag and would not speak to me or have eye contact. She was muttering about rude people telling her how to do her job. She swabbed the hand warmers that I had that were still in the original packaging and wanted to know why I had them. ""To keep my hands warm in Europe."" These went through LAX, Paris, Barcelona, Mallorca, and Venice on this trip without one person questioning them! My luggage was never stopped anywhere else. Every person at this airport was rude. I am not exaggerating. We flew back in from Paris 2 weeks later and the signage is not very good. We couldn't tell where to go for ground transportation - hotel shuttles. My husband stopped to ask someone and the staff member just kept yelling at everyone ""Just go through the doors!"" He was very rude to everyone. Once we went through the unlabled doors, there was signage. It would have been helpful before! When we got to the transport trains to go to another terminal to catch the shuttle, the female staff member was yelling at everyone about train directions. This was not just projecting her voice to be heard. She was rude and sarcastic and yelling. The instructions were so complicated and she was so rude that we just left the train area and went to get a taxi. It was worth the money to get out of that airport! We will never fly through Newark again.",-1
2022-12-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,the worst ever airport,False,  Seriously - the worst ever airport. 3rd world countries have better facilities than this joke of an airport. TSA slower by far than a regular line. Terrible infrastructure.,-1
2022-12-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,has to be the worst airport,False,"  This has to be the worst airport in USA. Who design or is in charge of the shuttles systems (to Terminals A and B)? A disastrous way to move people to one place to another. No organization, no help, a rudiments system with employees screaming to people…you name it. Where is the government accountability?  Worst of all: if you tried to submit a complaint it fails. There’s no way (and I tried many times) to get one pass through. To the people in charge, do something.",-1

Transit in the same terminal should not be as complicated and we should not do the processes twice. It is such an inefficient airport. Bad use of human resources. Few water fountains and no place to fill bottes of water. Not enough sitting spaces and places to wait apart blocking the hallway. Do better Newark.,-1

I always go to gate I fly out of to eat because it’s closer. C had lots of options to eat and restaurants. We come to A via the map to see what was there and we had to wait in security all over in a long line! Ridiculous. I have 2 children. I’ve been to a tons of airports this is insane. By the time we go through I may not be able to even feed my kids… just asinine. Will never fly into here again.",-1

Imagine a facility built in the late 70s that was never upgraded to todays travel standards and cannot accommodate basic needs … even bathrooms that went through fairly recent renovations are a disaster and filthy! Avoid! JFK and newly renovated LGA are much better options for NYC.",-1

All I will say is even with the renovations they never fixed the staff problem. Nobody seems to value their job or have a clue what customer service is. I usually don't review but this is more of a warning than complaint. Every-time I am in terminal C and try to use the food court to order something I almost never get my food because it took too long, they forgot, can't even find anyone to ask, or this time completely ignored. I stood there for 30 min when I got a text that my meal was ready and no one even acknowledged me. I finally just gave up and boarded my flight.",-1
2022-10-02,0.2,Family Leisure,3,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,A stressful experience,False," A stressful experience with check-in and security. Both of which I was encountered with two rude staff members.

I don’t usually post reviews.",-1
2022-09-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,3,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Do better Newark,False,"  I will avoid having to do anything through Newark Intl in future. I live in Brooklyn, but rented a car for travel in New Jersey, picking up from Newark International airport (EWR). It is already a painful experience to get to EWR on public transport where there is only one train an hour from Penn Station in Manhattan on Sundays. The last leg to the rental place is the Air Train which literally takes almost 30 minutes to go from one end of the airport to the other and stops for 5 minutes at each terminal and makes multiple delay stops on the tracks. Why? I missed my return train to NYC as a consequence. I saw many other frustrated travelers as well. When raising this with the customer service attendant at the station she basically smirked at me and told me to leave a review on Google. Her complete indifference was infuriating and amplified a general attitude of complacency which makes having anything to do with this airport undesirable. Do better Newark.",-1
2022-09-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,I'm so disgusted by how I was treated,True,"  I have never been treated so rudely by an airport employee for politely trying to ask a question. I'm guessing she treats many people this way but nobody confronts her because they just want to get going. I would probably do the same thing but she and two male employees had just finished boarding a flight to Toronto so when I asked her a question about my gate # she totally snapped at me and I told her ""don't speak to me like that"", she became even ruder and when I asked to speak to a manager nobody would do anything, the two men stood there while she told them not to help me and I asked them are you seriously going to do nothing? They looked at me and I told them how shameful they were. I'm so disgusted by how I was treated. I took her picture, it was gate B-52. Newark airport should be embarrassed and mortified by some of the reviews I'm now reading.",-1
2022-09-20,0.6,Solo Leisure,1,4,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,line for the security check was lengthy,False,"  2 big issues with Newark Airport Terminal C: 1: The line for the security check was lengthy as the airport was busy however they used the qeue to needlessly walk back and forth amongst other travelers even though half of that time there was not a backup so walking back and forth full speed as others passed by at full speed, needlessly exposing passengers to possible covid from others. 2: lets face it the restaurants are all using an inferior system for ordering and paying. Yes having to click on a qr code for a menu has become pretty mainstream during the covid years. However the system is unable to read a credit card. So patrons have to enter their name on the card, the card number, expiration and security code each and every time the patron wishes to order an additional item. Really? the system can not read a credit card, venmo or other? Time to look to replace the system as soon as possible, this is costing you sales as people are walking away.",1
2022-08-23,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,It's elder abuse,False,"  I was appalled, and my husband too. We just could not believe that as tired as we were we could not order a meal or a drink without having to use a screen. The worst was when we witnessed an elderly couple asking if they could see an actual paper menue. The employee rudley told them ""no, it's not available."" The husband tried to pull out his phone from his pocket and I saw how his hand was shaking as if he seemed to have some kind of disorder like Parkinsons. It's elder abuse, we thought.",-1
2022-07-31,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,do as little work as possible,True,"  I requested a wheelchair to take me to the gate. After nearly an hour of waiting (and nearly missing my plane), and repeated requests, and several people now waiting for chairs, two women appear on the horizon pushing empty wheelchairs and walking so slowly they might have been standing still. Finally she pushes me towards the screening area where there are three lines of people waiting to go through. One line has only one person waiting for the agent to approve their ticket/ID to go through screening. She gets on that line but just as the person in front of us goes through (we would be next), she switches lines that has more people in front of us. As that line goes down and we're about to go through, she switches again to a longer line. And now my boarding time is only a few minutes away. I turn to her and ask why are we switching lines? ""Stop yelling at me,"" is her reply (and no, I wasn't yelling). Clearly this woman's goal is to do as little work as possible. Pretty sure that's the goal at Newark Airport as a whole.",-1
2022-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,worst airport I have ever been to,True,"  This is the worst airport I have ever been to. The staff is rude, uncooperative, stupid, and dismissive. I tried to be as pleasant as I could but every single person I spoke with had no idea what was going on and caused massive delays. This was an absolute disaster and I will never come back to this airport again. In 5 different airports in the last 10 days and all of them were amazing except for Newark. It's the worst airport of my life.",-1
2022-06-08,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,1,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,Seating areas are filthy,True,  The terminal signage is absolutely lacking. No indication which terminal you are currently in anywhere. Signage for shuttle transport to alternate terminals is literally barely visible and at knee height. Passengers look up for signage and directions not at knee level. Seating areas are filthy as well. Zoom under the seats of the pic I took attached herein,-1
2022-06-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,The system is an abomination and unjust,False," Who decided to create the ridiculous business model for bars, restaurants and food services? The system is an abomination and unjust both to workers and customers. I will not be flying through Newark as long as this atrocity persists. You have $600 ipads placed everywhere which only give a QR code. It is the only way to way to order food and drinks, but internet cannot keep up with the demand. The internet is spotty at best requiring a crazy amount of time to just place an order. And for those customers who can use it, the system lures them into a false sense of security that their food and drink will be delivered in normal fashion. Yet, I witnessed numerous customers wait more than 30 minutes for drinks, more than 45 minutes for food, and then, without orders ever being delivered, have to fight for reimbursement or lose money due to their flight schedule. We cannot tip for good service and in general customers receive lousy service because workers are forced to contend with a system that fosters anger with both customers and workers. Don't even get me started with plastic being used everywhere, creating more harm for the environment. All of this is a cost-cutting measure to serve the wealthy elite who care nothing local workers. I am appalled at such an horrific system that removes convenience, friendliness and expedience. Those at the top approving this should be fired.",-1
2022-05-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,Really disappointed and won’t be back,True,"  I have just spent a few hours at the airport and am really disappointed at the lack of food, beverage and shopping available. My husband and I had a beer each at one of only two palaces to sit and eat available and it cost us $26? This is an extortionate amount to pay for a beer in a plastic glass.  Shocking to think that an international airport has nothing to buy apart from souvenirs. You can’t even try the perfumes on as there are no testers available. Really disappointed and won’t be back.",-1
2022-05-30,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,,5.0,0.0,,5.0,5.0,Fantastic service!,True," I cannot praise the assistance that my husband and I received at Newark Airport highly enough. The wheelchair was waiting for us when we left the plane and our guide accompanied us to get our luggage, through check in for our next flight, through security and to our lounge without a hitch and with cheerfulness. Fantastic service!",1
2022-05-15,0.2,Business,2,2,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,don't have a clue how to organize,False,"  Check in is a nightmare, self check in seemed to be the only option, no assistance what so ever. Then at bag drop off, the staff were as unfriendly as rude, very disappointed, at security the staff just dont know how to control the influx of passengers, directed from one place to another, everything taken out of bag and put into the boxes, when you ask about passport and docs, get told that you keep them with you only until you have to pass through the scanner then you get told go and put it back in a box. These people don't have a clue how to organize. Being a traveller to various places around the world, Newark will not see me if i can help it.",-1

I hate having to fly out of here.",-1
2022-04-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,Staff super rude,False,"  Horrible experience. Staff super rude, not only with us but also with other passengers simply asking for information. We were all treated so badly. I have travelled the world, and I honestly don’t remember this type of treatment anywhere else. In addition, my husband and I were unable to access to the lounge (despite having a priority pass membership), as we were told that this was only allowed in Terminal B (we were in Terminal C). Finally, our flight was delayed by one hour. If you can choose, please don’t choose this airport.",-1

All these “different” kinds of water are marketing ripoffs. Surely you could manage a perion somewhere in there. One damn bottle. Also not a bag of pretzels. Three hundred kinds of the same thing is not choice. Come on!,-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,took over 1hr to check us in,False,"  This is the worst airport ever! I never had such a terrible experience as I had yesterday. I was flying out for vacation with my family. I arrived at the airport before 5:00am for an 8am flight with united airlines. Due to a lack of staff because of Covid, they took over 1hr to check us in because of a system issue. I had to wait in a long line at customs and when I got to my gate, the gate was closed! They told me that there was a 10am flight that I could possibly get to if I would go to customer service. When I got to customer service, they gave me standby tickets and told me the flight would be delayed until 2pm. I waited all day for them to tell me that the flight was full! I am highly upset, I did not even go on my vacation. They told me to try for another flight for the next day which would be a red eye, but that was completely pointless since my vacation was only 5 days long.",-1
2022-02-20,0.1,Business,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,poorest airport I have ever departed from,True,"  I have flown all over the world, & Newark is simply the poorest airport I have ever departed from. Security was chaotic, understaffed & judging by the equipment, lacked investment. The departure lounge has insufficient seating, no defined queuing areas, is massively overcrowded, has no facilities, is far too hot, & the PA system can't be heard over the noise. In short it is a complete shambles. New York/New Jersey authorities should be utterly ashamed & embarrassed by such a poor, dysfunctional airport. I have experienced far superior airports in countries with GDP's less than that of New York.",-1

I understand working in customer service can be a huge pain but there was no professionalism in anyone until I got on the plane. Also walking through the airport every worker looked like they hate their lives and the airport.,-1
2022-02-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,Avoid this place,True,"  Avoid this place. We had a reasonable 38 minute layover at Terminal 3, with both flights on the same big airline. Newark Facilities couldn't figure out how to connect the terminal ramp to the normal plane, so our deplaning was delayed about 10 minutes. We hustled to the gate of our connecting flight and arrived 8 minutes early. Only to find no one there and the plane gone, while the sign said ""Now Boarding Zone 3"". No announcements about boarding were heard on the fast trot there. Customer Service tells us Newark Facilities (the same clowns that delayed our deplaning) ordered our connecting flight to leave early. Thus between 4.30 to 9.20pm, we were stuck at this place. Good size terminal with many shops, but nowhere to sit down and order a nice dinner from a human and relax. The few shops that sold food, sold the same 12 items or so, at every place. Nothing healthy and nothing gluten free, which we need, just the exact 12 things everywhere. If we wanted to buy chips (potato, Fretos, Doritos, etc.), they had 1000's of options to choose from, but the opposite for every other type of food - it was ridiculous. As a captive market we expect to be gouged at an airport, but this place was by far and away the biggest gouger - triple most airports. $24 for a simple mixed drink, $17 for a small re-made salad or sandwich. No humans to order from, just the same kiosks everywhere, half of which didn't work.",-1
2022-02-02,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,3,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,a nice airport with lots of amenities,False,"  Newark Airport is underrated - if you know what you're doing. To most travelers, EWR is a very confusing airport with lots of (not so great connections) around the airport. However, once you get the hang of things, EWR is a nice airport with lots of amenities. Getting there, parking is very open most of the time, and most of the time you have to either book 24hrs in advance or go to Short Term parking. They accept multiple forms of payment such as EZ-Pass and credit cards (Terminal C accepts Cash). Getting there on train is also convenient from the city as NJTransit operates to Newark every 15-30 minutes from NY Penn Station. The AirTrain could be down occasionally, so make sure you have time to get to the terminal before your flight. About terminals, Terminal C and B have adequate facilities and places to shop. Terminal A however, is being torn down to make way for Terminal 1 in the future. Terminal A is one of the most dated terminals there is, and I would only recommend flying out of it unless you HAVE to (i.e JetBlue, United Express, Air Canada etc.). Security can be very slow at times at Terminal A (especially during busy hours). Terminal B is the international terminal. This terminal is somewhat dated, however, is way better than Terminal A. Customs are relatively quick here, never had an issue getting through. The last terminal (and where most of EWR's travelers go through) is Terminal C. Terminal C is the best terminal at current hands down. United has modernized this terminal to fit the needs of the modern traveler. The TSA process can be from what I experienced to be anywhere from 5-20 minutes, which isn't that bad. Be warned though, prices do get steep here in terms of retail options and dining options. There is very little cheap food options (besides the Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts, or the Starbucks pre-security), so if you want a good meal, be prepared to shell out some extra cash. Getting to any gate at Terminal C is relatively easy, as if you don't need to walk, there's buggies driving around taxing people through crowds to get to gates. (don't forget to tip them!). So in short from this review, if you're going in Newark, if the trip is a couple bucks extra going out of Newark on United in Terminal C, do it. Terminal C will be your greatest for connections, as well as overall amenities.",1
2022-01-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,set up to horribly disappoint,True," It appears that Newark Airport vendors are set up to horribly disappoint, if not anger, all travelers with reasonable expectations surrounding price, customer service, transparency, consistency and quality. Let's start with prices. One expects prices to be higher than normal in an airport but Newark has determined to outdo all other airports and even NFL stadiums in this category. $25 for a gin and tonic, $15 for a breakfast burrito (a marginal one at that) are examples of prices experienced. Convenience store items like snacks are priced similarly, knowing that no one would purchase if the price was visible, you never know the price until you check out. I had the pleasure of ordering breakfast at the Grand Bazaar (fancy name for food court). Order food on the tablet, then you are told to go pay elsewhere. Go to another tablet in a different area and pay (with a horribly convoluted process if you are given food vouchers which obviously won't cover the full price of your meal). You are given the option of ""no receipt"" which most opt for (luckily not I) as when you return to where you ordered your food you are required to present proof of payment. I saw that happen a half dozen times in less than 15 minutes. After waiting a very long time, I asked about my order (having already provided proof of payment when called earlier) and was told she could see my order. Interestingly, a container with my order number was sitting right next to her which I pointed out and they then assembled my order. I have to say, McDonalds breakfast burritos are far superior in taste to the one I got. For starters, it mainly consisted of about 6 eggs worth of unseasoned scrambled eggs with part of a sausage link cut up with a couple of small pieces of bell pepper and onion. It came with a side of cut up potatoes with no options for condiments to add flavor. With a career in retail, I've never seen a misalignment of personnel, product and process as bad as this.",-1
2021-12-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,No enforcement of Covid-19 protocols,True," The worst airport or transit location of any kind I have ever been to period. Unhelpful staff watched idly by as myself and other travelers struggled to figure out directions, signage, procedures and hours on our own. Extremely poor seating, especially pre-check in. Not disability or elderly friendly. TSA entrance was not properly labeled and I waited for 3 hours sitting on the floor in the wrong area, along with 5 other travelers before anyone told us TSA was open in another area. Disabled people, the elderly and families with children were treated terribly and not given proper attention or treatment. There is a horrible disconnect between all airport staff and no one knows anything or are withholding info and making fun of travelers. Bathrooms were not maintained with broken doors and bodily fluids everywhere. No proper security or safety measures. No enforcement of Covid-19 protocols with many, many travelers not wearing masks. Will never be traveling here again.",-1
2021-11-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,Never in my life had I experienced such vile behavior,True," Was only in Newark for transit, had to go through Secondary Passport check just for having a UK passport even after stating I had not been in the UK for over a year. TSA staff in the passport check room were absolutely vile, not to me personally but I had to see how denigrating they were to other passengers, screaming at them, making fun of them to their faces, laughing out loud every time they would deny someone entry to the US as if they got a thrill from it. Never in my life had I experienced such vile behavior, the abuse of power is very clear. Will avoid at all cost ever having to go through Newark Airport again, the experience was honestly traumatizing. There is a special place in hell for the 3 TSA agents I saw that day in the secondary passport check office.",-1

What is in the water there? Dirty, escalators out of service, rude employees, crowded and the ""restaurant"" prices are outrageous. I have seen 3rd world airports where I have been better treated and surrounded by a better atmosphere. What a way to be greeted in the NY area. Someone needs to teach their employees manners and a way to interact with the world that isn't so abrasive and ""I don't care attitude. I was totally disgusted with this experience and will try my hardest to avoid this airport at all costs in the future. Now to be fair, the airline staff do not fall into this category but the local folks that have contact with the public need some real work. Perhaps it is a cultural thing here, regardless it isn't comfortable.",-1

TSA pre paying passengers fair warning, they still make you take your shoes off, empty your backpacks, yell at you in front of your children, remove your belt, and cell phones out of your purses.

TSA lines were terrible! What social distancing in a pandemic, TSA is rude and unprofessional and need to be fired! I had 10 minutes to my next flight and was detained unnecessarily because I spoke up and told them I was late. I was searched in front of everyone as punishment for saying I was going to be late.

The drive in was bad, the TSA employees are rude, and the Security lines are disorganized. Never mind about being TSA approved, it means nothing in this airport. Then there is the walk into the terminal. Federal mandate says you have to wear a mask. They should take a look at the condition of the Filthy common areas. The floors are disgusting, the bathrooms are makeshift bathrooms you would see for the homeless. Nothing is open no lounge no bars. Everyone that works there is either on their phones or just have no intentions of doing anything. Truly a free ride. This place is disgusting. It looks like a Third World holding pen in here.",-1

The worst at everything you can imagine. $30+ for a philly sandwich, ($22+ for a cocktail), re-check through security to travel between terminals, mind numbingly inept and careless employees in security, food or any other service you can imagine.

I was required to wear a mask yet it looked as if the floors and tables hadn’t been cleaned in days. Lots of staff members sitting on their phones. This may be the worst airport terminal I’ve seen thus far.,-1
2021-06-14,0.5,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,terminal has a large number of food offering,True," I arrived in terminal C, which was United's flagship hub. The terminal has a large number of food offerings and was very clean. After I dined, however, I began having issues. My next flight was out of terminal B, which meant I had to use the AirTrain. Unbeknownst to me, I had to clear security again, which had me rushing to my gate. I later found out that I could have taken the shuttle, however, the employees at terminal C never mentioned it. After making my way into terminal B, I had to walk around security multiple times, as it looked as if the checkpoint was closed, even though it was opened. I had just managed to make my flight on time, even after the gate agent told me that I needed to buy a KN95 mask, which Newark sells for 20 dollars. Beware of the mask policies - US airlines allow any cloth mask, but EU airlines demand a medical one. EWR is a great airport for a long connection, especially terminal C. I would not recommend this airport for a short connection, especially if a terminal change is required.",1
2021-06-13,0.1,Business,1,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,possibly the worst airport in the world,False,"  This is possibly the worst airport in the world. Limited food, nothing open, Prices are 2 to 4 times higher than any other airport. No place to get any type of meal I would highly recommend that this airport be bulldozed.",-1
2021-04-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,crammed into this place like an ant hill,False,"  It is impossible for me to conceive how any authority would allow this airport to operate as it does while there's a virus going around. People are crammed into this place like an ant hill everywhere. Checkin lines are out if control. It took us 10 minutes fighting through crowds to get upstairs to the business check-in. Security lines especially after you retrieve your carry on bags from the belt are just plain in your face unsafe. Again, anthill. While thick crowds shuffle through, people sit in the middle of the walkways with masks off because they're at a bar. How is this ok? Avoid.",-1
2020-12-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,unnecessary stressful situation today,True,"  I had an unnecessary stressful situation today at the Newark. I had my bag held for at least 20 minutes because I had a tub of lysol wipes. There was 10 bags ahead of mine, the person checking the bags was by herself doing it. I tried to talk to her that I would miss my flight if I had to wait for all those bags. Her answer I will get to it when I get to it. So after waiting impatiently she finally gets to my bag to only grab my thin tube of lysol wipes and wipe it with something and give me my bag. I had to sprint run to my gate. I mean where do you guys hire such insensitive people? Why do other businesses care about customer service and you don't? Do you offer any training to your employees or do you just take them off the street and put them to work? If you want to be checking bags for unreasonable reason then hire more people and educate them.",-1
2020-11-25,0.3,Family Leisure,1,4,3.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,disorganization and chaos,False,"  We were flying home from a weekend in New Jersey on Sunday, November 15, 2020. We arrived around noon for a 3:00 pm flight on United Airlines. The disorganization and chaos was something out of a movie. Nobody at United knew where to go, the lines were out the door, and the employees seemed lost. Nobody was able to answer questions. One guy (not with us) was yelling out loud for someone from United Airlines to please assist with the chaos. We had my grandsons who are 7 and 5 years old. Thank goodness they were patient because it took us over 100 minutes to check in and check our bags. I have never in all my years experienced anything like it. I had TSA recheck on my boarding pass and the lady acted like she didn’t know where it was. I went through the regular line to avoid more problems. (on another note, I flew home on October 12 from here and the TSA precheck was CLOSED. People were livid! Why do we close that on a busy Sunday?) United Airlines should take most of the blame for this but Newark gets a little also. It was awful! We grabbed a quick bite before the flight and paid $36 for a salad and a small soda.  I certainly hope someone sees this and does something about it. Thank you!",-1
2020-10-03,0.3,Business,2,2,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Dirty Terminal A,False,"  Dirty Terminal A, almost nasty. TSA precheck were bumbling around, fumbling with bags on the belt, standing around chatting with each other and basically not paying attention. True amateur hour.",-1
2020-05-04,0.1,Family Leisure,5,5,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Water vending machines needed,False,"  Water vending machines needed after security.  All stores obviously closed due to COVID. Pass the security only a water fountainis available. Is that hygienic considering the rate at which the virus keeps spreading?  There are 2 vending machines that sell electronics. Please exchange those for a water one! In the meantime, bring an empty bottle of water with you.",1
2020-03-13,0.1,Business,1,1,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,  Worst experience ever. I had a long lay over and wanted to go to a lounge in a different concourse but was unable too. Every time you go to a different concourse you have to go back through security if they let you. They prescribe your tickets and if you are set for a different concourse they block you. I will never go through here again.,-1
2020-03-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,I want to change this policy of separating family,False,  I was travelling with my family for a vacation. This is the first time we encountered the barking dog security check and it was horrible. My son was sniffed by the dog and was asked to step aside by the security as we the rest of the family was standing there. I had to walk beside the barking dog and was asked to come back to the starting place to walk again with the dog. My son was taken by a cop to another scanning area when we the three of the family were standing in another area for checking. Why couldn't they take all of us together when we were travelling together. He was terrified so were the rest of the family. We couldn't see him. After we were checked in the cop brought him to us. My son said he was scared. Please stop this practice. I want to change this policy of separating family for additional checking.,-1
2020-03-07,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,the staff were absolutely awful,True," This airport was horrible. Stopped here for a connecting flight home from London. Most of the staff were absolutely awful. This was only my second time flying and my mother’s first. Staff did not acknowledge us or attempt to help us, when we asked they acted like we were a bother to them. The customs person checking passports and boarding passes snatched my phone from me to scan my boarding pass. The woman in TSA had a major attitude and got mad when we told her that the bins under the table that she said were empty actually had stuff in them. I was in a great mood after my vacation but the staff at this airport ruined it completely. The staff at London Heathrow, Richmond International, Dulles, and Dubai International airports were never rude and disrespectful like this. It’s a shame, honestly, that first and second time travelers, let alone anyone at all, should have to be treated like this and made to feel dumb.",-1
2020-02-17,0.7,Solo Leisure,5,3,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,I'd still rather fly here than to LaGuardia,True,"  I flew into Terminal A and out of Terminal C the next day, both on United Express. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to leave the airport on public transit on the weekend because NJ Transit schedules 3 trains within 15 minutes of each other, then makes you wait 45 minutes for the next one. For that reason, I reluctantly shelled out for a Lyft into New York. I really appreciated that Newark lets you get into Lyft vehicles directly at the curbside - too many airports these days make you walk long distances to a distant parking garage to get your ride, but Newark's customer-friendly decision to let me get picked up at the curb meant that I could be on my way within 10 minutes of arriving, for which I give them high marks. Departing out of Terminal C was a little more hectic, the signage for how to get to security from the check-in desks was inadequate, and the employees who were supposed to be directing traffic were rude when asked for assistance. The food in Terminal C was overpriced, but I thought the quality was actually decent, and I liked the ability to order food on a tablet at the gate and get it delivered. Newark isn't great, and I wish the public transit powers that be would spread the trains out a little more so that there aren't 45 minutes wait for trains. But I'd still rather fly here than to LaGuardia.",1

Terrible systems in place for international travel. Filthy dirty with trash everywhere. Food is very overpriced. I will pay extra to avoid this airport in the future. I've been in a lot of American airports and this is the worst by far.,-1
2019-12-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,"never, ever again use this airport",False,"  I fly the world over and still can’t believe the free market has not eliminated this underperforming airport. Hard to believe there is no dedicated custom for people with connections nor do they have a dedicated security line for connecting flight. I am skipping comments to the airline which was as blatantly not caring or competent. Promised myself to never, ever again use this airport.",-1
2019-12-11,0.3,Solo Leisure,4,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Severe need for an upgrade,False,"  Every time I come here the waiting area is at least 78 degrees, much too hot to wait for an hour for a flight. Searched all areas of the gate area and not one cool spot. Very restricted food and drink availability at the gate area. Only one restaurant one snack bar. If you are hungry eat before you come to this gate. Bathrooms are clean! Severe need for an upgrade. Very out dated and dirty looking terminal.",-1
2019-12-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,disgusted by the experience,True," I am disgusted by the experience my husband and I had at Newark airport this morning. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6am, so we arrived a little after 4am. We breezed through check-in at the Delta counter with zero issues. Everyone was kind, professional, working efficiently, and quickly checked our bags in, printed our boarding passes, and directed us to security. A quick trip up the escalator and we were “greeted” with an enormously, annoyingly excessive long security line. Though the electronic signboard stated the minute-long wait for TSA pre-check, priority boarding, and regular, they informed us all lanes were closed but “regular.” This was was the first major slow down. Next, there was a large number of TSA agents per customers, the majority were dry, cold, and lacked professional courtesy/basic customer service (and some were just straight up rude) as they pushed people through this single lane and barked repetitive reminders about the speed in which to walk past the dog, etc. We are frequent flyers and have seen many other airports use the police dogs much more effectively than Newark. Why can’t they take a page out of JFK’s or DCA’s policy and just keep the line moving at a normal pace and have a lane for the dog to pass everyone? This was the second major slow down. We finally get to our security scan belt around 535am, knowing our flight is already boarding. They switch out TSA people to watch the screen, which stops our line. They yell over and over that nothing may be in a bin except large electronics and edibles. Again, the cold, curt way in which we were spoken to was unacceptable. We finally make it to the scanner and I’m randomly selected for additional screening. That didn’t take as long as I thought it might, but again, I’m now fearful I’m going to miss my flight that takes off in 15 min. No one cares. That was the third slowdown. We get through security to then be yelled at to take our shoes to a bench to put them back on... why can’t anyone show a bit of kindness???? Meanwhile, nearly everyone was passing, in front of or behind, us complaining about how horrible security was today. Why would they not open until 430am knowing people are scheduled to board 6am departing flights at 530? We made our flight but did get to the gate after boarding had already begun. I will be doing everything in my power to avoid the Newark airport for future travel and will tell my friends and family to do the same.",-1
2019-11-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,Terrible service,False," Departed and arrived at this airport for an international flight. Signage is terrible. Services such as restaurants while waiting are extremely limited. But the worst part was upon return getting through border control and customs. Landed early after a 10-hour flight and got in the line for US citizens. There were only 2 agents working. This for a place where planes carrying hundreds of passengers land. After nearly an hour we went past the agents to the machines to scan our passports and answer customs questions, when we had already filled out a form on the plane. We then had to get in another line to see another officer and this line also only had 2 officers working. We were part of a group trip and noticed nobody that had been in line ahead of us or behind us was in this new line. We noticed that no one else in the new line we were in held US Passports. We asked if we were in the right place and were told to stay in line with no explanation as to why. When we finally got to the officer he told us it was bad luck and scanned our passports. Nobody actually ever looked at the customs form. It took us two hours to get through customs and to our baggage. Terrible service. Will never fly through Newark again.",-1
2019-11-25,0.7,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Staff were pleasant and helpful,True, We ended up on a United flight following the collapse of Thomas Cook who we had a flight booked with into JFK. Having travelled into JFK many times before I was comparing my experience in Newark to JFK. On arrival signage was clear and there were no queues for immigration. Only the queue that formed from our plane. Staff were pleasant and helpful in contrast to the rude staff at JFK. Baggage collection was fine and we were out of the airport within 40 minutes from arrival. This was at 12.00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Returning we found the check in quite confusing but we had plenty of help. There was a reasonably long but fast moving security queue and staff were serious but polite. Really liked the food ordering iPads and the free use of iPads in the departure lounge. Really nice feature. The food and drink outlets were very expensive. All in all a good experience and much better than JFK and I’d use United again next time I go back to New York.,1
2019-11-24,0.4,Business,2,3,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,security is always a big drama,True,"  Flew Newark a couple of time for domestic and international flights. It is a descent airport with aged facilities. Queuing for security is always a big drama, which is common for us airports. However Newark is pretty horrible in this regard, especially for international flight. That's why I try to avoid this airport as possible as i can. EWR ranks definitely last among new York airports.",-1
2019-11-23,0.5,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,A very average airport,True," A very average airport in term of quality of infrastructures and cleanliness. Will need to be modernized in the near future. But overall, the biggest problem with this airport (and other in USA) is the people who work there. Many give more attention to consulting their phone during work time rather than offering a quality service to the passengers! The security staff of TSA are unprofessional, not dedicated to their work, rude and not fit to work with people. It gives a strong impression that the main criteria to work for TSA is to be a loser.",-1
2019-11-20,0.1,Business,2,4,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,lines are ridiculous,False," Posted signs and directions are the least useful I have ever seen. No clear direction to rental car, air train, or even what airlines are supported at what gates. Asking airport staff results in attitude. TSA lines are ridiculous, and attitude of TSA staff is horrible. TSA exit provides for only three seats to allow travlers space to re-pack and put on shoes. There is plenty of room for additional seating, just none provided. Restrooms - thought I was in a third world country. Semi permanent outhouse? Complete with queue like TSA? Totally ridiculous. If/when you actually get into one, it is filthy. Terminal - gate area, wide open, good seating, but not one flight monitor. I'm sorry, but if the e-ticket does not provide gate number, and the gate area provides no monitors, you are forced to stand in line to ask at a random gate station about other gate info. Once again - large amount of attitude.",-1
2019-11-06,0.2,Business,3,4,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,airport really is pretty awful,False,"  This airport really is pretty awful. Overcrowded, generally surly staff, not enough restrooms. At least it is generally clean. I arrived from an international destination a few years back and never again. Try finding a Lufthansa code share and connect in Frankfurt or Munich instead. This is a United hub so I connect here occasionally but try to avoid it. Overcrowded and tired United Clubs. I think I will start using LaGuardia once the construction there is complete. It really is pretty bad.",-1
2019-10-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,two hours to clear immigration,False,"  Avoid this airport when flying international and allow at least 3+ hours for changing flights as the queues at immiagration hall were horrendous with so many agents booths unoccupied, surely they know when to put more agents on with the number of international flights arriving. It took me two hours to clear immigration, had a departing flight with United from terminal C so planned to use United shuttle bus at gate 67 which means you don't have to go through security. When i went to recheck my bag in the belt had broken so they were using buses to terminals where you had to carry your baggage onto and as i was now out of the terminal had to clear security again at terminal C causing further delay, i ran to the gate and my flight was just boarding. Staff here are rude and don't answer any questions, signage is very poor and on returning gate signage was wrong sending me the wrong direction for my flight, will avoid this airport again.",-1
2019-10-21,0.7,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,staff were not very nice,False,"  To my surprise, the airport was quite clean and kept in well order. The staff were not very nice for some reason, and I strive to always be nice to everyone that works hard like I see these people doing. I did not get my kindness in return. It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday afternoon, and the lines were alright as well",1
2019-10-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,asked multiple employees to help and nobody did,True," I had a flight today from Newark Airport into Detroit. I got to the airport at 8.45 for a flight that was scheduled to depart at 10.05. I had 3 bags, so I knew I needed to check one of the bags. Most airports let me check a bag at the gate. I have done so at Newark before. The TSA Worker stopped me and asked me to show her my boarding pass before I entered the security line as expected. Than she told me that I had 3 bags and therefore had to go downstairs to check one. I than said that I planned on just checking my bag at the gate. She said ""downstairs"". And I said ""wait can't I check it at the gate"". She said I wasn't allowed through until I went downstairs. So I went downstairs. The staff were very unhelpful and the lines were ridiculous. When I finally checked my bag. I went back up to the security line. The same worker as before was trying to tell me I couldn't have 2 bags and had to check the other (which clearly isn't true, your allowed a personal bag and a carry-on bag). They were both small backpacks so its not like they were big. I think she may have been trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm a freshman in college and look like I don't know what I'm doing. I'll give her the benefit of doubt and say maybe it was miscommunication though as she wasn't clear and kept just saying ""check bags downstairs"" and wouldn't really answer my questions. I then was in the security line. The signs said 15-20 minutes. This was at 9.05, so an hour before my departure time. The line was moving pretty slow, so along the way I asked a couple of workers if they could help me since my flight was pretty soon. They said no, which was understandable considering I still had 30 mins until boarding started, and the lines were only ""15-20 minutes"". At about 9.25 (boarding starts at 9.40, ends at 9.50), I was still pretty far back in the line and it was clear the line wasn't moving. I then again asked the original TSA worker to help me as she was right next to me at this point. She said ""I can't do anything about it. If boarding starts in 10 minutes the gate is already closed."" First off that doesn't even make sense. The gate closes after the boarding ends. Anyway I kept on going through the line, and I was pretty close when it was 9.40 (boarding start). However, the line was going very slowly. I got to the point where you put your bags onto the belt at 9.45, 5 minutes before the gate closes. Since there were so many people putting their bags on their, my bags weren't being moved into the moving line. I asked the worker if she could put my bags in quickly since I had a flight to catch. She just stared at me with a blank stare. A kind man and a woman behind me asked me when my flight boards. I explained that the boarding started 5 minutes ago. They both said that it was ridiculous that they had seen me ask multiple employees to help and nobody did. The 2 people in front of me heard the conversation and let me move in front of them to try to make my flight. I got out of security at 9.48 and sprinted to the gate. When I got there at 9.51, there were 0 employees at the gate, and none at the surrounding gates either. I eventually found an employee at a gate 6 away from mine. He was the most helpful employee of the day. He told me to go to customer service and helped me get a new free ticket for a flight 4 hours later. It turns out that the flight left 10 minutes early and they closed boarding early as well. Terrible service. I'd rate them a 0/10 if possible.",-1
2019-10-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,subjected to music we do not want to hear,False,  The music is so loud and annoying. I tried to watch a movie with noise cancelling headphones on and could not hear it over the music. It also makes it difficult to hear the announcements. Not everyone likes the same music so I don't know why we have to be subjected to music we do not want to hear. I hate to fly out of here but sometimes I am forced to use this airport and I always dread it. Why does the anyone think it's a good idea to create a more chaotic environment. It seems an easy thing to fix. Lower the volume.,-1
2019-10-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,2,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean",True,"  I have never reviewed TSA or any other airport for that matter, but these people are so abusive in their perceived 'power' over the public that it is inconceivable to not give a review. The majority of the TSA staff at Newark are not just rude ... they shouldn't be assisting people in any capacity whatsoever. The initial 'greeter' was a woman that glared and yelled at every one filling up their baskets in the most hostile fashion that people seemed to be cowering. As you moved thru the line she intermittently yelled at older travelers if they moved to slow, or used the wrong kind of basket (although she didn't do anything to replenish the 'correct' ones to her bays) and generally terrorized the guests. It was actually so absurdly over the top that it was humorous at first until you passed thru the scanner and made it to the other side where the remaining 7-10 TSA employees (definitively more TSA employees than in any other airport that I've seen at any one time), loitered and talked amongst themselves and pointedly refused to assist anyone. They would not make eye contact or converse with guests who were trying to catch a flight. If you can avoid Newark airport in general (all Union restaurant and bartenders) ... and of course I had to wait to review because the wifi is so useless...you'll be happier, but that is just the icing on the cake. If you can avoid Newark TSA 'agents' .. lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean. I'd say you've dodged a bullet. I feel like someone should report them to their superiors .. but to have hired those people in mass makes me think whomever is in charge wouldn't care to improve.",-1

Lack of proper signage to tell you where you should go. Worst of all is the rude TSA staff that feel the need to hurl snarky insults to the taxpaying passengers who pay for their salaries. They live up to the stereotype of Newark, New Jersey being called the most unfriendly city in the world. First time to EWR and probably the last. Avoid Newark if you can!",-1
2019-10-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,It is too small to cope,True, I would avoid Newark Airport as much as possible. It is too small to cope. Even many of the washrooms are only portable chemical sheds. The screening lines are long and the supervisors rude. I waited 45 minutes in one line only to be told to move to another due to my hip implant where a full body scan was required. It would have been helpful to have some signs or instruction. Even the Air Canada business class lounge was terrible. My wife and I need to stand for some time before finding a small desk to share with other disgruntle passengers.,-1
2019-10-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,,1.0,1.0,,,,the most ridiculous setup I’ve ever experienced,True," The worst setup for getting food at an airport. Tried to get a quesadilla at Philley Cheesesteak. No signs or indications where to place your order, pay for your order, or where to sit with your food. When asked food service staff they were rude with directing me as if it should be obvious that you pay for your food across the aisle at a separate counter. I placed my order and it took 45 minute to get a quesadilla only after I called the lengthy wait to the staff’s attention. I received a text that my food was ready 1 hour after placing the order. Whoever thought of this concept for food service should be fired. I’ve never written a review for anything before. This experience was so bad. A two hour layover that should have been relaxing was replaced with the rudest food staff I’ve ever encountered and the most ridiculous setup I’ve ever experienced for getting food anywhere.",-1

2019-09-13,0.1,Family Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,TSA here really over extend themselves,True," The TSA here really over extend themselves to make you miss your flight. They wouldn't let go of my mothers insulin at security, almost breaking and ruining her cooler insulin bag and damaging her insulin and making a mess of her two carry ons. They made her stay there for 30 minutes because the staff had never seen a cooler insulin bag like that. Because of TSA ignorance she almost lost her insulin and her flight. Secondly, a United bag drop personnel was making such a big deal about me getting their paper tags that were on top of the counter for passengers to use, saying that I should have asked, so why the heck is it on top of the counter without a sign to ask for it? If we paid for the tickets including luggage we have the right for tags so tags are included and what we paid for.

2019-09-09,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,will do my best to avoid,True," Arriving was ridiculous. I understand there were weather problems, but even Americans were required to speak to a border agent. Had US passengers been granted entry with the machines, then waiting wouldn't have been so bad. In the end, filling the card was useless and the machines served essentially to take your picture and to tell you to report to passport control. It took one hour just to leave the airport. Signage was confusing, border agents weren't very friendly and the layout is illogical. I asked the supervisor, apparently everyone speaks to a border agent. Then why are there machines? Leaving, security was a bit slow. I will do my best to avoid this airport in the future.",-1
2019-09-07,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Coming into immigration was a disaster,False,"  United Airlines arrived on time, and we disembarked in a timely fashion. Coming into immigration was a disaster. First we had to wait in a line to scan our passports and fingerprints, and customs form, we had already filled out a hard copy on the plane, and a picture. Then we had to wait in line over an hour, it wasn't particular full, just not enough windows open. Then we got to the immigration officer, a nice guy, he scanned our passports, which we had already done, he took our finger prints which we had already done, he took our picture which we had already done, and looked over our customs declaration hard copy, which we already had filled out on the first machine. No reason at all to have to wait twice in line for the same thing. After collecting our luggage we had to wait in line again for about 20 minutes just to pass thru the customs officer, only 2 officers were there, before we could exit. It took over two hours from leaving the plane till exiting the airport. That is after a 8 hour flight.",-1
2019-08-18,0.1,Business,1,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,This place is terrible,False,"  This place is terrible, I have traveled through here many times but not for a couple of years, on arrival I had a 3 hour layover but made my connecting flight by 10 minutes due to the lack of staff both at immigration and security for the next flight? The queues were ridiculous, on departure things were no better, 4 hours to spare so decided to gave a meal and a drink, the prices for both are ludicrous, a steak with no accompanying fries or anything was $47 (before we start with the tipping con) a single beer comes in at over $10 and every bar or food outlet has identical pricing ! You have to order through these horrible pads with no cash option (what happened to the states love of the free market here ?) I will endeavour never to use this airport again.c",-1
2019-08-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,airport does not have enough wheelchairs,False,"  Senior Citizens - Expect the worst at Liberty Newark.. I am a 79 year old man. I was traveling with my wife who is 73 years old. Both of us have mobility issues and therefore we had tickets that allowed us to avail wheelchair facility at the airport. (I was traveling from Mumbai in July.) To my utter disappointment, the airport does not have enough wheelchairs. We were made to wait for a significantly long time to get one, when we needed two. I made it known to the airport official that we will not leave unless my wife also gets one. To this, the official was absolutely rude, rude to the point that he made me stand up from the wheelchair that I had and asked me, in a ruder tone, to wait further. Without an ounce of respect for our age, and consideration of our disabilities or the fact that we have been traveling for more than 16+ hours, he left us to our fate. A young attendant after some time finally came to our rescue with another wheelchair which I was given, while my wife walked slowly behind. If the airport cannot take care of senior citizens, particularly from far off places, then the airport is in no position to boast of service quality. Expect the worst when you travel to or from this airport. Having less facilities is understandable, but a rude behavior from officials should simply not be tolerated. The staff need a lot, a lot of training with customer interaction. This is not my first time traveling to a foreign destination. We have travelled to 12 nations of the world. I never expected that my first experience with a US airport would be the worst. I am booking my return ticket from New York.",-1

Wouldent affect the non smokers at all so why cant smokers smoke when they want to smoke here? Our plane was delayed, and we had to buy some food. But at what prices?

2019-07-31,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2 hours to go through immigration,False,"  Crazy situation at Newark after arrival from Heathrow. Hundreds of people came in from various flights but initially only 3 operatives were working. Eventually ( and I mean eventually!!)another 3 desks opened. While I understand the need for security , it was very frustrating to take 2 hours to go through immigration after an 8 hour flight when all it would have taken would have been more operatives being employed who could deal with passengers more efficiently and effectively. On the other hand, on return to the airport to Heathrow, security staff were laughing and joking with children and passengers and shouting out which computer games were the best which seemed to me inappropriate for such an important role. I mentioned a stray case which seemed to have been left. The response was less that concerned! Beware Newark!!",-1

Not to mention unbelievably rigid. Nowhere outside of Newark airport does the TSA so unapologetically take your belongings. For instance, they threw my Nalgene water bottle in the garbage because it had the tiniest amount of water. Face wash that I was allowed to bring on the plane on the last flight was thrown in the garbage. It’s slow, chaotic and unfriendly. What is management doing to these people that they operate at such a low performance level? From the moment you step in the airport your accosted with terrible customer service. This place contributes to NJ’s poor image throughout the country. As an NJ native, it bugs me that we do so poorly.",-1
2019-07-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,1,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,chaotic and poorly designed,False,"  On no level did this airport succeed in providing a satisfying or even acceptable experience. Have had far more pleasant and efficient experiences at airports in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in supposed 'third world countries' than at this abomination. I am a native born American fluent in English, yet there was virtually no signage, unjustified delays, no information, my gate and departure time was changed three times, exceptionally inefficient management of space (inadequate space for TSA and always between gates), filthy and overcrowded bathrooms, an obnoxious and distasteful obligatory system for making an order at a restaurant, pathetically high prices, overworked and insufficient quantity of staff (who were also largely uninterested in being helpful), exceptionally poor connections between terminals. Over an hour for the luggage to make it from the plane to the baggage rotisserie. Then a chaotic and poorly designed means to re-deliver baggage for a connecting flight. There were a good number of plugs and outlets to recharge a laptop of phone. That is literally the only redeeming thing I can say about my four hour misery in this airport. Avoid at all costs. This airport is a travesty and an example of how poorly designed, inefficient, and unpleasant so much of America's infrastructure has become.",-1

I flew in from Barcelona and everything was fine until we got to security going back in. This one TSA agent gave a nasty attitude to every person in line, making a big deal out of putting items in the bin. In terms of food options and shops, the airport is decent. However, I'm giving the airport a low rating solely because of the staff.",-1
2019-07-16,0.2,Family Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,hard to find anything that worked well,False,"  We travelled through this airport for the first time, and having been through many of the airports in the world, this one is on the bottom of the list with NAIA Manila, as well as most African airports. It is hard to believe this airport is in a first world country, as the service and facilities (in Terminal A) are pathetic, to say the least. It is hard to find anything that worked well, and in addition, Terminal A food options are severely limited. Will do everything possible to not use this airport again.",-1
2019-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Really bad airport,False, Rude TSA at check point 40-50. Spirit is the worst airline I have ever used. Canceled my flight and didn’t tell me where my luggage is or give me guidance on how to reschedule. Parking is confusing. Most of the luggage handlers and gate people I have seen barely speak English. Really bad airport.,-1
2019-07-09,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,It was like an oven in the terminal,False,"  Terminal B-1 (gates 40-49) at EWR sucks! I was flying through here to Detroit. The security line was a mess with rude agents and the process took way too long, most of the restaurants in the terminal were closed and the ones that were open were way overpriced, and the terminal had no air conditioning in the middle of July. It was like an oven in the terminal and there was one dingy old fan for ten gates. Also the carpet was dirty and there weren't enough seats. It's like this terminal was made in the 60s for turboprop planes and never redone! Somehow, LaGuardia is significantly better than EWR. Never again.",-1
2019-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,seating is very limited,False,"  Worst airport ever. Got in at 11.00pm after a 9 hour flight and had to get another 5 hour flight 5 hours later, so we needed a place to sit and relax. The seating is very limited. Most airports provide rows of seats, however this airport has replaced the normal seating with large tables with limited seating that is somehow meant for ipad surfing at the tables and there seems to be a charge for this. The few row of seats that still exist are divided by metal arm rests which prevent the overnight waiting folks from stretching out, and definitely prevents mothers from holding babies and children, a very family unfriendly airport. It simply does not accomodate families at all. The alarm at the gate door keeps going off. It has been going for over an hour. What good is an alarm if the staff does not come and investigate. Customs requires a checkin at a kiosk. We tried four kiosks, and none if them actually worked. One man was helping people, and he was nice enough, but he couldn't get them to work either. He said the internet connection was slow and they have problems with this all the time. Really? Fix this! We finally managed to get the 5th kiosk to work, but it took us about 20 minutes. Then there was the line for the agent. Then there was the line for the luggage. Then it spit us back out into the unsecured area and we had to go back through TSA. The food look awful and was horribly overpriced. We waited to purchase something on the plane. We weren't about to buy poor quality overpriced food at this airport. Bathrooms were filthy. The tables with the ipads are filthy underneath. The chairs are bolted to the floor so apparently they can't get in there to clean. The way the seating was arranged is not family friendly. Worst experience ever at an airport.",-1
2019-06-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,security ridiculous,False," I entered International from the Port of Spain heading on to Washington Dulles. I cleared customs, rechecked my baggage on the green route and tried to take a shuttle to Terminal C. it didn't work. I was told to walk by a customer service agent. So I did, and found that I had to go through an entire security line again! By doing so they took three hot sauces from Trinidad I brought back for family and friends. I did not think at any point I'd be going through security again so I had put it in my carry on after buying it at a shop at the gate in POS. I've never had to reroute to security after landing and having a connecting flight. I nearly missed my next flight too. The airport was dirty, the signage confusing or lacking completely, and the security ridiculous. Never again.",-1
2019-06-25,0.1,Business,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,a great airport to avoid,False,"  I got off the jetway of an SAS flight from Stockholm to Newark to Phoenix. That was the last good thing that happened at this airport. All the bad things that happened: 1) Passport Control/Customs: Huge line, took nearly an hour to get through, because half the kiosks were closed or broken and half of the agents booths were unmanned. The staff providing directions were unintelligible most of the time. 2) Baggage check: Signs directing me to transfer my bag after customs were confusing. I ended up in a line for United Air when I needed to be in another terminal. 3) Inter-terminal transportation. Train between terminals was down, and nobody could determine if it would be up any time soon. Worker yelled at people that they could walk, with no other info. 4) Signage - sucks. 5. Walk between terminals was long, over broken sidewalk. Because of that (and #3) I nearly missed my checkin. All in all, a great airport to avoid.",-1
2019-06-25,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,TSA seemed understaffed,False, Started with check-in. My bag was placed on the belt without my bag tag given to the agent. She initially pulled up the wrong travelers to get us checked in. TSA seemed way understaffed and very slow. Nothing was clear about what lines were what. It was very chaotic. Then nothing was open at 10am to eat except for two small coffee shop type places. Green Bean Coffee customer service was awful. The guy at checkout kept checking his phone. The breakfast sandwiches were cold and smoothies were not available but on the menu.,-1
2019-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,airport is dirty and poorly kept up,False,"  To say that Newark is a ""terrible airport"" is a compliment. Any words to describe it are not for publishing was they are so awful and profane. The personnel are not a happy and helpful bunch. They're doing you a favor to be there. You feel that you are imposing on them. The airport is dirty and poorly kept up. The USA is the only country that I know of where luggage trollies are rented. Welcome to the USA. This is not what we are all about. Customs is a joke. They're understaffed, unfriendly and belligerent. The redcoats (non customs officials) herd and yell at you like cattle and remind me of what my grandparents told me when speaking of concentration camps. This is Newark International for better or worse. Mostly for worse.",-1
2019-06-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,a terrible airport,False,  Newark is a terrible airport. From the unfriendliness of all the staff to the small boarding areas with pitiful options for food and beverage at your gate. I will never fly out of here again.,-1
2019-06-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,only gets worse with age,False,  My home airport for over 50 years and only gets worse with age. While they have updated the terminals over the years customer service is poor to non-existent. Recently flew back from Barcelona on Sat. 5/25/19 (holiday weekend) and trying to get through US Customs was not only a nightmare but a national disgrace. At 3pm only two (2) yes that's right 2 were on duty to check through hundreds if not thousand of flyers entering the USA. A near riot nearly broke out due to the people having to wait over 2 hours for no other reason than poor staffing. The agents on duty were slow as sap in January (apparently they deal with this low staffing all the time) and have no sense of urgency in getting folks through customs. I was told this was normal staffing levels. As an American I gotten use to poor service in public transit but it does leave a sour taste with foreigners entering the US for the first.,-1

That's unfair only to the extent that other airports probably don't deserve to be denigrated by even being included in the same category as Newark Liberty. It's dirty, inconvenient, dated and inefficient, staffed by a lot of incompetent and unfriendly people, and the area around it is bleak even for a generally bleak spot like northern New Jersey. They should just flatten this place and route traffic through other places that care about doing a decent job and know how to do it.",-1
2019-05-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,single worst airport,False," The single worst airport I have ever experienced. Nearly 1000 passengers entered customs at about the same time, and there were only two agents to process them. After an hour of waiting, I traipsed all over Terminal B trying to follow instructions for Baggage Control, another security check, getting to Terminal C, etc. Whoever designed the signage for Newark Liberty should be fired. Roughly three hours later I arrived at my gate to discover that they were already boarding a bus, where 50 people were stuffed shoulder to shoulder for about 20 minutes before boarding the plane. In my hours at the airport, only one employee was either kind or helpful. The others I dealt with were unbelievably rude and unhelpful. I am an older woman, and I hope I have never treated a fellow human being the way I was treated. The bottom line: if you can avoid Newark, do so at all costs. I certainly will.",-1
2019-05-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,3.0,0.0,,2.0,2.0,Security set up is not fit for purpose,True," Security set up is not fit for purpose. I waited in line for one hour for security checks. There were only three aisles in operation, one for first class/priority for all international flights from terminal 2. And once through security the gates area is horrible. Restroom facilities aren’t big enough for the number of passengers (just four stalls in the men’s, with the lack of privacy and cleanliness typical of bathroom facilities in the US). Oh, and when I arrived here the other day from London I was stood in line for 2.5 hours at immigration. Just a hopeless and depressing way to enter and leave NYC. It makes London Heathrow seem positively heavenly by comparison!",-1
2019-05-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Newark is an embarrassment,False,"  Well, I can say at the least, Newark is an embarrassment. We arrived at terminal A, and had a connecting flight to Frankfurt, Germany. We had to navigate to terminal B, specifically gate B62. I looked up for the signage, directing me to the appropriate terminal. Terminal B was down a level, and by bus, the signs said we would be arriving. We took the elevator, as we had some carry-on luggage and the stairs looked, precarious. I could quite possibly be over-exaggerating, but we waited at this old elevator for what seemed like a solid 5 minutes, before the door opened. It was like a time warp, back to the 80's inside this elevator. We exited and saw a bus. As I approached the airport worker, I asked her if this bus went to terminal B. Very rudely, she asked me which gate. I told her gate B62. She said that this was not my bus, no bus goes to B62, and that I would have to go back up to terminal A, take a right, and another right and then I could get to terminal B. Confused because of the signs I just read, directing us to this bus, we turned around. Not wanting to wait for the slow elevator, we opted for the stairwell. The stairwell leading back to the terminal, was completely atrocious. Bird wire fencing for walls, trash, dirt and cigarette stench enveloped the narrow and steep stairs. I am not sure if they are even OSHA compliant. There was room for only one direction of travel up and down the stairs. A person walking down would have to stop, mash up against the bird wire fencing and wait for them to pass by. So we take a right and then another right, and we see a sign for terminal B and an arrow, but the ""B"" has been painted over, as if to signify that terminal B was not in the direction we were directed to go! We were basically leaving the airport, by following this rude airport workers' advice. I asked one of the security workers in that hallway if we could get to terminal B this way, and he rambled off on some rude tangent about can't I read the signs? Totally rude and un-helpful. Not wanting to miss our flight by leaving the terminal, we back tracked to the area we began from, in hopes to see another poorly illustrated sign. Luckily a flight attendant was sitting close by, and saw the look of confusion on our faces. She informed us that yes, we were supposed to leave the terminal, take the sky train to terminal B, gate B62. Off we went. When we got off the train, all I could see was a long line of passengers, waiting to get through security. Regrettably, we had to join that line. The line was formed with mis-matching, dated stanchions, crooked and not even wide enough to pull a carry-on through. In the back ground, all I could hear was security officers yelling and belittling passengers for having candy in their bags, over and over again. Publicly shaming these poor foreign passengers, in my country, which I love and have served and protected. I was so embarrassed. Is this how America treats people? First impression is the most important and this was a complete nightmare. Thank goodness my flight to Frankfurt was delayed, because I would not have made it home that day. We got through security and all the passengers at gate B62 were still standing in a long line, waiting to board. The entire airport was dark, dank, out dated and just rude. It was so refreshing to arrive (late) at Frankfurt, where there is order and cleanliness and polite people. Get your crap together, Newark. You are a shameful experience. Never again. Never.",-1
2019-05-14,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,Dingy. Tired. Dated,False,"  As other reviews state, we should be embarrassed. Upon entering terminal B [International Terminal, where one might think we'd showcase our best side], there is woefully poor signage to direct you to you check-in area. Then, after asking 2 airline associates at 2 different areas, we located the SAS counter. Next Security! 1hour, 40 minutes. Nope, not exaggerating. And to add insult to injury, several other passengers in the line stated this was 'the norm'. Frankly, it took less time to drive to the airport from Pennsylvania! Not acceptable. Then into the departure terminal. Dingy. Tired. Dated. Ok, we'll feel better after a bite and a drink. Alas we had exactly 1 choice. Shameful. Could I be more aggravated? Yes I could. 2 bratwurst, 2 draft beer, tip. Go ahead, guess. Nope. OK: $52.00. Incidentally - this is my 14th flight this year, lest you think this is a random complainer. The saddest part is the view this airport gives to our foreign visitors. Yes, I am deeply embarrassed. I see a new terminal is in planning to replace Terminal A. That and B can not happen fast enough. Shame on us.",-1

2019-05-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,for dining were frighteningly limited,False,"  Horrid. There was no seating option before check in, upper and lower decks have been cleared of virtually all seating, not even anything for the elderly. Also, the only indicator for where our checkin would be, Iceland Air, was a tiny logo on a carry-on bag size check stand. At the gate, the options for dining were frighteningly limited. Outlets for charging are limited and taken up quickly as well. I remember EWR being much more gracious 15 years ago. It is rapidly approaching 3rd world standards, with which I am also acquainted. I will endeavor not to travel through Newark again.",-1
2019-05-06,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,3.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,underwhelmed and angry,True," The most despicable way to welcome and greet people to any country if this is how they treat them at immigration. I travelled on an ESTA from the EU with an EU passport. The waiting time was 2.5 hours. There was no apology, no sense of staffing more booths, no facilities for elderly people to take a seat, drink water, use the toilet without losing the position in the lines. We had just come off an 8 hour flight from Heathrow. How on earth does the self proclaimed ""greatest country on earth"", one of the richest nations on our planet think it can treat people like that is completely beyond me. The staff - true to form - treated the situation as a normal everyday occurrence (which is even more concerning). The eventual mini interview was conducted in the standard cold, non-apologetic way. I'm so underwhelmed and angry about how this major airport represents the wonderful American people I got to know.",-1
2019-05-04,0.1,Business,3,4,2.0,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,rude and completely apathetic bossy staff,True," I’ve never encountered more rude and completely apathetic bossy staff as at immigration. Everyone had a withering horrible attitude. They can’t look you in the eye, they say “have a nice day” (or nothing) with the worst deadpan tone that purposely conveys how much they hate their job and you. Their faces could sour milk. Welcome to the US indeed. They treat perfectly polite travellers like we are animals. Also the prices for food are astronomical. Hard to believe anyone would actually shell out that much money for junk food",-1
2019-05-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,airport is a disgrace,True," I flew to Newark from the UK. At immigration the hall was completely full - about 500 people I would guess. I waited two hours to be seen. There were 3 members of border staff and at one point 1 went on a break. I missed my connection and had to fly the next day. The red coats who had the badge “here to help”, when I said I was going to miss my connection said” not my problem honey”. Firstly having so many people queuing for so long is a health and safety issue, hardly a welcome to the US. I fly frequently worldwide and have never experienced such treatment and rudeness by staff supposedly there to help. This airport is a disgrace and management should employ more staff and certainly train them in manners. It is customer service at the end of the day. Also,there are other airports in New York and I will use them in the future.",-1

At the arrival I found extremely long queues at the immigration desk for ETSA (I think we have been standing for about 2 hours after a 9 hours flight from Europe arrived at night). I departed from the terminal B and here I found the same story: incredibly long queues at the check-in and at the security and baggage check. (Fortunately I arrived 4 hours in advance) In addition the guys at the security were really bossy. What to say about the kiosks selling food at the terminal? Actually there were only 3 or 4 selling common junk food for an exaggerated price. There's no shopping area at all at that terminal.

Imagine over 50 people in a line going to one person. Now I have a 5 am flight and been dealing with this line since 3:15 am. It is now 3:53am and I haven’t gone through security yet! There’s no urgency here, 10-15 people at security standing around. Like get it together! It’s going into 2019, there’s no reason it should still take this long especially at this time of day. Hire more people! Make people want to use your airport. Then the staff looks at us with blank stares when we ask them to open more lines or do something so people don’t miss their flights.

After 14 hours on the flight from China, I was waiting for a domestic connection. The waiting areas provide very uncomfortable chairs. The announcements about no smoking and safety were blaring super loud from the speakers every 15 min. Neither the baby nor I could have a nap or rest between flights. The bathrooms are outdated and not that clean (such a shame in comparison with bathrooms in Asia). Few times airport and airlines employees took breaks in the gate areas. They had loud conversations and their radios were loud. Shouldn't they be working instead of disturbing travelers? Doesn't the airport provide break rooms?

The new security procedure is flawed. The person at the front of the line is blocked by bags slowly going into the screening process. So everyone wants to stand at the end and get going. The TSA agents are also rude and don’t help the process. All they do is bark at people. I only fly when absolutely necessary and hope the poor service makes everyone do the same.

The staff were rude beyond belief. I have never been treated or spoken to so badly, the lady who was re-booking us due to a flight cancellation at the BA desk in terminal B did not want to be there and was extremely unpleasant, unprofessional, and giving incorrect information. BA flight 188 to London Heathrow was cancelled due to technical issues and after waiting in line for 3 hours, this kind of experience just makes it worse. After standing in line for hours at 2 am on thanksgiving day she looked at our passports and tells us GO BACK HOME and come tomorrow.

Some people missed their flights because they could not get through the security in time. When they requested TSA officials about their flight timings, they behaved very rudely and didn't expedite their checking. I have traveled in and out of Atlanta's airport 10s of time never faced this issue. In fact, this problem was observed only in Newark Airport.",-1
2018-10-31,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,place is a mess,False," Our departure trip was not terrible, which is about as good as it gets with Newark. We were in terminal C, which is the best of the three. Parking is outrageously expensive. We had TSA pre-check, so the line wasn't too bad through security. All of the restaurants are the same, with the tablets sitting in the middle of the table, so it's pretty hard to have a conversation and share a meal with your travel companions, but still much better than the choices at terminals A and B. The return trip shows how poorly this airport is run. Landing late at night, our baggage came suprisingly quickly, but then we needed to take the tram to get to our car. They only run one train at night between the terminals, and then they force you to get off and get on a different train to get to the parking lots. The first train took much longer and was very crowded. It was worse for the second train. We waited a good 10 minutes as the crowd grew, and very nearly did not get onto the hot crowded car. The pre-pay facility at the parking ramp was in poor repair. It took a long time to figure out where to touch the screen to get the buttons to work, (down about an inch from the buttons themselvs!). There were only two lanes open to exit the ramp, and one of them was blocked by another car who couldn't get the automatic ticket to open the gate. Overall, it took almost an hour from landing to getting out of the airport in my car. This place is a mess, is poorly run, and is unfortunately about the only option we have.",-1

The staff were rude beyond belief and if it were warranted I wouldn’t bother posting a review but it absolutely was not. The girl who was checking us in at the BA desk in terminal B did not want to be there and made no effort to connect with us, grabbed my bag from me as if I were an inconvenience to her, and as a nervous traveller these kind of experiences just make it worse. She was asked by an employee if she was being nice and her response with an eye roll was ‘trying to be’. I encountered very few polite people in this establishment and genuinely do not want to fly to this airport again.

Pretty swift, but know you’ll be waiting in some lines. I went to check a bag that came to be one pound over the limit. The kiosk told me it would be $225. We were rushing, so I paid it. In shock that I just paid that and didn’t even ask questions, we looked around where to go next. A woman working there came up to me and asked if I wanted her to put on my bag ticket. She noticed it said heavy and asked how heavy it was. The staff member immediately took me through lines to get a refund. It was so kind of her to do that for me - it absolutely made my day and started out my vacation on such a more pleasant note. I am extremely grateful for her! Thank you!",1
2018-09-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,worst airport experience in years,False," We traveled through Newark twice in Sept. 2018. Unfortunately, I have to report that this is the worst airport experience in years, and we are world travelers. The worst part of the experience was the awful, terrible, confusing and misleading signage. I would really suggest they hire a consultant to review and drastically improve the signage. There were no maps that I could find in the airport, and I had to ask multiple people, often other travelers, to try to find our way around. The worst was trying to locate the SkyTrain. The small signs appear to have an arrow at the end of them, so we followed those, and ended up nowhere. After asking, we were directed upstairs. Then, I think on the 3rd level, there are conflicting signs, one with an arrow down and another, on the 2nd level, with an arrow up! Again we had to ask where to find it. When we finally got to the station, there was a nice official man, who helped make sure we got oriented to the right train. Even on the way back, we had to ask directions again, because we again got confused by the conflicting directions. All of this could have been avoided with clear maps and well-designed signage. On our return from an international flight, we had the misfortune of having to go through customs and security there. It was ridiculously redundant, I think we had to complete 5 lines before getting out, and it was so slow we almost missed our connection. After completing immigration, we had a very slow and inefficient security clearance before getting on our next flight. It seems more personnel are needed, or else streamlining the process.",-1

Probably 300 of them, including me, foreign passport holders who were directed to one open processing point, while our US friends sailed through their multiple open gates. After an hour in the queue another international plane arrived, probably from China. At this point someone decided to let the international queue go through the US processing gates. If this is what America First means it also may mean less visitors and less of our money. At least the delay meant my bag was waiting for me. Transport from the Airport was good on the train.",-1

It is disgusting, the bathrooms always have huge lines and are gross as is the concourse. My husband and I are TSA approved, the lines are beyond a joke. The TSA agents are rude to put it mildly. I am 51, had a hip replacement 18 months ago, not the average age for this surgery however I get spoken to and treated like I am a moron especially when I line up at the revolving body scanner. It took 20 mins to get through on Sat 8/17/18. Is this seriously the best an airport with mass footfall can do? These people are jobs worth, have no patience and are condescending. Came from Tampa this morning, the experience was so different. Airport is spotless, TSA agents are polite and for the first time ever whilst lining up to go through the body scanner I was asked in a friendly manner if I had metal in my body, it took no time at all to get through.

However it seems that this a common occurrence in this part of the world, at this airport that they are ill prepared for. Terrible communication and service at all levels (bar one woman who helped rebook our flights) which by the way was 2 days later! Seating areas are uncomfortable and sparse. Tired, dirty concourse, hot food left out for hours in the open and very expensive with limited choices. As for baggage reclaim - a total nightmare!

My husband and I arrived to Newark on Thursday July 19, 2018 all was good. On Friday July 20th my 3 kids were coming in. They called us to let us know that they arrived and would be in baggage claim. Coming into the airport we saw terminals A, B and C. They were in C. To get to them with your upper and lower roads was the most craziest thing I have experienced. We kept missing how to get to terminal C going slow and reading the signs. Then trying to get back into the airport it put us out of the way no wehre close to where we were. After 45 minutes circling the airport and almost getting stuck in the parking garage we got to them. Coming back home we flew out of Philadelphia. A piece of cake!

2018-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,extremely poor signage,False,"  One of the worst airports I have transited through. In the past, travelled through here en route to Florida. It seemed ok at the time although just before I boarded my connection I realised my wallet had been stolen. The security staff I contacted, and lost and found personnel were extremely unhelpful. It left a bad impression. I was reluctant to book a flight passing through Newark again, but it has been several years so I thought it may have improved - it is worse. This time around, the customer service aspect has not improved one bit. The airport has three terminals. If you are arriving from outside the US (even if you're not staying), you'll need to clear customs and go through security etc. all again. Also be aware that because there is no ""within airport"" transit area, you need appropriate ESTA to clear customs. There is extremely poor signage for transit passengers. To go between terminals, you hop on the AirTrain which only takes a few minutes. I had plenty of time to kill so explored each of the terminals (pre-security). I would suggest getting your food and drink (if you have time) before checking through security. At terminal A, there is very little beyond the security check point. There are few toilets too, and the terminal is very crowded. So if you can put off checking through to this terminal till you absolutely need to, I would. Terminal C is a lot bigger, and more choices for seating, food and drink but it is also a lot more expensive, even the fast food joints. The cheapest burger place charges about $8 for a burger, another 4-5 bucks for fries, and there was one poor soul making the food for everyone so long waits. I overheard a customer saying ""sorry, I know you're busy, but I've been waiting 45 minutes for a chocolate milkshake"". Both Terminal A and C security check staff were rude, and would not answer people's questions. At terminal C in particular, there are confusing TSA lines ups. Nobody knows where to go, there is no signage. None of the staff will answer a question, just point you towards another area or queue. There is really nowhere to get food/drink at terminal C until you pass security other than a dunkin donuts. If you have time to spare, go along to Terminal B or A, there are a few other choices like Manchu Wok, Subway, Wendy's etc. Given the airport is so busy, there seem to be routine flight delays. Both my flights out of Newark were delayed. If you have a tight schedule, factor in a couple hours just in case. Also pay attention to your gate. The gate for my return flight changed three times within an hour and there was no announcement in the lounge. It just happened that people were looking at their airline App which updated them. If you have a choice, I would not fly through Newark if I could transit through somewhere else. It's a shame as I like flying with the main carrier using Newark (can't name in this post) but the aggro of going through this place again puts me off entirely.",-1
2018-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,,,practically flung my passport at me,True," I’ve landed and departed at Newark a few times in the past eight years and although I don’t like it, this time there was over a half hour delay to get a gate for disembarking, but then arriving at the queue at Passport Control was unbelievable. I counted over 30 desks and only SIX were manned. The wait to get checked was over an hour, and finally when I did manage to get seen, the arrogant Inspector, chewing gum and looking over my shoulder, told me he couldn’t get my fingerprints. When I asked him why, he still didn’t look my way, but told me to try again and press harder on the screen. When this appeared to also fail I asked him what I was supposed to do. He asked if I was wearing hand cream, to which I replied no. When further pressed, he suggested my hands were “too dry”. What utter nonsense. All the latest fancy technology and it required wet or sweaty hands to get fingerprints taken. I told him I had no problems before, to which he just glared at me. I asked if he had any wipes, so I could clean the screen - which seemed to irritate him more. Finally, I took out my own wipes (luckily I had some, or I would have licked each finger - most unhygienic!). I dampened each finger with the wipes, placed them on the screen and bingo! He practically flung my passport at me. I’m 79 yrs of age, travelling alone, and usually am quite tolerant, but Newark airport has the most rude, arrogant, unhelpful staff and since there was no good reason for holding me up, and worrying my waiting family, I will happily never fly into there again.",-1

I traveled through this airport going to Spain. I agree with most of these reviews I have read on this site. I experienced long lines because of unprepared TSA officers, not adequately staffed and listened to their bickering between themselves. The TSA officers were rude and seemed not able to exhibit even the smallest of cordial interaction. As we went through customs some of the police officers also exhibited similar behavior. I understand the need for the security checks but there needs to be some component of decency and civility in the process. I intend on never utilizing this airport again and am embarrassed for foreigners visiting the United States and thinking this is how Americans act. It is clear that the TSA and some of the police officers have no checks on their behavior. A simple lesson of manners would serve them well.",-1

The airport seems to be operating way over capacity as there were under 10 staff checking passports for hundreds if not thousands of passengers. On departure, the security screening areas also seem far too small and you are forced to stand and wait for at least half an hour. The only positive aspect I experienced was the quality of the food in the departure lounge, however it was extremely expensive.",-1

Immigration was beyond a nightmare as it was poorly staffed for the number of passengers needed to get through. Dozens of families lost their connecting flights. Have read previous reviews that also stated inadequacies yet management does nothing to improve. Why? Is upper management too lackadaisical? Send your people to Disney to learn how to move volumes of people. In retrospect I will forever avoid this poorly functioning airport. Shame on management. You all need leadership training also. It is a noted fact that all successful corporate cultures start at the top. It was disgraceful that today on June 9 2018 you had so few people on hand to work.,-1

Its a picture of the security people in charge of checking and verifying baggage ownership, they are supposed to ask to see your claim ticket before you leave the terminal with the bag, but these security members played with their phones, oblivious to people around them, like me taking pictures of them.

I don't accept that the jobs these people do gives them the autonomy to sit and chew gum and roll there eyes at you is if you are thick. On arriving at Newark for departure home it was more of the same, the staff I believe were having competitions to see who could be the least helpful, I have travelled many destinations and airports but this was on another level for complete lack of customer care which had really taken me by surprise. Overall an unpleasant experience which spoilt an excellent trip to NY.",-1

We almost missed the flight despite arriving an hour and thirty minutes before. We did not stop for food, just five minutes each in the bathroom. We made our flight by the grace of God and the kind people ahead of us in line, allowed us to past them. The TSA agents were so rude, it was actually like a game of let’s see who can be the rudest. They were unhelpful, unorganized and extremely unpleasant. This airport is so confusing. I mean no one knows what they’re doing or how to get to their gates and that is because nobody wants to do their job. Please avoid this airport at all costs.

Then made me do public pat down and ripped through my luggage which took another 30 min. Almost missed my flight...because I renewed my driver lic. In last 7 days! It had not expired.

This was by far the worst experience either one of us had of an airport. Both being in our 30s, we have travelled a fair share and seen different kind of airports in different countries, but this was shocking! Our carrier (SAS) informed us to be at Newark airport approx. 1,5-2 hours before departure. But since the weather was a bit off in N.Y.C, we decided to go out to the airport almost 3 hours before departure at 11.30 pm in the evening. As luck would have it! The airport is extremely disorganized, with few signs pointing you in the right direction and not even informative calling in the loudspeakers. Instead, airport staff were going around yelling and shouting seemingly important info, such as that some passengers had to go ahead in line or were missing. Absolutely shocking. The security process itself was also a joke, and very, very time consuming. We stood in line for our security check 1 hour and 45 minutes. The procedure was very shattered and whimsical, and the staff was borderlining on being rude, screaming in peoples faces to remove their shoes. Why not put up a bunch of signs in different languages that explains the security process instead, so people can read and understand while standing in line? That would save both time and frustration. Not all security checks are the same either. All in all, being spoiled by the efficent security and customs in Copenhagen and Amsterdam, it was a nightmare going through Newark airport. There's certainly room for some massive improvements, and hopefully, improvements and effiency are on the top of the list of what to do next at Newark airport. The best advice we can give you, is to be at the airport with very wide time margins. It takes longer than you think (almost forever) and it's not an uncomplicated system. At least for departures, in this regard.",-1

The staff were okay and decently nice. After check-in, I was amazed at all of the shops and food options and had a great time waiting for my next flight. When I came home from Japan though, it was a completely different experience. The staff were incredibly rude and obnoxious. I was a little confused where I was going and asked an employee for help, she was annoyed that I was confused and yelled directions at me. The other employees were just as rude and the overall atmosphere was unpleasant. Employees wouldn't look people in the eyes, they were on their phones, and leaning on walls/objects lazily. The staff at TSA were horrible, screaming directions at people and were just rude in general. I never experienced such rudeness from TSA/other staff at any other airport I've been to. If you have an option to go/connect to another airport, please do! Also, the WIFI was really bad and I had a hard time connecting to it on 2 different phones.",-1
2018-05-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,they are no longer serving food,True,"  I am used to UK airports standard, with plenty of choices to eat, and mall-style shopping. However, when you are at a Newark Airport restaurant early evening with 2 hours to spare and told that at 8.30pm they are no longer serving food, and that the only other restaurant in the airport serves food in plastic plates (at $15 for a burger and kettle crisps), you will be let down, no matter what your standards are. I was travelling from Newark terminal B. The queue for security was also appalling, the staff came across as disorganised and did not direct passengers properly so there was a long delay. To add to the bad experience, taxis to Newark from Manhattan do not have a fixed fee so if you are stuck in traffic for 1 hour you could end up paying easily double the usual fare, I would recommend the train to and from Penn Station to Newark airport if you are travelling light, guaranteed price and more reliable than getting stuck in the Holland tunnel during rush hour in a taxi. America, you need to sort out your airports and keep your restaurants open until the last flights of the day and start adding shops, you have a captive audience there, so it's no brainer! Also start adding signs for directions, i.e. signs for departure. I will fly from JFK next time hoping it is better!",-1

",False,"  The gates at this airport need to be renovated, there was trash and it was dirty. The seats at the gates were falling apart and were very old. The seats did not have chargers for your phone, if you wanted to charge your phone you would have to walk to white tables near restaurants that had chargers. So if you wanted to charge your phone you could not do it at the gate were your plane would take off. I spent a long time looking for a map/directory that displayed restaurants and shops, and I never found it. I visited places to eat and found that the prices are ridiculous for what you are getting. The Wifi Connectivity was really poor, it would suddenly cut on and off at times. The ratio of passengers to staff is awful. It took me 30 minutes to get halfway through the travel assistance line. There was only 2 airline staff for so many people that needed assistance, which made the lines so slow. They need to hire more staff.",-1

I had a six hour layover and it was one of the worst airport experiences of my life. My first thought was the general filth of the place. Staff were rude and unhelpful. The queues were massive and poorly laid out so that they blocked other traffic. Amenities are very limited beyond security. I had a gate change that was not announced. While I was in the toilet two airport workers came in bantering with each other with 'threats' and foul language which I at first thought was intended for me. The chairs were terribly uncomfortable making any rest impossible. In the future I will pay extra for tickets to avoid Newark.,-1

However it continuously stikes me how bad Newark Airport is at handling security and basic customer service. The lines are up to an hour long and while some of the staff is trying to keep the mood up the term customer service is not something most staff has encountered. Traveling from Terminal A it is the same whether in priority line or not. Go on a study tour abroad and see how others handle it. Get some logistic experts to help you out.

No surprise. Get rid of Ruby Tuesdays, and find someone to run a restaurant with somewhast decent service and food. This is not high brow. I typically wait 25 minutes before anyone even shows up to take my order. Terminal A. ""A"" Third World terminal. (And, I have been to many 3rd world airports.

I just stood through an hour and thirty minute wait on a security ""training day"" (which is somehow happening every single time that I fly through this airport, I have never gotten through security in less than 30 minutes in 3 visits). Many of the passengers on our flight had finally reached the front of the line and were now having our names called out on the intercom. Clearly frustrated by now being on track to miss our flight after arriving hours before our flight, we began pleading with TSA to please hurry up the process as we were going to miss our flights despite being at the airport hours in advance. The TSA woman who was clearly in charge got into a verbal argument with another passenger (not joking), while displaying tremendous attitude, disrespect, and a fundamental lack of empathy. She then ordered a shift change to make a point or spite us or something, further delaying us 10 minutes. There is no standard of professionalism or kindness. Avoid like the plague. Worst airport in the United States.",-1

Horrendous design, tired and outdated, with dirty restrooms and an appalling restaurant at gate B54. Disappointed not to be told that the 'best' food options were landside, and I did not know that we would not be able to visit any outlets at any other B gate areas once through security. Security queue was slow. I was told iPads did not have to come out of bags (not the same in other global airports). Then I saw a bag being pulled aside from the X-Ray because there was an iPad inside it! TSA agent shouting at a passenger whose tray was being searched, because he was trying to help organise things in the tray to make them easier to inspect. The passenger was forcibly told to get back, then the TSA agent flicked his hands at the man. There's a real problem here with people having some bizarre personal space issues, like every person is out to get them (note - we normal passengers are not out to get you). Food at gate B54 was there worst I have ever seen, anywhere, ever. $14 for 5 dried out chicken nuggets and $9.99 for a beer. The Unusual Times 'restaurant' should be ashamed to even open. Apparently I was the first person today to complain. If it is, people here are far too polite and should rebel at such awful food! Last of all, toilet floors dirty, one sink blocked off, the other one not even stuck down to the shelf, when I pushed the faucet to turn on the water, the whole sink moved. First time into EWR, hopefully my last.",-1

When flying back on my return trip I was asking which baggage claim area to go to and all I was told was to go downstairs. Most TSA agents and customer service representative would not help me at all, if it wasn’t for some young man working on the escalators I would have never found my baggage.

This is approximately 20 hours of economy class comfort and Newark was my connection to RDU (Raleigh-Durham). It was also my third security gate passage in that 20 hour span and I had been mostly without sleep for the last 24 hours upon arrival at Newark. Overall, I found the security gate staff at Newark to be among the rudest and worst-behaved non-professionals in my limited flying experience as a passenger. They bark orders like you're in boot camp, and do not allow passengers ample organization time to move through the gate. I was carrying laptop computer and other carry-on bag, and did not wish to separate too far from them while moving through the gate. I was tired, slightly confused and forgot to place my smartphone in my personal items bin. They made a big deal about my forgetting to do this, and I commented back to them about their rudeness. A supervisor was immediately called by staff to investigate me further. I was then subjected to a full body pat-down, including full touching of my midsection. While being subjected to the full pat down, two more times the supervisor was called by staff to further inspect me. Only when I offered a verbal apology to TSA staff for negative comments made about their behavior and lack of common courtesy was I allowed to proceed through the gate. With the exception of the supervisor, who clearly could find no visible violations in my passage, I found all the staff completely lacking in professionalism and common courtesy, and feel they actually went out of their way to make my passage through the gate even more difficult when I responded to their negative and aggressive behavior. On whole, this was the dirtiest, most disgusting aiport I've encountered. The floors are dirty, the restrooms not particularly clean, the staff are rude. I will do my best to avoid ever connecting here again.",-1

Many people with small kids and connecting flights with no updates from either Icelandair or Airport employees. Icelandair said it was a carousel issue but no one thought of switching us to the many carousels that were open. When I asked Airport employees for assistance and a Manager, I was shrugged off and told no manager was available.

I bought a through ticket from Penn Station on New Jersey Transit and made the connection at the Newark Airport Station on to the Air Train which connects the terminals. I was using Terminal C, a hub for United. Although it was crowded, the security line moved smoothly. The terminal does not have enough ""lower end"" food services. Seating space is also insufficient. Besides the gate was a separate enclosed section for travelers to be security checked again. This was for travelers to Israel. The checks were unobtrusive and the movement of people were well controlled. On returning back to Newark, although I used the automatic machines to get my passport read, we had to wait in line to have the passport the computer print out examined by an immigration officer. It was a 15 minute wait primarily because only four agents were on duty. The officer was pleasant and wished me in that most wonderful of ways - Welcome back! With that I was in the baggage hall and followed the Exit signs out to the Air Train. At the conclusion of the Air Train ride, you buy the ticket for New Jersey Transit to go to Penn Station. Train staff are there to help you. The C Terminal is big and one has to focus on the signs to ensure avoiding getting lost It was not a hassle to use this airport.",1

2017-12-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TSA staff here are terrible,False," The TSA staff here are terrible - the worst of any I have ever experienced. It's not a security line at Newark if the TSA ""agents"" aren't sighing, rolling their eyes, and mocking and yelling at passengers (when we are unfortunate enough to attract their attention. Otherwise they just yell at each other). Recently, they seem to be on some kind of security kick. I have been randomly selected for a security check, or my bag selected for further inspection every time. Now, actual safety and security are great, but what we're getting are pat downs and suitcase inspections where they spill your belongings all over the floor. The security lines are slow and cramped, with limited space to unpack all your liquids/electronics. Another TSA agent specialty is just as you near the front of your line, they will usher you into a different line. I know it doesn't make sense. You have to see it to believe it, but I hope you don't see it. If you fly out of Terminal A in the morning, you get a lovely view of the sunrise over Manhattan. This helps me remember that there is some beauty and joy in our world when all around is darkness. (Look, I get it's not a nice job, worse than the service jobs I've worked, but if I pulled half this behavior I'd have been fired in a minute. More importantly, it's no way to treat your fellow human beings.) The gate staff are pleasant and helpful and always had good experiences there. I'm chalking that up to my airline though, which is why I'm a loyal customer. There are very limited food options. This doesn't bother me because i'm good with a sandwich, but your options are a sandwich or Ruby Tuesday. ""Shopping"" is nonexistant.

The ground staff seem miserable and unfriendly and the passport control queue was massive (we arrived on a Thursday around noon). The queue was very slow moving and it took us about an hour to get through. I then expected our bags to be on the carousel, but they took another 15 mins to come through. On the plus side, when flying out everything was smooth and quick and there are plenty of shops, bars and eating places to choose from.",1

It is small, crowded, and smells like an overflowing bathroom. I think that this place was Dante's inspiration. If you have a layover here do yourself a favor and take the shuttle to the much nicer terminal C. Whatever you do do not take the monorail-you will have to go through security again. Hellish.

Everything from the check in lines, to security lines, food lines, etc... is the epitome of inefficient. The facility is outdated, the staff are rude and unpleasant.

Now, can not simply talk to a person and place your order. Can't buy a stinking bag of pretzels without using a computer.

Food crumbs and debris all around. The ceilings have large stains and holes. The carpet tiles are ripped up. A young girl tripped on one. Signage to go from our international flight in Term C to here was practically non-existent. There were no staff to assist. A bag belt worker helped us located a map to the airport. There don't seem to be operational water fountains in the area. The terminal is packed with nowhere to sit due to everyone's flight delays.

Newark is very convenient for me but the airport itself shows no interest in providing a quality experience. They seem to have recently added food and beverage in this area and it's a total mess. Uninviting. Tons of potato chips and soda stacked high on the shelves. I bought a straight forward sandwich that was inedible. The main attraction, sitting in the middle of the concourse, is a bar with 100's of bottles of liquor. It's all in very poor taste.",-1
2017-09-16,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,worst airport in memory,False," The worst airport in the world in my opinion as someone who travels every week. Poor technology, hostile united and TSA staff, inept, told to use my app to figure out where and if my flight would land and depart since all terminals said on time. Hours delayed flight never shown on monitors said either on time or closed, staff told me flight had left, when it hadn't even arrived from Hartford. Once it was boarded, later flight was cancelled and then they over fueled flight, and tried to get people off, lack of information, signage, air bus than shuttle to flight, stairs to plane. Tried to leave and drive to my destination but was informed by baggage claim that to get my checked bag could take up to two hours. This airport and many others in America simply should be shut down. It's government, it's the airlines, it's what we have created. I just returned from Japan and all I can say as an American, we should all be embarrassed. It is such a joke, it seems intentional - culture, service, technology all make it the worst airport in memory and the worst airline experience",-1
2017-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,it was the worst airport experience,False,"  My family have travelled regularly for years via Newark to Ireland and have come to expect a busy and crowded security area: hence we always allow adequate time for moving through the check in and security. On our last trip we had over 3 and half hours to get though security and I have to say it was the worst airport experience any of the family have endured at any airport. The new and improved system that is now in place at Newark consists of TSA staff yelling at travelers from the moment they join the security line. We were consisting yelled at to ""keep moving"" and ""move on"" despite the line moving as fast as anyone could. It was extremely stressful and totally unnecessary as there was no where to move on to any faster than we were already moving. It was nothing short of abusive and disrespectful. Getting through security in Newark was never pleasant but now the TSA are treating passengers nothing short of cattle to be herded. After 35 minutes of being screamed at my bag was selected for a search. This was no problem except the many staff that were supervising this section of security were extremely slow and uncommunicative. I stood for 20 minutes while the staff avoided all eye contact with the passengers and spoke only to each other. A passenger beside me who was in a wheel chair was visibly upset by the loss of her documents - which the staff appeared unconcerned with. Eventually someone checked my bag, rudely and without any civil communication with me. I can only assume that TSA training is now to treat passengers with distain as that was our experience from the start to the end of getting through Newark security. Occasionally a staff member would single out a lucky passenger who would be allowed to jump ahead in the line or have his bag prioritized in the inspection area. There may have been good cause for both these things to occur but in a system which already treats the passengers with contempt it seemed a random and arbitrary abuse of power. As it stands right now it is inefficient and there is an obvious disregard for passenger experience or wellbeing. When you finally get through security you will be rewarded by extortionate pricing for food and drinks. We all know that food in airports is expensive but Newark takes it to new heights! And forget it if you have a family and try to use the bazaar - it will takes forever and you will need a minimum of 2 adults and even this is still expensive. My advise is avoid Newark if at all possible - I am going to drive an extra hour next time right past Newark - just to avoid the horror! If I could give zero stars I would!",-1

The TSA for gates A, American Airlines is a joke - sometimes open, sometimes closed, sometimes I wait in line with everyone without pre check - total joke. And rude? I know why everyone around the country looks at Jersey in a negative light because Newark airport and its employees are the first expierience and impression of NJ. I could go on and on!

",False,"  I have been a frequent flier for the past 17 years. I am from NJ so Newark is my best bet to travel to and from. It is really hard to find something good to write about this airport. Besides the fact that delays are the norm both in and out, the people working there are so miserable its depressing. No one smiles, no one wants to offer help. The TSA there are even rude. I think it all comes down to the leadership. If you look at any organization that gets horrible reviews you must start with the head of the snake. Newark needs to fire the head of the airport (both Port Autority and the Airport). They need to start over. Newark is an embarrassment to our Tri State area. Maybe someone will read this who has the ability to make change.",-1

We flew in after a long 5 hour flight, and went searching for some food to eat. If you want to pay 22.00 for a burger or 12.00 for a veggie wrap, 28.00 chicken, what? Do you think everyone who travels has money to just blow on mediocre food? This is appalling! There is one fast food option, Wendys, and it's in gate B, not A, or C, and if you want to get to any other gate, you have to walk out of security, take a bus to gate B and then go back through security just to get a Wendys burger? Also where's the water fountains where you can fill up your water bottles? Such a disgrace.",-1

I had the worst experience at Newark Airport. Going through security made me feel like a prisoner not a paying passenger - people working there were yelling the rules at you while you're in line for security, one airport staff dropped my bin with my whole bag and phone in it and all of my bag's contents fell on the floor, she then picked up my stuff from the floor and threw my shoes and purse onto the conveyor belt with all my stuff emptied out on the belt. When I said ""please don't throw my bag"" she looked at me, rolled her eyes and then yelled at the crowd ""people hurry up and move forward!"" Rude, uncaring, depressing people working at a poorly maintained airport that looks like it's experienced no updates or renovations since the '90's. Anyone traveling with older passengers who need more time through security should especially avoid this airport at all costs.",-1

They made me go through the full procedure as if I were staying in the US! I had to line up to show my passport and my ESTA, I had to wait for my suitcase, stay in line again to clear custom, then give back my suitcase. I had to stay in line a 4th time to go again through security! During all this process the staff were not helpful at all! I had to run from one place to the other asking people to let me pass in front of them! Ridiculous! I will avoid this airport in the future.",-1

Particularly arrival, was smooth and with friendly but professional treatment by customs etc. Departing was also quick (very nice that SAS has self-service at the terminal) and security went quick and efficient as well. The airport was pretty calm and not chaotic at all. The only two things I would like, was quicker boarding. The staff was so slow and it seemed very unorganized. And also, why does this airport not have free unlimited wifi? It is something almost everyone uses and something I really value when traveling. I don't understand why such a huge and international hub, do not offer this as a service. Upon arrival, we used the airtrain, which worked really well. My first time at Newark was fine, but this was a pleasent experience.",1

Immigration and customs were surprisingly quick and even friendly but the EWR staff directing arriving passengers to the appropriate queues were rude and even bordering on offensive. Perhaps someone should remind them that the passengers they were shouting at just endured a 16 hour flight from literally halfway around the world. Nevertheless, baggage claim, even for non priority passengers went pretty quick, so this was a 5-star arrival for me. Departing was another story. I could not imagine how US airports catering to internationally departing passengers have the gall to charge $6 for a cart when Asian airports (even the ""worst"" ones like MNL) offer it as a free service. Check in and TSA security was quick and even courteous, but beyond security for a midnight trans-pacific flight, there were no (not even little) dining, shopping nor lounging options outside of the gate seating. The bars and restaurants were closed and even the snack shop which offered dodgy cold selections closed 2 hours before the flight boarded. No wifi available meant a lot of bored passengers.",-1
2017-04-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,old and need a major update,False,"  The terminal buildings are old and need a major update. I have been to many airports in Asia and Western-Europe, but Newark is definitely not on the same level with those airports. On arrival, we were confronted with a long line of queues for the paspoort check. We queued for about 1.5 hours. The TSA agents did a good job guiding the queue and kept everyone ""on the leash"" during queuing. But the Homeland Security agents do not have a good work ethic. One of the agents just left his station to chit chat with another agent a few feet away from his post while there was a queue for his counter and ""our agent"" was just casually talking about hockey with another agent while handling our documents. The bagage claim area was overloaded with luggage from different flights. One luggage carousel handled more than two flights at the same time resulting in the luggage from the earlier fights being unloaded and put on the floor, all mixed up. On departure day, I found out that I had to pay $6 to use the luggage trolley! Never ever occurred to me that I had to pay for an airport trolley everywhere in the world. So I decided not to use them. Ground crew was not friendly at all, no smile and didn't even look me in the eye during check in. Beverages and foods were overpriced. A total of $13 for a glass of beer! No wifi available and very limited choice of restaurants. To sum it all up, Newark Liberty airport is just a horrible place to be. Bad service, overpriced foods and beverages (even for American standards), old buildings and probably way beyond its capacity.",-1

I could not believe that I couldn't buy an alcoholic drink at any of the bar/food outlets with cash. You are required to use credit cards which I won't do when abroad. The staff were totally unhelpful. Our flight was announced as delayed from 7.35pm you 8.00 pm but we didn't start boarding until 8.40pm. No explanation whatsoever, the toilets were also a disgrace. I have always been under the impression that American service and hospitality is second to none. Don't believe a word of it. Do not use UA or Newark airport.",-1

Terminal C, Self check-in was easy, there was the usual queue for passport control, but nothing too bad. My gate was C80, so I made my way down to the gate, and feeling hungry and I fancied a beer, so called in at one 'eatery' where I was welcomed and sat at a table with an iPad in front of me. A quick glance around told me that every table had a tablet - so I listened while I was told to scan my boarding card barcode and shown how my my name instantly popped up with flight details for all to see - especially as the waiter read my name out quite loudly (which I wasn't terrifically thrilled about in these days of identity theft). I quickly scanned through the menu, the food was astronomically highly priced for even the simplest dish, and beers likewise for ales I'd never heard of. So I fled the place, thinking I'd find a cheaper bar where I could pay by dollar notes, and discuss a choice of food and beers with a friendly barman. But alas, no. Some mastermind of planning had persuaded the airport chiefs of Newark to adopt a full tablet ordering system for every eat and drink outlet. Thirsty, I decided to call in at the Vesper Tavern. At least I recognised the beers on tap, and after my stomach had flipped a somersault at the prices, I decided that I needed a drink, fast. I scanned my barcode again, selected my beer from the menu (note, that the picture of each draft beer shows a full pint - or at least large looking glass of frothing beer), pressed the pay button, and as already mentioned by someone else, spotted the service charge was set at 18%. For what? I'd had no service so far! So I wound it down to 0%, and begrudgingly, I swiped my card (although I'd preferred to have paid in dollars), and waited for my beer to come. Along strolled the waiter with a wimpy looking glass of beer. It certainly wasnt the pint I'd seen pictured on the menu! I sat and observed others coming, and of their dismay at ordering expensive food and drink by tablet. My issue with this is that there's no dialogue between the customer and the staff. Little chance to discuss the food, how you would like the food cooked? Which option would they recommend from experience? Could I sample a beer that I'd never heard of? And if the service was good, then at the end, I'll leave a tip to reflect it - not to have an 18% surcharge lumped onto my bill for something that could have been delivered by a little train on a track, sushi style. I'd love to think that in a year or two I'll re-visit terminal C and all the tablets will have been strpped out and replaced once again by the happy chatter of conversion between customer and bar staff. But somehow, the investment made in this new technology will be made to work. Somehow.",1

I had no check-in luggage and whilst there was a single line queue for security which stretched someway down a narrow passageway, I still had plenty of time to kill.

Arrived last evening on United Airlines flight 1051 from Cancun, Mexico. Arrived at 7.35 pm. The information on monitors had incorrect information about what carousel your flight's luggage would be on. In fact all the flights coming in were put on one carousel (# 11) and the other carousels were empty. Even the announcement overhead was giving out incorrect information. There were virtually no personnel around to direct people coming in from all over the world and the signage was very poor. After passport check the chaos really began. The line for customs stretched around the entire baggage area with more and more people arriving it was impossible to know where to go. Again, there was no one supervising or directing people. There was no visible sign for global entry. People started to get desperate and cutting into lines, people were threatening each other and fistfights were imminent. There was no one to even ask what lines to get on. I had to use my cell phone to call Homeland Security to alert them to the increasingly dangerous situation. I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future. Worst airport experience I have ever had.",-1

I arrived on Icelandair flight FI623 at around 7:30. Hundreds of people lined up in long queues for passport check. Only One agent was available for the hordes of passengers. The wait was excruciating. Another agent showed up in his booth, 2nd to last from the right, but took about 30 minutes to get settled in, arranging his fan, walking around, looking up at us and smirking without any sense of urgency. It is obvious the people hired to do this job do not have great work ethics. Another agent came into his booth and left promptly to talk on his phone. By the way, many of the employees were sitting around texting on their phones so maybe you ought to make it a rule that texting or talking on the phone is not permitted during work hours. When departing from Iceland, we encountered a long line upon arrival to airport but we were processed so quickly and efficiently in under 10 minutes.  I will discourage people from using Newark airport from now on. It's an embarrassment the way they treat customers. This airport gives our country a very bad first impression to our first time visitors.",-1

There was very long queue in immigration but the staff were trying their best to ease out things. Unfortunately at such a busy time there were only two counters open for the non USA passport passengers. Overall it took around 45 minutes to clear immigration. Staff were polite and not overly friendly. Luggage came out by the time I reached the carousel. However its really unfair for passengers arriving from international flights to pay 6$ for a luggage trolley which should actually be free. We exited without any issues and took a yellow cab for the trek into busy Manhattan. Overall much better than JFK.,1
2016-10-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,5.0,1.0,,,,best avoided if at all possible,False,"  Newark Airport is best avoided if at all possible. The only reason I use it is that United Airlines flies to the destinations that I need. Security lines are long and the security people can get stressed and be can be abrupt. Recently all of the restaurants appear to have transitioned to a system where you order your food through an iPad situated on your table. Throughout your meal you are bombarded with screens trying to entice you to buy something or other. Service and food quality is mediocre and food prices are extremely high. The best advice I could give to travellers would be:- 1) For international travellers arriving at Newark allow plenty of time if you have a connecting flight as you have to reclaim and recheck your baggage and the time it takes to get through immigration, customs and security can be very long. I usually allow three hours. Try to fly direct and avoid connection at Newark if possible. 2) Join the United Airlines club so you will have somewhere to get out of the noisy and busy terminal and you can get a snack so you can avoid using the expensive restaurants.",-1

My wife and I flew out of Newark Terminal C Friday and back Sunday. We had no problems. Plenty of seats at the gate with lots of places to plug your phone or laptop in to charge. One thing I noticed, the cheap eat options at EWR are gone and replaced with expensive options. So if your trying to be savvy about spending eat before you go into security. Security was pleasant too and the staff were friendly. One thing terminal C is in bad need of is moving walkways. As when we landed back we arrived at gate C98 which a very long walk with no moving walkways. EWR is still the best airport in the NYC/NJ area.",1

This morning, the line for the security stretched from one end of the terminal to the other. There were numerous kiosks to check in but the lines were not organized and completely jumbled. And now they have you putting your own bag tag onto your bag - like that is going to save any time whatsoever. If they say be here 3 hours ahead, even for a quick flight to say, Atlanta, be here 3 hours ahead or else you will miss your flight. Guaranteed. Terminal C is absolutely the worst terminal I have ever been in. And I won't even begin to tell you about trying to drive up to the terminal just to be dropped off. I'm sure you can imagine the nightmare. Atlanta may be the busiest in the US but Newark terminal C needs a complete overhaul.",-1

General view of this airport is that it is old, worn and cramped. Also it was not as clean, as I am used to. It was also poor air conditioning and it was warm. It took quite a lot of time to get from the international terminal via the immigration control and get to the United Airlines domestic terminal. The immigration control was correct, polite and efficient, and can be regarded as a better part of this airport. The seats were simple and not so comfortable. They offer some dining but it was not at standards as I am used to. It was expensive there too. The restrooms was not clean and non-functional. I was indeed happy when I left this airport, sad but true. One of the worst so far in my view. I will avoid it if possible.",-1

The bathrooms in Concourse A number 1 per gender. Get ready to stand in line if you're of the female gender.
