From check in, thru security and the passenger boarding area. Security helped my wife greatly because of back surgery, she said they were wonderful.",1
2021-06-07,0.1,Business,1,2,1,3,1,,,1,one of the most inefficient and unfriendly airports,True," I am 40,000 miles short of a million miler. This might be one of the most inefficient and unfriendly airports I have ever entered! The only word I can think of is line! Two words slow lines. Do not be fooled of a small airport running smoothly. I had a 6.00am flight that I arrived at 4.30 and just got to my seat at 5.45! An hour and fifteen minutes for what two small planes? Maybe they should serve coffee at the airport. Slow and grumpy is all you get at this airport!",-1

",False,  The TSA crew at this airport are notoriously overwrought. I was a TSA precheck customer with a carry on bag. It contained a sewing machine which had to be nitrite screened. These folks for all the years I've been traveling there to visit my daughter make the most of their authority. It's become a source of jest as it appears they need to justify their existence by overdoing the job to the point of inconsequential increments. Where is the common sense? The rest of the airport is a nice place. The remodel is excellent. The airline crews are friendly and helpful. Could we please calm down the TSA crew!,-1
