2018-05-22,0.1,Business,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,the worst customer service,False,"  Fort Wayne airport is so busy trying to save dollars they have created the worst customer service I've experienced in my entire life flying all over this country and several others! I will go to any other city, even if it means driving hours out of my way to avoid flying in or out of this airport. They have all their counter employees going out and helping in the loading departments and because of it they leave before the designated time and then lie right to the face of customers saying, ""No we were here until far after it was time for you to be here"". The security guards screamed at my entire family (we had children with us!) telling us we should have been there sooner, you were late."" They have done this to every professional friend we have. They just don't want to have enough staff to do the job so they fail to provide for those of us spending thousands of dollars for flights out of their airport. Well, never again!",-1
