2020-03-01,0.7,Solo Leisure,5,4,5,5,2,2,,4,A very easy airport to use,True," The passenger terminal in Fargo has limited but all the essential services. I used it for arriving and departing to hub cities for onward connections. Taxi drivers were near the baggage belts, soliciting fares. On departure, you check in on the main floor and take escalators one flight up. To your left is a large enough gift shop with the usual items plus North Dakota State University memorabilia. On the right is a food court with a few eateries, including a Subway. The security check was smooth. Once on the airside, there is a coffee shop and a kiosk of a shop - a miniatiure version of the gift shop on the other side. There are quite a few chairs and signage is good. A very easy airport to use and quick to get out of and quick to get in.",1
