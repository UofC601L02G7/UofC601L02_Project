2020-04-18,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,overcrowded with unhappy and angry passengers,True," We were returning back home to Virginia via ORD and our ASE to ORD flight got cancelled. The main lobby and check-in/ticketing area of Aspen Airport does not have a vending machine for even water. TSA did not allow already checked-in passengers to go through security and wait in the gates section due to some ""safety"" issue due to overcrowding in the gates area. We had to wait five hours. Twice I went to the bathroom and through a windowed door you could see the gate area with FEW people while the front of the airport building was overcrowded with unhappy and angry passengers. I already sent my complaint to American Airlines. This issue of no water, soda or food for hours is not acceptable in todays world. For sure I have no desire to visit Aspen due to this awful airport and airline experience.",-1
