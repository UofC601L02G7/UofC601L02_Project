2024-06-08,0.3,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,CLEAR is lacking manners,True,"  At the Austin airport, it was presumed by the CLEAR agent that I was not a CLEAR member so when I entered the line, they tried to re-direct me. I stated I had clear, they again re-directed my “all the way down” to a different clear line, maybe? I instead opted for the TSA line which was adjacent to the CLEAR station I was at, however when I entered the TSA line… same clear agent screams “all the way around the corner, that’s not the line, it’s not the line” to which I responded I’m doing TSA pre-check instead so she again ye;;sacross asking “but is that on your boarding pass?”  oblivious that I have TSA pre-check and CLEAR. Furthermore, CLEAR always makes me show my ID despite it advertising as ID-less. All in all, TSA precheck is a more efficient, respectful, organized process. CLEAR is lacking manners.",-1
2023-08-25,0.8,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,many good places to eat,True,"  I have a been a frequent traveler of Austin-Bergstrom Airport (AUS/KAUS) since the airport opened back in 1999. I have seen the airport grow and change over the years. The changes over the years have been for the better! Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Pros: clean, great dining, bars, and rest areas. The Delta lounge is the nicest lounge in the airport. Cons: restaurants close early, so if you arrive on a late(ish) flight you will not have food options.",1
2023-08-14,0.2,Business,5.0,4.0,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,what a lousy setup,False,  Making your customers walk in the searing heat halfway across the airport to find taxis and rides is pathetic. Any chance I get I will tell people what a lousy setup it is. Also there are too few elevators to deal with the people.,-1
2023-04-17,0.2,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,Very poorly managed,False,  Getting through security early in the mornings is a nightmare. Very poorly managed. Almost missed my flight. It is necessary to have at least 2 of the 3 checkpoints open any time of the day.,-1
2023-03-11,0.7,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,2.0,3.0,the bathrooms didn’t used to be this dirty,True," I’m from Austin, and the bathrooms didn’t used to be this dirty. Since Covid I’ve traveled 10-15 per year, and the bathrooms have consistently been getting dirtier. Even just now, there’s water all over the floor, multiple stalls have no toilet paper, there’s one stall that was too gross to mention, soap and water all over the sinks and mirrors. Please fix this so Austinites can go back to being proud of our airport.",-1
2022-11-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Nowhere accepts cash,True,"  Been traveling for a week only have my petty cash left. Get to the airport in Austin Texas expecting to get something to eat and drink for my six year old. Nowhere accepts cash in this  airport except conveniently enough all the bars serving liquor do! Tell me why the staff here find it laughable that I can get a cocktail and pay in cash, but getting a juice is not happening.",-1
2022-11-19,0.2,Business,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,This was and is disgusting,False,"  I had ae three hour lay-over and my first time in Austin's airport. From the time I walked into the bathroom, the stench was overwhelming, I actually had to vomit. There was toilet paper all over the floor and body fluids from people utilizing the bathroom on the toilets, floor and especially the most disgusting part tissue holder. I went to find a sandwich to take on my flight and decided to sit at the countertop. The tables were filthy, the trash cans were overflowing. There was no one to ask to assist or call to have someone clean the area. I will avoid at all cost never to go through this airport again. This was and is disgusting.",-1
2022-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,there’s no one to help,False,"  Never been so disgusted at customer service before, I am usually not the type to ever write a bad review but everyone I spoke with was rolling eyes and talking with attitude, not to mention there’s no one to help get around considering not everyone knows what exactly to do. dirty bathrooms, extremely crowded and it made me super uncomfortable. I just got off a 4 hour flight, super tired just want to go home, my flight got delayed which isn’t their fault because of the weather but overall so disappointed. This is the first time I have ever been so disappointed in an airport and I have flied many times to many different countries. And we should have higher standards for American airports. How does that happen seriously so disgusting. I have lived here 18 years and have never been more disappointed!",-1
2022-05-11,0.2,Family Leisure,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,Do better Austin Airport,True,"  As a nursing mother the lactation pod as the only option for privacy was absolutely disgusting. Filthy, dirty, dusty, sticky. Wrappers everywhere. Unacceptable to say the least. I used my wipes to try and clean it. And they were almost black. Do better Austin Airport.",1
2022-05-06,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,5.0,3.0,airport is absolutely disgusting,True,"  This airport is absolutely disgusting. Trash and food everywhere, packed full of people, rude staff, and limited food options. Not to mention that every time I fly out of here, my flight is delayed. There’s gang stickers all over the place. Just sit down and look around. (If you can even find a seat) The only positive thing I can say is that they offer Disabled Veterans free parking.",-1
2021-12-22,0.5,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,has limited food options,False," AUS has limited food options, specifically at breakfast. Those with a 0500 flight time have no real breakfast options. Additionally, I was disappointed the airport didn’t prepare better for holiday travel. Austin has had an influx in its population and the airport already struggles. The holiday travel rush was not well prepared for and the patrons struggled. Open airline check in earlier and security to better serve their customer.",1
2021-12-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,,2 hours to get through Security,False," Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was chaos this morning.  We've already eaten the cost of Delta Airlines tickets, and we're scrambling to get on another airline. There were hundreds of people Outside the doors of the airport at Each security line! It took 2 hours to get through Security this morning. We went to American Airlines where the folks in front of us had missed their flight and they were trying to rebook, and the family behind us had missed their flight and they were trying to rebook. It's 5:45 AM, clear skies, no weather problems. I hope I Never have to use this airport again.",-1
2021-07-26,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,The south terminal was a nightmare getting to/from,True, The south terminal was a nightmare getting to/from. They must have been short handed because the shuttles were about 30 minutes apart and could only hold around 10-15 people at a time. Definitely needs better logistics getting from main terminal to the south terminal.,-1
2021-07-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no place to sit down or eat,True,  Terrible experience at this airport! Spent too long waiting for transport to South terminal. Once there no place to sit down or eat! Felt punished for choosing to fly Allegiant!!,-1
2021-04-28,0.7,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,,,escalators and elevators were turned off,False,"  Upon returning my car rental on the 3rd floor of the rental garage, all escalators and elevators were turned off. Since the car was returned there was no way to go down without walking the entire length of the escalator with luggage. Other passengers that were in wheel chairs had children and the elderly could not get down. There were no attendants to assist anyone. This was at 5:30am on a Monday. These should be on 24 hours a day since you can return your car anytime.",1
2020-10-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,no social distancing or hand sanitizers around,False,"  There was no social distancing or hand sanitizers around, people were just crammed in lines, no one was even worried about it. Every other airport took it seriously and had hand sanitizers everywhere. Austin didn’t seem to take it seriously at all.",-1
2020-01-08,0.3,Business,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,seems to continue its decline year after year,False,"  
Austin airport seems to continue its decline year after year. Moving taxis and rideshares to an inconvenient spot that is poorly marked (albeit improved from a few months ago) is compounded by poor shuttle service for those traveling with luggage. The interior is beautiful and I love that they’re bringing in more local businesses, however this could never mask the abysmal experience in trying to leave the airport. The “shuttles” to the taxi stand don’t even assist with luggage anymore. It is such a hassle getting out of this airport I would avoid it at all costs if I didn’t have to go for work.",1
2019-10-11,0.4,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,a surprisingly disappointing airport,True," Simply put, Austin Bergstrom is a surprisingly disappointing airport. Before I venture into the negatives, I do want to highlight the positives of the airport: The terminal opened in 1999, and has largely, recently been renovated. The dining options in the terminal are largely from very local, and locally-themed, restaurants, something unique to airport terminals around the world (as opposed to a local restaurant being located amongst a terminal full of chains). The airport's clean, modern and fairly spacious even given its small size. The seating areas feel more like very nice doctor's offices than the traditional airport seating arrangements. Parking is close to the terminal, even economy parking, and it's reasonably priced. Access off Highway 71 is easy, whether coming from Austin and I-35 to the west or Bastrop and Houston to the southeast. The airport doesn't feel particularly crowded, even during peak passenger traffic hours. And yet, I can't bring myself to give this airport any more than a 4/10 overall rating. I don't particularly enjoy flying out of here. For one, the signs directing drivers to parking areas, arrivals, departures, and the correct lanes for regular vehicles and buses/livery are poorly marked, in my opinion. Even chaotic airports like LAX and O'Hare have better signage for such, strangely. Secondly, once you're within the airport, signage to direct people to check-in areas, rideshare and taxi pickup areas, and security isn't exactly the clearest, not the worst I've seen, but enough to make a small airport relatively confusing. Thirdly, once you're past security, it's surprising to find that the restaurants that serve tacos, meals, margaritas, beers - the things you'd expect to find in an airport in Austin and Texas are slowing down or even closed after 8.00pm. Fourthly, the personnel that work here are very hit and miss, but generally unfriendly. For example, the ticketing agent for Spirit Airlines (not exactly the budget airline with the best reputation) was very pleasant and courteous. The TSA agent who checked my driver's license, a super friendly and chatty guy. But, the shuttle bus drivers between economy parking and the terminal were little more than manner-devoid rubes. The actual x-ray screening agents for TSA were some of the biggest smart-asses (and not the fun kind, but the unpleasant kind) that I've ever met in my life, period. The restaurant servers and bartenders don't give customers eye contact while providing service, and can often be found tapping their feet while interacting with customers and not interacting with one another at all while working. That's the part that leaves me cold; for all the talk of Texas hospitality, it is sparse in this airport. In summary, there are much worse airports in the USA, but there are also much better airports in the USA and abroad. Only fly into Austin if you must!",-1
2019-09-28,0.9,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,the best experience we’ve ever had entering the USA,True, This was the best experience we’ve ever had entering the USA. We were literally the first off our plane through an extremely quiet immigration area and greeted by the most pleasant Customs Officer ever. He was so charming and full of local advice and obviously very proud of his city. He even searched for events for us to go to and could not have been more helpful. It is a quieter airport compared to somewhere like Miami so maybe they are more laid back but the difference it made to the start of our holiday was amazing. Well done Austin.,1
2019-09-26,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,Very unprofessional,False,"  None of the vendors take cash. None of the food service people understand that folks have flights to catch. Slow as molasses like they could not care less with 5 others in the back. Very unprofessional. Where is the Starbucks? I’ve tried all the coffee places with the many trips I have taken and none come close. I just want a large, (big) iced coffee when I get off the plane like any other airport. Of the many airports I travel through, Austin gets the worst rating.",-1
2018-07-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,rude and inefficient,False, Austin International Airport fail. Waited 30 minutes to open the airplane doors. 10 electronic passport control machines for nearly 500 passengers. 8 work. Had to stand in line to recheck our bags to our final destination behind all the people that were originating in Austin (we had just flown 11 hrs in from Lisbon.) Other airports do a simple recheck right after customs. TSA very rude and inefficient. I’ve never had to separate carryon snacks for the X-ray at any other airport. Of course our bags didn’t make it and the airline won’t deliver them since the recheck made them categorized as late. Alaska personnel were fantastic but I will avoid Austin at all costs from now on.,-1
2018-05-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,very hard to see in the dark,False,"  The parking garage also houses the rental car companies. The garage is under construction and the signage for Rental Car Return is so dusty it is very hard to see in the dark (5.45 am on May 19, 2018). I missed it twice and had to ask airport security where it was. It took 30 minutes to find it, causing me to miss my flight. (Also, on entering the terminal there is no signage showing which airlines are to the left and to the right.) Fortunately my airline re-booked me on the afternoon flight at no extra charge. The chances are very low that I will never use this airport again.",-1
2018-05-20,0.5,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,"Hard to find where you need to go""
",False,  Shuttles to and from parking areas and south terminal involve a long wait in the heat and a rather long ride. Shuttle drivers are courteous. Hard to find where you need to go because directions are not clearly posted. All in all rather inconvenient. Maybe it will be better when construction is complete.,-1
2018-04-09,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,1.0,,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,surprised how filthy it was,False,"  I have traveled all over the world and have used some digusting mens rooms. Today, I felt like I entered a 3rd world men's room this morning. Had to clean my own toilet seat. My wife used the ladies room the same time. She was surprised how filthy it was. Someone should lose their job.",1
2018-02-23,0.8,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,a pleasant airport,True," Austin-Bergstrom is a pleasant airport. The lines at TSA were very mild while we were at this airport, and the design of the airport is open and clean. Check-in with Southwest was as easy as usual, staff were friendly. The seating at the gates was plentiful, something which is surprisingly uncommon across the US. However, food and shopping options seemed severely limited and the airport was undergoing construction.",1
2018-01-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Long delays due to technical difficulties,True," Long delays due to technical difficulties at the airport. On my original day of departure, the Austin computers were down and the flight was expected to be delayed by 45 mins due to manual checking process. Since I was going to miss my Atlanta connection, I rebooked my flight for the next morning and stayed an extra night in Austin. The next morning the jetway was broken at my gate and the flight was delayed yet again for more than 45 mins. Both times, it seemed to take much longer than necessary to adjust to or fix these problems which is just unaccectable. Austin airport is currently not able to adapt to the increased traffic of this city.",-1
2017-12-29,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,"This is the worst airport ever""
",False,"  This is the worst airport ever. As a business traveler and having just moved to Austin this year from Dallas, TX I never realized how spoiled I was living in Dallas and traveling from DFW. The city of Austin is in denial. This airport is so busy and doesn’t even have enough gates, not many direct flights, no services. Security lines horrible, traffic at drop off and pick up is a nightmare. With all the people moving in to Austin you would think that the city would expand the airport, expand highways and improve infrastructure. Unfortunately this city lacks major infrastructure. If you are thinking about moving to Austin think again. I am moving back due to this airport. This year has been nothing but living hell traveling weekly through this airport.",-1
