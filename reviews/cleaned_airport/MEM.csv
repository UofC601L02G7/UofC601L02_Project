2024-05-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,4.0,2.0,2,2.0,5.0,TSA claimed they were not responsible,False,"   Yesterday, 5/14/24, we arrived at Memphis airport at 4:55am for 6:05 am flight to Philadelphia. Upon receiving our boarding passes at the kiosk, we noticed a long line of at least 500 passengers waiting to pass through security. The line seemed endless, and we later found out that the airport only had four security checkpoints for over 12 flights scheduled to depart between 6am and 7:30am. When we inquired about the delay, TSA claimed they were not responsible, despite the airline attendant mentioning that TSA's understaffing had been an ongoing issue for morning flights. Due to the long wait, we missed our flight by 11 minutes and were rebooked on a connecting flight to Philly via Charlotte. Shockingly, 70 other passengers (fact) also missed their flight to Charlotte from Memphis. My advice to others is to arrive at least 2 1/2 hours early for flights departing from Memphis. The understaffed TSA seemed indifferent to the chaos, and there were confrontations in the line. Many latecomers appeared distressed, and there was even a member of the Memphis SWAT team present to maintain order before passengers entered the security checkpoint. Good luck! Side note: Huge shout out to Rejoice, the Gate Attendant at American Airlines, for having the patience of a SAINT and getting us on the next connecting flight to Charlotte!",-1
2023-03-27,0.2,Business,3,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,4.0,2.0,Somebody needs to fix this place,True, Great MEM airport. This airplane has been here for hours. We’ve been loaded for 30 minutes. Waiting for fuel. Apparently they only have one damned small fuel truck. He fuels a commuter jet and has to go back to the farm before he can do a second one. Fantastic. Crew had to wait 3 hours last night for fuel. Somebody needs to fix this place. Nice terminal but management and operations suck at their jobs.,-1
2022-09-19,0.9,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,4.0,4.0,tidy and seems pleasant,False,"  The airport itself is tidy and seems pleasant. Being a solo traveler with hidden disabilities, I am very pleased with the staff who were able to assist me. They were helpful and kind. So far on my departures, the ques haven't been too long a wait or crazy, timely manner in my experience. Look forward to coming back again as I'm a frequent flyer to this airport.",1
2020-07-21,0.3,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,3.0,3,,1.0,Appalling Covid prevention measures,True,"  Appalling Covid prevention measures at the airport. Crowding at security with new rules about food, slowing the process because of confusion about what needs to be removed . No social distancing guidelines at gate and no mask enforcement. People sit wherever they like and pull masks down. I am truly shocked at how Memphis airport operates at the times when there is a mandatory mask mandate in place, and all good businesses work toward social distancing. Would not recommend flying out of Memphis any time soon.",-1

2016-08-13,0.6,Solo Leisure,4,3,3.0,5.0,3.0,3,,4.0,staff friendly and efficient,False,"  Departure from Memphis. The airport was ok. I regard it as the best airport I experienced during my trip - much better than Newark (EWR) and better than Chicago O'Hare (ORD). The stores and restaurants was plentiful, but the airport is quite small. The staff was friendly and efficient. It was also quite clean, much better than the other airports I passed through this trip in the USA. It was easy to navigate through too. Many small airports are better than their reputation.",1
