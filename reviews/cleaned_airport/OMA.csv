2022-05-09,0.1,Business,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,keep your head down and mouth shut,True,"  I rarely have anything negative to say about an airport as I travel frequently. I understand the airport in a small town like Omaha is small. However, when I overhear TSA agents badmouthing passengers that were just in their line to the desk agents, you know something is wrong. I guess moral of the story in Omaha, keep your head down and mouth shut.",-1
2021-02-16,0.1,Business,1,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,1.0,Absolutely terrible customer service,True," Absolutely terrible customer service again with Delta! Could not locate my flight and made my employee late for his flight today, twice in one day, once at Omaha and once at Minneapolis. Both employees were there 2 hours before flight time and still didn't make their flight because of the incompetent employees at the Delta check in. Flights were rebooked at no charge because Delta was at fault but I am not reimbursed for the time lost at the job site for these two employees. Will not be using Delta again.",-1
