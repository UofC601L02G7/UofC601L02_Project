2023-08-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Complete waste of time,True," Convenient place to fly out of if they ever maintained their flight schedules. My past three flight out of this airport have been cancelled. When I ask why they make an excuse of weather, but it’s not delayed the flight is flat out cancelled. While all the other airports in the near area are fine DSW, MDW, O'Hare. Complete waste of time, no apologies, no alternative provided than roll the dice and come back tomorrow. Airlines used to work to get you out that day or even provide alternate airline solutions. You either rebook on an app, wait on a phone for 2+ hours, or get sent on your way at the counter. Word of advice if you actually want to get somewhere on the original day intended drive to Chicago or Detroit.",-1
2023-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Management should be embarrassed,False," Flown into this airport 5 times in the last 2 months, always a issue getting a arrival gate, getting the ground crew to show up and then getting your luggage under 40 minutes after arrival. A joke for this size airport! Management should be embarrassed!! Time for some changes.",-1
2022-01-01,0.8,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,Very clean and well taken care of,False,"  Very clean and well taken care of. This airport is served by so many great airlines with diverse destinations. I do think that GRR needs more international routes. At GRR, the airport is not too big so it makes efficient travel. Also, they have a good selection of shops and stores. The airport facility looks really modern and cool for being over 55 years old. The only cons is that sometimes it can get a bit crowded and the staff doesn’t manage high groups of passengers well. Would give an 8.5 if I could.",1
2019-12-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,worst baggage claim ever,False,"  The worst baggage claim ever. No signs to tell you where to go, what claim you need to use. Crowds just stand around and wait and bags to over an hour to come out. Worst ever.",-1
2019-11-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,Terrible management,False," Terrible management of remodelling and on-property shuttles. I've traveled through numerous airports small to large some under construction, others remodelled. The remodelling of GRR's interior is taking years and is painful to navigate and claim luggage there are 2 carousels for all the airlines and flights. Further, there is no room for all the passengers who have no clue where one's bags are coming. With regard to the parking shuttle - there was too little capacity. As I knew there were more people waiting for the shuttle than its capacity; I started walking to the economy lot. I made it before the shuttle (which I only saw arriving in the lot as I was leaving! The people are nice though.",-1
2019-08-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Avoid this place at all costs,False,"  August 2019 was my first time using this airport and I will never use it again. Security staff is hands down the worst I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. The most misserable people I have ever met in my life with a goal of ruining your day. I will never use this airport again just because of them. Huge inflated egos with a badge. Avoid this place at all costs, trust me.",-1
2018-01-12,0.8,Business,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Employees are friendly and helpful,True," I fly weekly for work, and Gerald R. Ford Int'l Airport in Grand Rapids is one of my two home-base airports. It's served by American, Delta, United, Southwest and Allegiant, and has non-stop flights to twenty-something destinations. I primarily fly American, and mostly take flights that connect through Chicago O'Hare or Dallas/Fort Worth. GRR is a larger regional airport, with two concourses of 8 gates each, but not a large airport by any means. I can park in the garage, walk in, clear security (TSA Pre-Check) and walk to my gate within 15 minutes of driving into the garage. I love that kind of convenience. Employees are friendly and helpful pretty much across the board -- at the airline counters, security and at the gates. GRR recently finished a fairly large renovation, in late 2017. They now have one central security checkpoint, and a central area with new shopping and dining, including a local brewpub, Starbucks and a Michigan-themed souvenir shop, There are also new lounge areas, children's play area and a business center, not to mention new, large restrooms. In general, GRR operates on time, which is key for me. Most delays I've experienced have come from aircraft delayed at their originating airport - mostly O'Hare. I'm basically comfortable relying on this airport for my weekly business travel needs.",1
