2024-08-23,0.5,Business,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,security check is a nightmare,True, Nice looking airport with lots of great vendors but TSA security check is a nightmare. TSA PreCheck only available on the A terminal side. Airlines don't make you aware of that or let you know there is a quick path from A terminal to B. TSA checks were very slow so go to your gate early,1
2023-10-11,0.9,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," for flying domestically we like IND"" ",False,"  IND is one of our two main options along with CVG when flying. Both are excellent. Traveling from Indy this week reminded me why I like it. In morning and afternoon there are multiple good choices and most are reasonably priced in comparison to many other world airports, crowds are nowhere near some airports, so it is easy to move around, TSA has always been friendly and efficient unlike some airports, restrooms are generally cleaner than many other airports. We do wish there were a couple of direct flights options to Europe, but for flying domestically we like IND",1
2023-09-27,0.8,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,you can do better,False," The directions for the TSA PreCheck are confusing for travelers. When headed to the B concourse gates, the precheck sign points to the right and the TSA Administrative office is on the right, but closed. The sign should read that the PreCheck is on the otherside of the concourse, next to Chick-fil-A. Now, once you get to the TSA Check Point, the sign directs you to the employee entrance because someone turned it around. If the sign is in the correct direction, then travelers would know to join the amusement chains on the left. Indianapolis International, you can do better.",1
2023-08-04,0.4,Business,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,bag handling and logistics take so long,False," IND is my main hub for the last 10 years and it’s an overall very easy airport to navigate. However, I wait 45 minutes minimum every time I land here. Usually also have to wait 5-10 minutes, sitting 20 yards from the gate before anyone guides the plane in. I don’t understand how this airport continues to get awards when the basics of bag handling and logistics take so long.",-1
2023-07-24,0.1,Family Leisure,4.0,1.0,,4.0,0.0,,,,First time for one star,False, 5 stars every time for years and years. First time for one star. We are in B section and while waiting for our delayed flight to come in there is construction going on in the closed restaurant located in the middle of the airport. Not a little but extremely loud mechanical tools sawing through metals and wood. Dust coming over the protective walls causing coughing and eye irritation. What were they thinking. Hire a heavy metal band and throw in some flame throwers to match the noise in this airport. There was nowhere to go unless we wanted to not hear our gate screaming over the deafening madness.,1
2023-03-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,disappointed that everything was already closed,False,"  Had a flight leaving late. So disappointed that everything was already closed. Ridiculous! The only food available was a snack machine that didn’t work. Thank goodness the bartender at The Fan Zone bar, which should have closed at 9pm, stayed open for a sizeable number of us travelers. No restaurant, Hudson store, candy shop - nothing - open. Can’t one or two places stay open at least until 10pm?",-1
2022-06-07,0.4,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,everything closes at 8pm,True,  Literally everything closes at 8pm. No food. No drink. I have never seen anything like this. Terrible. I would have eaten before arriving to the airport if I had known this was such a barren wasteland.,-1
2022-04-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,I can't relax with a beer and a burger,False,"  8:30 P.M. on a Monday night, no restaurants open (other than fast food). No beer/wine/cocktails available in the whole airport, even outside of security. I just busted my butt working for four days at my elderly parent's yard and flying home sore, but happy to have spent time with them. Four days of hard labor vacation and I can't relax with a beer and a burger.",-1
2022-03-18,0.1,Business,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,I would not fly out of here again,False,"  Horrendous treatment by TSA on March 18, 2022. I would not fly out of here again. Extremely rude, unfriendly and unhelpful.",-1
2021-07-24,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,It has a casual laid back atmosphere,True, I been through many airports and no one airport is the same other than it is an airport with like amenities and services. However like amenities and services do vary in traveler experience. Indianapolis Airport is by far the best at everything. It has a casual laid back atmosphere but it’s efficient in all aspects of getting passengers to and from their positions whether you are coming or going. The bathrooms are clean and in working order. Food vendors are unique and suitable and quick to get you in and out. The next closest airport to Indy I would have to say is Phoenix.,1
2021-06-21,0.6,Family Leisure,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,Do better,True, It's 3.30 on a Sunday afternoon. Both coffee shops and the 3 quick pick restaurants are closed. This forces people to have to pay $11 for for sandwich that's possibly been in a cooler for 3 days. Do better.,1
2021-02-17,0.6,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,they seem to be intentionally not following guidelines,False,  Maintenance/janitorial guys - using their mask for their beards only - walking around boldly with nose and mouth not covered - watched them for some time and they seem to be intentionally not following guidelines - we're all in this together and need to follow health guidelines.,1
2018-12-24,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,repeated service deficiency,True," Overall, this is a good--even excellent--airport. However, once my husband required a wheelchair to get to and from the gates, we encountered a significant and repeated service deficiency. This last trip was not, unfortunately, an anomaly. We called ahead, followed instructions to call again when we were within ten minutes of the airport. No wheelchair. The attendants at curbside luggage called again, and pointed to a bench where we were to wait for the chair. Twenty minutes elapsed; no chair. I asked at the service desk. Another ten minutes and no chair. I finally found one and pushed him most of the way to the concourse when a wheelchair attendant finally appeared and took him the rest of the way. We have not encountered this in any other airport. If we had not had similar, repeated problems at Indianapolis International, I would not complain. This is really unacceptable.",1
2018-06-05,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"very clean and well-maintained""
",False,"  Indianapolis International Airport is great. Since it is relatively new, the inside is very clean and well-maintained. Compared to other US airports, it's significantly less crowded. The waiting areas by the gates are very nice with USB chargers and outlets, and there are many great stores and restaurants in the terminals. Baggage claim is nice and checking in is easy. Before you even go through security, there is a very nice food court. Staff are always friendly and parking is convenient.",1
