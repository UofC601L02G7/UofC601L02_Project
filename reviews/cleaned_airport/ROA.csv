2016-09-23,0.3,Business,4,3,2,1,1,1,4,1,it is impossible to know where to go,False,  The rental car area is appallingly signed. It is conveniently a short walk from the terminal but there is only an initial ramp and then there is no path for suitcase dragging people to go to the next row apart from the gaps between the cars. The different companies have small signs and it is impossible to know where to go. If one is unlucky then you need to walk back and forth to find your spot. Returning is the same problem to drive around and find the spot. I am writing this as I spoke to the rental company and it appears everyone complains but the airport will not do anything about this. Maybe this publicity will help them improve.,-1
