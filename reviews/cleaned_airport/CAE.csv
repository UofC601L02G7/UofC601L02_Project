2024-09-20,0.4,Solo Leisure,2,3,2,2,3,3,4,2,a lack of professionalism,True,"   I entered the TSA area to receive the routine security check. I had on a dress at the time, which I don't normally wear when traveling. When I walked through the metal detector, apparently my ""groin area"" on the scan indicated an abnormality? I was shown the scan where this region of my body indicated a red color. I was only told because of this, I would need a pat-down. I was pulled to the side and was told to wait for my carry-ons to clear security, so that they could perform the pat-down. The female TSA agent asked if I wanted to receive my exam out in the open or in private. I had a dress on, so I decided to choose the private examination. I was told to move to the side when my items came through security and that I had a couple of items that were problematic. So, I was told which items and that I wasn't allowed to bring them through (a scented body spray, along with a facial cleanser). I had no problems with these items on my departure from California to South Carolina. After this, I was taken into a little frosted glass area where I received the ""pat-down"". As I've never had one of these types of pat downs before, I was unprepared for what I was eventually submitted to. Another TSA agent came in so that two female TSA agents were present. I am a veteran myself but despite this, I don't normally make it a point to use this as a way to receive special treatment. The one female who put on her gloves and conducted the search was very cold, matter-of-fact and almost callous in her actions. She went up my thighs, pushing up against the sides of my crouch; she brushed her hand down over my pubic area. I automatically moved away from her hands. She had to do this 2-3 times because I kept moving. It was unintentional because my boundaries were being breached, an involuntary reaction. The one agent coldly stated that if I moved again, she would have to performing the action. I am a very tolerant person when it comes to people doing their jobs, but I felt assaulted and triggered. I got angry and teared up but allowed these insensitive, cold agents to finish. I knew that they knew I was upset even though I didn't say anything. I have PTSD, so I feel like this kind of touching shouldn't be allowed. We left the little room, the agents took my items, put them on a table and walked off. No courtesy, no nothing. It angered me. I retrieved my items on the table from the containers and tossed one on the floor and walked off to my gate without looking back. I went to a restroom, changed out of my dress into a shirt and pants. Later on, I ran into another person on my flight who had gone through TSA with her mother, who's in a wheelchair. She also had to go through the same invasive exam. Their experience wasn't long before my experience in terms of time. After, this TSA scenario when I arrived at my gate for my flight, I found out that my flight was delayed. Because I downloaded the app of the airline to my phone I was able to change my connecting flight on the suggestion of my app. While waiting along with other frustrated but resigned people, I kept hearing these announcements over the PA system about one particular flight that kept getting changed to different gates. THEN the ticket agents at my gate kept asking people to check their carry-on bags. Apparently there wasn't room enough on the flight for carry-ons. I had a feeling of a lack of professionalism, despite my personal experience. Thank goodness I won't have to visit SC again.",-1
