2019-01-07,0.4,Family Leisure,2,3,3,2.0,1,,,1.0,an absolute mess,True," We arrived 5 days ago at night and the rental car situation was an absolute mess. When we showed up at the airport today during the daylight, it wasnâ€™t much easier to figure out the mess outside. The Allegiant check in staff seemed overworked and grumpy. The airport needs some serious traffic flow help inside and outside.",-1

",False,"  Airport still ""under construction"". It looks just like it did when I flew into and out of in April of 2017. Passengers for 3 departing planes are all herded into a very small room. Very few chairs and much confusion. When will it be finished? And then passenger must walk outside through rain/etc to board planes and walk up steep ramps! Very poor! Only saw one womens bathroom with only 3 stalls.",-1
