2018-12-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,3.0,new 3rd party crew,True," United Airlines flight 301 supposed to depart at 5:35am. We are currently still waiting at 6:07am because MFR is using a new 3rd party crew with only 1 person qualified to load luggage. Unacceptable! We pay good money to fly with an airline that makes you feel safe. Now, at 6:19 am were waiting on another company to deice the wings. Flights are made months in advance. The airport and airline were aware that trained ground crew is needed to load a plane along with de icing planes. This is ridiculous!",-1
