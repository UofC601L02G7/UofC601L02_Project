2024-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,5.0,0.0,,,,incredibly rude at TSA,False," They were incredibly rude at TSA by the Southwest gate. They wouldn’t let me on to pick up my sons even though I had a gate pass. They said the machine couldn’t recognize my ID, despite me flying all the time. My ID and appearance match up. Finally a supervisor came over, after 20 minutes, looked at me, and said ok. The gate guy yelled to not get depressed over missing picking up my sons",1
2024-06-01,0.6,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,rude check in staff,True,"  The customer service at this airport is the worst I have ever experienced. The staff just seem to shout instructions which are very unclear. I don’t think I have ever come across such a rude check in staff as the lady that was checking in the BA flight to London on 31st May at F gate. We were business class and we had our passports and e tickets. She shouted at us to leave the queue as we had the wrong tickets ( or that is what she thought ) we were confused as had used them earlier, she made us feel awful and when we said we had both e tickets and paper she said we had to use paper, with that she snatched them out of our hands, rolled her eyes and huffed, she then passed them on to a colleagues whilst we stood there waiting for one of them to give back both our tickets and passports. There had been no communication or advise when we checked our luggage in that you had to have a paper boarding pass. In this day and age it seems very out of date. I felt like I was being told off, awful experience. Collecting and returning car hire was good although a pain that you have to get two separate trains but pretty quick Also if you like a wander around shops this is not the airport for you.",-1
2023-08-09,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Absolutely do not recommend,False, The customer service was absolutely terrible during security. They yelled at everyone going through and we’re not giving clean instructions and then proceeded to get mad if you got confused. I am an anxious flier and this made it so much worse. The rudeness ruined my whole experience. Absolutely do not recommend.,-1
2023-07-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,1.0,Worst airport for customer service,False,  Worst airport for customer service. Automated boarding pass scanners don’t scan right and when you have an issue you can’t find an employee in sight and when you find one they do not care one bit. Don’t ask for a manager because they will start saying that you the customer is being disrespectful.,-1
2023-05-19,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,Immigration hall is far too small,False,"  Immigration hall is far too small and the number of agents processing arriving passengers was far too few. There were only two agents processing arrivals (no kiosks available) yet about a dozen standing around with their thumbs hooked in their armored vests doing nothing but chatting with each other. Fortunately almost all the passengers on the flight I arrived on were American citizens and it seemed somewhat resigned to being treated with disdain by the immigration and customs agents. It's a pity if first time arrivals from a foreign country experience a ""welcome"" as such.",1
2023-04-20,0.3,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,disappointed in the design,False,"  Nice airport. However, poor signage for pickup by Lyft or Uber. Baggage clam then have to go back upstairs to get picked up. Very poor design. A lot more walking for disabled. Any very confusing for someone not accustom to the area. Very disappointed in the design.",-1
2023-04-18,1.0,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,,2.0,0.0,,,5.0,going above and beyond,True,"  Tampa International Airport is huge and very confusing that I ended up going to the wrong direction upon exiting. I ended up in the sky center. I asked one of the people who I assume work there because he has an ID and he happily helped me and walked with me back to where I supposed to go. He worked as a chef in PF changs yet, he helped me. He was waiting for his ride after a long busy day at work, yet he got up and assisted me. Thank you Sir for going above and beyond. There really is hope in humanity.",1
2022-07-12,0.9,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,the cleanest airport,False, TPA is the cleanest airport I have been in compared to ATL and BOS. This time I lost my ID and was frantic. The TA were so nice and said that it happens more than you think. There was a slight delay on Jet Blue but they made it up in the air. I prefer Jet Blue cuz I have never had a problem. Only once flying into Newark but it wasn't the airlines fault. Our flight was diverted because their was an explosion at Newark so all flights were diverted to LGA and JFK. Luckily I wound up in PA somewhere and they had to get us a hotel. Missed the wedding shower cuz then pilots were on overtime. Big mess. Finally I got to Newark and rented a car. Was glad to get back to Tampa.,1
2022-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Airport staff offered no assistance,False,"  Airport staff offered no assistance with flight cancellations or my wheel chair due to a significant injury to my foot. Personnel stood by while party struggled managing luggage, a 3 year old and my disability.",-1
2021-08-19,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Incredibly rude TSA employees,False,  Incredibly rude TSA employees throughout the entire check-in process. Going through security is the absolute worst. Every employee was rude. TIA service is terrible all around anymore. They used to be very polite.,-1
2021-08-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,it has gotten progressively less customer-focused,False,"  Parking: Had a cruise scheduled, with flight out of Tampa International. Due to last minute CDC and govt Covid rule changes, it was canceled. Every other group did a full refund or at least full dollar credit for future purchases, since the cancelation was due to COVID and govt reaction: airline, 3 shore excursions, cruise line, hotel. The only deposit we could not fully get back was parking at Tampa International. Of the $90 charge, we got back only $45. Tampa airport used to be the best airport in the country. Since Lopano took over, it has gotten progressively less customer-focused. Maybe Tiliocos, VP of Customer Service, has something to do with it? I emailed those two and the Feldman, head of parking. Obviously they got my emails, since Feldman, head of parking, called me to tell me personally to bugger off. Of the $5K for the trip, 45 is peanuts. But it shows how cold and uncaring the TPA has become. My flying has decreased in recent years, but I used to have gold cards on 4 different airlines and traveled at least once every week, out of Tampa. I marveled at having one of the best airports in the country nearby. I'd be extremely cautious about booking anything through TPA in these times of Covid.",1
2021-06-15,0.1,Family Leisure,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,The whole ordeal was ridiculous,False,"  The TSA security check in was one of the worst and rudest I've ever been through. The only people security bothered to run through the wringer of special security checks are senior citizens and those needing assistance. I am on crutches and was told I should have been in a wheelchair because TSA did not provide chairs for someone like me to sit on to take their shoes off. I told them that I'd happily takes my shoes off if they could provide a chair. They didn't. Then after going through the xray they had to pat me down. Twice. And check for residue. Why the heck did I have to hobble through the xray without my crutches if I was going to get pat down anyway. Looking around as I was pat down, the ONLY people getting the special security treatment was senior citizens and persons like me. And on top of that they weren't even polite about it. Someone need to answer why those two groups are treated like this. I would understand it if they at least selected some random people or other demographic but for the 20 minutes it took me to go through security they did not once check anyone else and multiple times had people go through the regular walk through metal detector because the line was getting long. The whole ordeal was ridiculous. I rarely leave reviews so this is a whole level up of bad experiences.",-1
2021-04-01,0.3,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,A smile and gentle reminder would have been far more effective,True," Dear female TSA agent, gate A, 4/1/2021, 1.20pm who chose to shriek at me and berate me for forgetting I had an electronic in my purse. Top of her lungs - “Yeah! There’s an electronic in your bag - despite him saying over and over to remove your electronics you chose not to listen, now we had to take it out!”  Wow! A) The area was hugely crowded, overhead announcements etc - people may have a hearing impairment and cannot hear in that situation - even with hearing equipment. B) I’m traveling with a special needs Child - my attention is on him as much as possible helping him to navigate a crowded and confusing situation. C.) I’ve just experienced a tragic death in my family. D) I’m sorry I forgot. I’m human last time I checked. People fly, as you know, for all reasons. While I understand your need to educate - your tone, terrible attitude and general demeanor are a terrible reflection on TSA. Sorry you had a bad day. Leave that at the front door. I can promise you didn’t make mine any better. A smile and gentle reminder would have been far more effective.",1
2020-03-10,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,the rudest people I have ever encountered,False,  The Delta employees at Tampa airport were the rudest people I have ever encountered. Throughout the entire experience trying to get to my plane was one rude person followed by another. I will never fly Delta again because of the Tampa employees. You should be ashamed and everyone should be warned not to travel with them.,-1
2020-01-30,0.3,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,I've never encountered the level of rudeness,False,"  I've been in several dozen airports in the US, Europe, and Asia, and I've never encountered the level of rudeness in airport staff as I did in Tampa.",-1
2019-12-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,What a disaster,False,  What a disaster. Currently standing in customs line as we speak having been off the plane for an hour and still have a very long line ahead. Poor management with little staff to meet the heavy demand. Find this off putting and would make me chose an alternate Florida airport in the future. Even US nations mentioning how this is embarrassing.,-1
2019-08-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I saw an outdoor smoking area,True,"  At TPA on 04/30/2019 waiting to fly back home to LGA. I love this airport. It is huge, clean and has so many food stores. Now I love it more for the following reasons. I was bored so I started walking toward gate 75 (Delta). I saw an outdoor smoking area. My goodness, it was about time as TPA had eliminated the big outside smoking area inside the airport (what is this world coming to). When I saw the people smoking there, I went inside.",1
2019-04-06,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,Terminal A restroom smells,False, Terminal A restroom smells of urine. No hot water. Water fountains do not work. Carpet dirty. Got through security very quick at 0730. I do not use rental cars here anymore. It takes too much time and high prices. I use Lyft or rent off airport.,1
2019-03-01,0.9,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"very pleasant, modern and very clean""
",False,"  Tampa is our home airport and even with the construction it’s still a very pleasant, modern and very clean. It’s very easy to navigate, my only complaint would be long term parking it’s a little confusing but overall we love TPA.",1
2019-02-09,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,security people are extremely rude,False,,-1
2018-12-14,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,1.0,whole departure experience was dreadful,False,"  After waiting for several hours in Tampa Airport we were finally allowed to board. As I approached the ramp I realized I had lost my boarding pass. I spoke to a Spirit employee, I had spoken to him earlier in the evening so I know he recognized me. My wife told him I needed to board the flight. He said, ""I was going to be nice and help you, but you can go over go the ticket counter and get your boarding pass reissued."" I am a retired, disabled military member. I also have MS."" This whole departure experience was dreadful. This staff member made the evening that much worse.",1
2018-10-03,0.5,Family Leisure,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,too large for its own good,False," I have to say I have been flying in and out of Tampa airport since the 80's and I understand that as it has grown in passenger volume, it has gotten too large for its own good. I will say that, what I call a Mall with shops and endless food options is fantastic. However the extremely high escalator is ridiculous and the distance you have to go with the tram and the speed at which it goes to the rental car location is way too far and too fast. I have anxiety and the speed is just waiting for a accident as it is way too jittery. And once you are their you have more to walk. I am not old but I did have major heart surgery but for elderly it is not passenger friendly to have to walk that much. This all makes me wonder about choosing a different airport or a different way to travel. I loved when the garage housed the rental cars. It was perfect. I would have kept the 1st and 2nd floor of the garage for car rentals and the top floors for passengers who kept their cars there. And why dont you have stars below for the Tram to the rental facility or the rental car experience.",-1
2018-06-14,0.9,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,always ample TSA agents,True," I always love flying to and from the Tampa Airport. From the drive into TPA, the airlines are cleverly color coded and then you are directed to either arrivals or departures. Then you simply have to look for the door with your airline. Once inside the main terminal, head to the appropriate ticket counter. If you have pre-checked in online, just take the air conditioned tram to your terminal (A–F). There you will go through security. There’s always ample TSA agents there to keep the crowd moving along securely and swiftly. Once through security, you are welcomed into a massive airy terminal. There’s plenty of food options from Cigar City Brewing (a popular craft beer producer in Tampa) to The Colombia Restaurant, a staple in Tampa since 1905 serving authentic Spanish fair. There’s plenty of workspace and outlets to charge up your devices. I flow the flow of this airport with plenty of signage. It’s almost impossible to get lost and everything is relatively closeby.",1
2018-04-26,0.6,Couple Leisure,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"a reasonably good, user-friendly airport",True," Have always found Tampa to be a reasonably good, user-friendly airport. Overall it's still not bad but had a few red flags come up this time. Arrived in terminal E and used the men's washroom only to find the floor completely flooded (helps if you don't think too much about that). Fair enough, stuff happens. Except when we left a week later the same washroom still had a flooded floor. Seriously? Are there no plumbers in Tampa? Pretty disgusting. Check-in areas in the main terminal are starting to show their age. Trek to the car rental facility is a bit of an adventure. Up and down endless escalators plus a far from smooth train ride. Layout of the car rental area also seems to be an accident waiting to happen. Pedestrian walkways are not well defined and (in the case of Avis) cars were parked on the walkway back to the main building. Still gets a recommended grade but barely.",1
2018-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,conflicting passenger flows,True,"  Avoid this airport!! Passenger flow choke points, intersecting traffic, triple tram rides just to get to security check point, conflicting passenger flows, enter on fourth level, go down to second them back up to fourth. Three dimensional dysfunction! Time and frustration makes the chaos of Orlando much more appealing.",-1
2018-04-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,,3.0,Suggest to fly into Orlando,True,"  Have been flying in and out of TPA for 15+ years. The experience was always a pleasant one. After landing, take the tram to the luggage area, get you bags, cross the street and pick up your rental car. The current set-up requires that after bag pick up - drag your luggage across the room, take an escalator up for 3 flights, drag your luggage to another tram,  ride a run away twisting bumping tram for at least 5 minutes to the car rental counters (at least 2 stops on the tram), drag your luggage to the rental counter, take the escalator down 2-3 flights, drag your luggage to another rental car counter to get the car keys, and finally drag your luggage to the car. This entire process took over 1:30 hours. My 1,000 mile flight from Newark to Tampa took 2:21 hours, my 5 mile track to the car rental took 1:30 hours. Suggest for future flights is to fly into Orlando and drive the 1 .5 hours from Orlando to Tampa",-1
2018-04-04,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,a total disaster in terms of customer service,True," I have been traveling through this airport since the early 1980's. The airport was clearly well designed from the start with a central hub supporting multiple airsides via automated trams. The system worked and worked well for many years. After 911, the main long term parking terminal was closed and a remote long term parking garage was built away from the main terminal. It wasn't a great solution, but the shuttle buses ran quickly and delivered you right to the correct airside. Later, the original long term parking area was reopened with increased pricing. The new remote site was renamed ""economy parking"", though at $10 per day it was hardly economy. But that price was better than the $18 per day of the reopened long term garage. So, for many years I would park in the economy garage then ride the shuttle to the main terminal. From there I would check-in at curbside and take the tram over to my airside. Recently the airport has undergone major revisions which include a monorail system that joins the economy garage to the main terminal. Also, a new centralized car rental facility has been built which is next to the economy garage and also served by the monorail. The result is a total disaster in terms of customer service. I don't know who designed this mess, but I can tell they have no idea how to move people through an airport facility. First you must find parking in the economy garage, which isn't easy because the space inventory system is now broken. There used to be signs that would tell you how many spaces were on each floor. Apparently the new construction broke that system, so good luck finding a space. Next you have to take the elevator down to the first floor, even though the monorail is located on the 4th floor. Then, you drag your luggage to the middle of the garage road and jump on the moving floor system. Yes, they mounted the moving floor in the middle of the garage's shuttle roadway. Not on the sidewalk (where they have plenty of room), but right in the lowest part of the garage where surely the Florida rains will short circuit the machinery. The moving floor thing will slowly take you to the opposite side of the garage where a new elevator systems has been installed. Where next? No problem in deciding, there are only 2 floors to select. So now you go back up to the 4th floor to wait for the monorail. And wait, and wait. There appear to be only two trains and one was broken. Once on the train, prepare for a wild ride. First the train drops 4 floors and accelerates as it follows the access road to the main terminal. People and luggage fly about as the train dips and weaves at high speed. I'm sure injuries have already occurred due to this new system. As it approaches the main terminal, the train climbs quickly and stops abruptly at the station. If you've survived this far, you must now drag your luggage to the escalator for a trip down 3 floors. Now good luck finding your airline counter. If you're flying Southwest then you're in luck, it's the first one you find. Other airlines are scattered around and the signage isn't so good. Prepare for a lot of wandering around. Once you check-in, you now ride another escalator up and find that you are nowhere near your airside tram station. So, more walking to find the correct station and ride the tram over to your airside. In my case, the airside has been redesigned (which means less space and more expensive restaurants).",-1
2018-03-10,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,5.0,Much better before remodel,True, Not enough places to eat. Much better before remodel. Lines are extremely long. Food and drinks expensive. $20 for a glass of house wine? This was in terminal C. Not sure what the other terminals are like. No complaints about the rest of the airport.,1
2018-01-26,0.6,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,it used to be a great experience,True," I have been flying in and out of Tampa for years and it used to be a great experience. The checking in and screening process are better than at most airports I know. One of the features of the airport I always enjoyed, was the availability of good restaurants, both in the terminal, before screening, and at the gate area. Last year the airport started to ""remodel"" the terminal and all of these nice restaurants were gone. I figured they would be back after the construction was over, but not only are they still doing construction a year later, the nice restaurants are gone, even in the gate area, and all they now offer is Chinese and fast food. They destroyed the whole pre-boarding experience, especially since you have to come to the airport early for your flight. The only place you can get a decent meal now, is in the airport hotel Marriott restaurant.",1
