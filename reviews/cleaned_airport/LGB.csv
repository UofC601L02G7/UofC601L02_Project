2019-09-20,0.8,Business,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,the most pathetic car wash I've ever received,True," Long Beach Airport is one of the nicest airports to fly in and out of without hassle or delays. However, if you intend to park your car with the Long Beach valet service, don't expect the complimentary car wash to be a car wash. It was the most pathetic car wash I've ever received. A toddler could have hosed it off better. The cost to park was $24 a day. I was gone on a business trip for 24 hours and when I returned I expected a nice clean car. I was wrong. Don't park your car with the valet expecting a decent Car Wash. Thank you.",1
2017-08-15,0.7,Business,5.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,unprofessional and not appropriate,False,"  I fly out of Long Beach airport whenever I can, business and personal travel. My friends and family choose to do the same. I've only had good experiences until today, 8/14 while picking up a friend and her family. The bad experience was related to a Long Beach police officer monitoring vehicles curbside. I was approached by the officer as I was opening up the back of my SUV for loading luggage. He asked me to move my vehicle twice, even after I told him my friend and her family were walking over from the luggage area outside of the airport. His demeanor and tone were aggressive and he didn't care to listen when I said my friend and her family were approaching the vehicle. He raised his voice and came very close, it made me uncomfortable. Fortunately, my friend and her family walked up, greeted me and asked what was going on. The officer just walked away. The officers conduct was unprofessional and not appropriate.",1
