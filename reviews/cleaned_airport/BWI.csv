2024-08-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,my night was so miserable,True,"   This is the second time I write about this airport. Last time it was about TSA and this time this passenger passed through quickly without any delay to to my disability. However when the plane touched down after a day of travel this passenger decided to wait at the aiport overnight. Well, after overnighting at the SFO, I thought this would be just an ordinary thing. However my night at Baltimore Washington Airport was so miserable that I must record several warnings. 1) All the eateries and cafes are closed by 11pm 2) The workers are about as friendly and responsible as formerly at greyhound 3) hourly wage mentality prevalent, so whatever is not spelled out in the handbook is okay, including for instance having ground crew workers on break purposely sitting by visitor repeatedly. 4) actually the supervision is so loose that the people going in and out of gate doors to the tarmac/cargo holding area can be wearing any ID. The guy that was eying me at Terminal C had an ID badge but he was taking a lot more breaks than a job allows. 5) all the workers seem to take a lot of breaks and sit around throughout the terminals talking, even socializing like at Terminal A. 6) At terminal C, while I was quietly sitting and napping the red-alarm bell on the ceiling at the gate went off ""by itself' several times. It also did that at the gate across where I was sitting. The alarm went on-and-off ""by itself"" four times at least, and each time, when I was sort of dozing off. I had commented to myself that the music was objectionable, and they ""changed the music to soft jazz."" So evidently the security was looking and listening to me throughout my stay, since obviously very few passengers stay here during the early morning hours. 6) When I walked to Terminal A (where I hoped there would be no alarms) the security speaker announced my last name and terminal location and that security was ""on it."" So apparently even though I am an older disabled person with no record or history of vagrancy or crime, the airport security were ""alert to my whereabouts"" to the point of announcing my last name and location so all the workers could hear. 7) At Terminal A, another ground crew again tried again to sit nearby during his ""break."" When I sort of had enough of this and was muttering to myself, that evidently was shared with some cleaning staff, and two burly janitors (twins) who were heading to clean one of the men bathrooms in Terminal A loudly and repeatedly jeered at me. ""Why does she have to keep moving around that ch*nk as if they was after her?"" that kind of thing. 8) At Terminal B it was quieter because by 4am I found of group of nonwhites who were sitting in a section. However again, another ID-badge worker tried to sit near by while I was napping. 9) Workers were also resting or napping in the food-hall area. As a consequence even though the food-halls and other shops look very attractive, I will not have any desire to eat here. 10) The nice thing about this was that while there were no formal guards questioning anyone, there are apparently enough ""night crew"" who keep going in and out of gate-doors (plus the other hidden cameras and mics) that they don't need them. The strange thing is it was hard to tell who was actually a hired worker and a part-timer with a badge who just sits around and tries to harass visitors. This is obviously why unlike at the SFO or LAX nobody wants to overnight here, period.",-1

As a former resident of Baltimore it's embarrassing. No variety, nothing open in the early am and the worst lounges. It can do way better considering the number of International travelers.",-1

2024-01-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,,,,3.0,,,,5.0,your kindness is noticed,False,"  My adult daughter had just returned from her connection in Las Vegas to Baltimore Airport in route to her final home destination in Maryland. My daughter had difficulty locating her car and had gotten on the wrong airport bus. Now normally this is frustrating for anyone, but my daughter is autistic so trying to problem solve while in a heightened emotional state is a big struggle for her. Morgan is higher functioning and prides herself on how independent she is, but after a night of flying across country and running to connection flights, she was feeling defeated and concerned about finding her vehicle as the sun was going down. A bus driver named Chris on bus 407 was her guardian angel. He went out of his way to get her to the correct bus before it got dark when the main office confirmed they were too swamped to assist. He even had to deal with an angry traveler yelling at him for taking the extra time of getting Morgan to the correct bus connection although Morgan said he was very efficient and quickly navigated her to the correct destination. Thank you Chris, your kindness is noticed and the world is a better place because of people like you!",1
2023-12-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,said that it wasn't as late as I thought,True,"  After arriving at BWI Airport around 5 PM from Detroit, I had to wait for two hours after touchdown for the handlers to begin bringing out the luggage and my suitcase was not among those that arrived. Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",-1

All employees seem to have a hourly based personality, only do was is absolutely necessary, nothing more. Most employees focus is talking to other employees and seemed bothered to have to do anything at all. Terrible customer service and willingness to help.",-1

2023-01-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,staff at security were very rude,False,"  The staff at security were very rude. I passed the security guy my passport then he mumbled something I didn’t hear. He then shouted at me to put my phone on the scanner to scan my ticket. Then I was about to walk through the security gate and one security worker was shouting in an irritated tone “push your bags through the scanner!” And as I was doing that she proceeded to shout it two more times. I heard her the first time. After that she said to her coworker “I don’t know how many times I have to say it” and her coworker said “yeah must’ve been about 4 times. I’ve stopped because nobody listens” They’re so disrespectful! Security is already overwhelming enough, especially for people with autism, anxiety etc. the first guy literally mumbled then yelled at me when I didn’t hear him. What if I had a hearing problem? The security workers need to have more respect and patience for others. The staff at Starbucks and auntie Anne’s however I didn’t have an issue with and for the most part were polite.",-1
2022-08-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,I will avoid this airport at all costs,False,"  I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future. TSA Agents were rude and condescending. Bathrooms were filthy. Restaurants were understaffed. There was no help at the gate for passengers who required assistance in boarding, so the Southwest gate agent had to bring each wheelchair passenger (10 of them) to the plane himself. Do yourself a favor and stay away.",-1
2022-08-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,Poor planning and poor logistics,True," Spent 20 minutes sitting on the tarmac waiting for a gate to open. Then spent an additional 25 minutes sitting on the plane at the gate waiting for a skyway driver to attach to the plane. In that time the luggage was not unloaded from the plane, so another 20 minutes was wasted waiting for luggage to arrive at the baggage claim. After luggage was attained, I watched two ""long term"" busses pull away from the shuttle station at the same time. I then waited 35 minutes for one to come back to the pickup, by which time, I had created an account here and written this entire review and the shuttle still is not here. It arrived 38 minutes after leaving and both shuttles arrived at the same time. Poor planning and poor logistics by every department at the airport.",-1
2022-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,I will always try to avoid Baltimore from now on,True," This was the worst airport experience I have ever experienced! The wheelchair attendant pushed me to the Immigration line and left us, and never came back. My daughter had to push me and our carry-ons through customs. They never told us we had to get our luggage and take them with us to our connecting flight. So we had to wait for an attendant to bring our bags, this almost made us miss our flight. My daughter found a large raggedy cart that she placed our two large heavy suitcases on, then I pushed the cart while she pushed me. Then we walked not knowing where to go or how to check our bags because there was no workers around and this airport is very big. We did come across two police security officers who were of no help, we asked them to radio the airplane so that they would know we were on our way. They said no, they had no control over that and they were not affiliated with the airline. So we continued to struggle along and a man helped my daughter check our bags. Then finally we reached the plane and they were unaware we were even suppose to be there. I will always try to avoid Baltimore from now on.",-1
2022-03-07,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,1.0,this is the worst by far when it comes to customer service,True," Airline staff, TSA, and food workers all seem miserable.

After realizing that my mother was low vision, security staff still treated us rudely, trying to quickly usher us through their security system without much regard to her disability.",1
2021-12-01,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,personnel was friendly and very helpful,True, Parking-each spot marked with assigned numbers. Each elevator marked. Kiosk was convenient to get tag for luggage. Personnel at the desk was very polite and helpful. We then proceeded to security and a couple of employees on the way were helpful and responsive to direct us. I wasn’t a passenger but was allowed to take my mom on wheelchair straight to the gate (my documents were checked and security point passed). Security check line was long but organized. People in wheelchairs didn’t have to be in line. Officers were focused and informed us on each step in the process. Airport building is spacious and constantly being cleaned. We noticed people cleaning bathrooms and hall handles. At the gate personnel was friendly and very helpful! Order was maintained throughout our departure. Five stars!,1
2021-10-24,0.3,Business,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,3.0,I cannot believe the level of inefficiency,True," The rental car system here adds 30-45 min each time you go to the airport. I cannot believe the level of inefficiency displayed in this process. What clown decided to have the rental car lot 5 miles away? I will never, and I repeat, never, come back to this airport again. And I will be telling everybody I know.",-1
2021-10-05,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,customer service is horrible,False,  The customer service reps at gates A8 and A11 were very rude at Baltimore airport. Our flight in Manchester was delayed and our flight on to Nashville was delayed. I went up to both of them to ask questions because the flight number on our boarding passes were different. I only wanted to know if the flight number had changed because the flight number on our boarding passes on the screen said already departed. Our plane from Manchester arrived after the departure time. He kept arguing saying we missed our flight. No we did not miss our flight if it was delayed. He was a very rude and hateful man whom does not need to be dealing with the public. No reason for the hatefulness and rudeness. Very bad for business. Airport is very nice and well maintained but customer service is horrible. The lady at gate A8 would not even help us at all. She said I can’t help you and don’t know what to tell you. That’s terrible customer service. I usually fly into here but more than likely will not again. Very disappointed!,-1

Made me go through TSA lines twice and charged me an extra $30 to check a bag all because they did not like the fact that I had a souvenir inside of my bag. A bad experience and I will not be going back.,-1
2021-07-29,0.7,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,I am thoroughly unhappy with the service at this airport,False,"  I am thoroughly unhappy with the service at this airport. The removal of skycaps was a terrible disservice to your customers, especially those who are in need of assistance. My 93-year-old mother was brought a wheelchair to the ramp and told, ""Oh, I can't push her to baggage. Someone else will have to help you."" I had recently had a left hip surgery and had to push my mother in order to get down to the baggage area. How can an airport with this much traffic, not set up a contract to help with their customers in need of wheelchair assistance? Please consider hiring a group through a contract that can help with this service. Our senior population is neglected in so many ways and the airport should not be one of those places. I wish that you would consider addressing my concerns. Thank you.",1
2021-07-25,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,avoid this airport for future travel,False,"  Having been to many airports, I found BWI to be the worst customer friendly ever! Total chaos, and not very helpful staff (rude), when asking questions. TSA/Security were the worst, barking orders and talk to customers with total disrespect. I have never encountered such rudeness. We will surely avoid this airport for future travel.",-1
2021-04-14,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,,5.0,0.0,,,,has the absolute worst TSA system,True," Baltimore/Washington International Airport (Concourses D) has the absolute worst TSA system. There was not a designated Pre-TSA line and when I was asked to remove my shoes I told them I was Pre-TSA. The guy said ok, but a lady with a very nasty attitude told him no she needs to show her boarding pass but by this time my purse and phone with the boarding pass had already gone though the machine and they wouldn’t pass it back. Now keep in mind that I paid $85 not to remove my shoes and I wasn’t prepared so I was wearing shoes where I didn’t have on socks. But that’s not the point. The point is their system should be set up correctly for Pre-TSA customers. Then to make matters worse my purse had been pulled for extra checking and when they didn’t find me because I was being held up because of the shoes situation they made me wait while they checked others when I finally made it though the line and held me there for more than 5 minutes. Then found absolutely nothing in my purse. When he couldn’t find anything he took everything out to say that I was good. So back to my point. Baltimore/Washington International Airport (Concourses D) has the absolute worst TSA in my travels and I travel all over and a lot.",-1
2021-03-28,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Very unpleasant experience,False,"  One of the most annoying airports for two reasons. First the rudest and angriest airport workers I have ever seen. Second the rent a car experience is horrible, nothing telling you when you arrive that you need to takes shuttle bus to a special facility that is quite a distance away. Asking people working there where to go is not pleasant. Took a while to find one to tell me. Very unpleasant experience.",-1

It takes them forever even in TSA prechecked. You have to throw away hair products under 5 ounces. They don't even go by their own guidelines. Good luck if you have to fly, through this airport.",-1
2019-11-12,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,Worst rental car bus service,False,"  Worst rental car bus service. I am stopping all my company business travel through BWI. Busses do not come often enough for the traffic. Could not fit in two busses, then when I did they were packed in like sardines. Took a long time to get to rental car lot. On return missed my flight to do this.",-1

2019-09-23,0.5,Business,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,TSA employees are the nastiest,True,  I have been flying often for over 30 years mostly work related. I have utilized more than 55 airports in 10 countries both before and after 9/11. I have always loved BWI because it is very convenient for me. The TSA employees are by far the nastiest to traveling public than the security staff at any other airport. I truly believe the TSA staff at BWI actually hate the traveling public for making them work. Most obviously the way African American TSA employees interact with Non-Hispanic white travelers. This racist treatment toward Non-Hispanic whites extends beyond the TSA employees but most BWI employees down to and including the BWI parking shuttle bus drivers seem to have this hatred of people of light skin. I have not noticed the Airline direct employees acting in this manor what so ever.,1

",False,"  I arrived at the airport at 5:00am for a 6:20am flight. TSA only had checkpoint B open and A and C was closed for general boarding. There was an 45 min plus wait to get through. Oddly enough, checkpoints A and C were open for Clear customers. I missed my flight. So, if you pay extra for Clear, you get next level service even though I am already paying for TSA via taxes and fees. Not TSA’s finest moment. To be fair, I fly 4-7 times a month and this is the first time I have encountered today’s fiasco.",1
2019-04-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,,Worst luggage service,False, Worst luggage service from plane to terminal that I have ever encountered! It should not take 45 minutes for luggage to come off the plane into the airport! Our flight straight up disappeared off the carousel board and then another plane got their luggage before us. Not good service.,-1
2018-11-25,0.3,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,one of the worst,True,"  It’s amazing how the airport authority has taken one of the best business airports in the country to one of the worst. Rental cars are insane distance away. Then the walk to the rental car pick up shuttle is just as bad. TSA is slow and the agents care more about who did what last night than moving things along quickly. They are among the most unfriendly in the country. I always fly Southwest out of BWI. Either to there or changing planes. They also have the distinction of having the most unfriendly southwest agents working the gates. Attitude and could care less about customer service. If this hub changed I, as well as a great number of road warriors would welcome the change. I use other airlines as much as possibly now to avoid this airport. And you want attitude or poor customer service. Get a cab at the airport to one of the hotels in the hotel zone. Yeah, maybe i don’t want to wait in the weather for a shuttle bus. God Forbid. The cab drives are rude and will have meltdowns when you tell them where you are going. I tip hefty and would have done more for them than most...but not when they cop an attitude. Again, one of the least pleasant airports to fly into. Make it even better, utilize the end of Concourse C and no moving sidewalks.",-1
2018-11-16,0.3,Business,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,Disgusting bathrooms,False, Disgusting bathrooms and worst TSA I've ever seen. The TSA agents were completely unorginized and seemed far more worried about chatting and laughing with each other than screening passengers. I know bathrooms can get dirty quickly but with how disgusting the bathroom was I can't imagine it had been cleaned in days. One factor keeping me from relocating to or even wanting to travel to Baltimore is BWI.,-1
2018-10-11,0.4,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,,the worst when getting baggage,False, This is absolutely the worst airport when getting baggage after a flight. It takes at least half an hour every time we arrive except when on an extremely small airplane. We pay airport fees don't we? This has been the case every time we fly into the airport. We have priority baggage but it's disgusting because it never gets out earlier. Would it help to write our representatives in the US Congress or in Md? I am so disgusted with the lack of service at BWI. The airport is close by and it's not worth making the trek to Regan or Dulles. What can we do as passengers to improve this unacceptable situation?,-1

Now yes the A and B concourses for Southwest are very nice as is the rest of the airport, but arriving is the worst! It takes so long for luggage to arrive at the carousel that I receive my luggage quicker at Dulles arriving on an international flight with two or three times as many passengers!",1

Very long initial line moving very slowly, even though airport in general apparently not too busy. But then we were diverted to a different line that moved even more slowly while we watched many others who had been far behind us pass right on thru the other lines. TSA employees seemed totally indifferent and not interested in trying to improve the situation. Even our 10-year old son said, ""that was by far the worst airport security we've ever had."" What's going on BWI? Other airports seem to be doing much better.",-1

",False,"  I travel through this airport often, so I know from experience that the TSA, baggage handlers and other airport employees at Baltimore Washington International Airport are the rudest and most arrogant group that I have interacted with in this country and Europe. The worst part is that I come from this area and I am embarrassed by the terrible first impression that these people make on the millions of visitors that have had the misfortune to pass through this airport. Can't we do any better? How about a class on common courtesy?",-1
2018-05-14,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,4.0,work on their arrival process,True,"  Baltimore Washington is my home airport and generally I have no issues with it. That was my experience for the departure. Check in was a breeze. Actually, since Southwest accounts for 70% of the flights at BWI, if you are on another airline it is usually easy. We were flying British Airways. After check in we had a nice meal at Passports Bar and Grill which was right next to our gate. Finished our meal, got on the plane and flew! Easy! Then there was the return. Not as good. First, we stood in line to check in at the kiosks. Then we stood in line to go through customs. The flight had 200+ people on board and there were two agents to process us. It seemed like a long time. Then finally when we got our bags there was yet a third line to get outside. I honestly have no idea what that last line was for. I thought they were going to check our bags and bag receipts to make sure we had the right luggage, but when we finally got to the front of the line we were just waived through. BWI is expanding their international section with the plan to attract more international flights. If they do, they definitely have to work on their arrival process.",1
2018-02-23,0.1,Business,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,the worst airport I’ve ever been to,False,"  This was painfully the worst airport I’ve ever been to. First of all navigating through is all backwards. The staff are extremely rude. I went through TSA checkpoint and the guy working “forgot” he let me though when there was no one behind me and made me go through again. The bartender at the green turtle was hands downs the rudest bartender I’ve ever delt with. I then tried to just get fries from McDonalds and the woman taking my order didn’t smile, didn’t ask what she could get for me, just stared at me hanging / slouching over her computer. Lastly my flights were delayed three times. To get home I had to book a flight through another airline and I had 30 mins to walk out of the concourse and go back through security. When I got back in line was being yelled and had very inappropriate comments from the staff to me and felt extremely uncomfortable.

While the airport overall is about comparable to many of the others I frequent, the baggage service is among the slowest in any airport I fly through. It has never improved and I see many reviews complaining about this same fact. Why doesn’t BWI management care enough to correct this issue. They clearly don’t care!",-1
2017-12-13,0.3,Business,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,,"I am disappointed with this"" ",False,  The wait time for the security check today was atrocious. There was at most 50 people in the line and it took over 30 minutes to get through the check with only one lane open. Furthermore the TSA officers were not helping the line to move quickly. I am disappointed with this as I travel frequently and can get thru LAX in a faster time with 4 times as many people.,-1
2017-09-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,Not designed well for changing planes,False,  Not designed well for changing planes. No transportation between the terminals which makes it hard for older people or for those who have health issues. You can get places but you may be late and exhausted or both. I would book a fight not to change here. The powering stations for your electronics are cute but poorly designed to handle a lot of people. You get one if you are lucky. Free WiFi but you will probably have to ask someone how to get on. Some Gate wings have good restaurants with TV options but others do not. Put your Fitbit on walk and you can find lots of things and make your 10000 steps. Designed for the young and healthy.,-1
2017-08-30,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,fairly painless to navigate,False, Transited through Baltimore Washington twice with short layovers. A and B concourses are fairly painless to navigate. There were a decent number of places to eat and the rest rooms were clean. Not much else to say because there is a lot of this airport that I just didn't have the time or the need to use.,1
2017-07-13,0.6,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,longest of any airport that I visit,False,"  I live in the BWI area and have had many experiences similar to my July 12, 2017 flight from LAS-BWI. The time to retrieve your luggage is consistently the longest of any airport that I visit which is over 50 different airports. The airport itself gets a good rating except in the baggage handling area. The low rating for airport staff is specifically for the baggage handling department.",1

This is a fantastic airport. They have a great children's area, local pricing, plenty of charging stations, good eats, and it's clean. I can't vouch for security though because this was a connection for us. I didn't use the wifi either so I'm not sure how good that was.",1
2016-11-28,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,never had a bad experience,False,"  BWI is my ""home"" airport. I could also use DCA, but I prefer Baltimore. I have read some unfavorable reviews of this airport, but sometimes think that they must be talking about a different airport. I will say that this is a medium sized airport, so it will not have many of the same choices as the large airports. But I have used this airport for over 30 years and never had a bad experience. I have never experienced long delays at security. Usually five to ten minutes and you're through. One thing has recently changed that is a big improvement is the ability to move from one concourse to another post security. This was an issue in the past because Southwest handles about 70% of the flights to and from BWI, so the best food choices were in their areas. Now there are more choices no matter which concourse your airline is leaving from.",1
