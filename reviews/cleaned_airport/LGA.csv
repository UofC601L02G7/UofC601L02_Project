2023-10-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,,Restrooms are plentiful and clean,True," The new Terminal C is a significant improvement over the old Delta terminal. This is a spacious terminal with plenty of light from the floor to ceiling windows giving views of the airport runways/aprons and CitiField and Arthur Ashe Stadium. The walk from gate 75 to gate 97 was rather long. Restrooms are plentiful and clean; however, in some locations they could use more stalls given the number of passengers who traverse this terminal. Dining options are placed conveniently. I had a delicious lunch at one of the restaurants. The airport WiFi is very fast and worked flawlessly.",1
2023-06-18,0.8,Business,5,5,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,High marks for LGA new Terminal B,True,"  High marks for LGA new Terminal B. The building is spacious with plenty of light. Long walks from check-in to the gates and one has to walk through the  shopping mall to get to one's gate. Arrived on a Thursday at 7:00. Went to the TSA PRE line. There were about 20 people ahead of me but, with 4 stations open to check ID, the line moved quickly. Found myself in a too-slow security lane. People, why do you wait until you get up to the scanner to remove your watch, belt, jewelry, etc. Especially if you're in PRE, you know who this works! Still and all, I arrived at 7:00, checked luggage and was through security by 7:15. Not at all bad for this newly refurbished airport.",1
2023-05-31,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,no signage to speak of for Frontier,True,"  Absolutely no signage to speak of for Frontier, very hard to figure out where to go amongst all the Competitor airline signage, very difficult to find the terminal to go to, and the ticket agents and bag person was rude. The only thing going for this terminal was the security desk, they were nice, and the person behind the screener checking the people images was sort of funny, other then that everyone else i dealt with was rude.",-1
2022-10-18,0.4,Couple Leisure,3,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,4.0,Horrible experience,False," While arriving to La Guardia Terminal B from JFK after an international flight, we were too early to check in. There is no restaurant to relax in without going through security It was too early to check bags therefore could not go through security but had nowhere to have a drink & food & relax. Very few seats Those that we’re provided were backless benches. After a renovation it seems someone should have thought to provide food service for those arriving too early to check in. Horrible experience",-1
2022-09-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,Its bad reputation is well earned,False,"  Terrible signage, inefficient layout, understaffed. Its bad reputation is well earned. Not much else to say. Ridiculous that they are trying to renovate the airport but simply better signage would go a long way.",-1
2022-08-25,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Delta Terminal C is elegant, convenient and modern",True,"  The new Delta Terminal C is elegant, convenient and modern. Restaurants, gate areas, and restrooms were all immaculate. Check-in went smoothly. Keep it up.",1
2022-07-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,I will never fly through La Guardia again,False,"  I had a flight scheduled to leave a 6 in the morning connecting in La Guardia. Several delays and flight changes later, I finally managed to get on a plane, and then had to wait in the plane for another hour because La Guardia had shut down airspace. I will have to figure out another connecting flight because of this, and they made me check my carry on so God knows where that will end up. This has been a complete nightmare I will never fly through La Guardia again.",-1
2022-07-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a pathetic excuse for an airport,True," This has to be the worst airport I’ve ever been too. Not only is every terminal a 20 minute drive but the ‘shuttle service’ drops you half a mile from terminal C. Wait it gets better, you have to walk another mile once you get through security to get to gate 67 because they refuse to open a closer security checkpoint site. This is a pathetic excuse for an airport and honestly should be shut down.",-1
2022-07-14,0.9,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,The new terminal is unrecognizable and a huge improvement!,True," I hadn't flown from LGA in years and was very impressed with the new Terminal B (home to American Airlines and others). Beautifully designed, spacious, and easy to navigate with abundant dining and shopping opportunities. Check-in areas are spacious and efficient. Great rest rooms. The new terminal is unrecognizable and a huge improvement!",1
2022-05-18,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Don’t mind taking your money but don’t care if you get what you pay for,True," We flew from Dallas to New York where we had a lay over and changed planes before going to Portland Maine. We thought! However our flight to Portland was delayed several times and then cancelled late at night when shops closed. There were elderly people and handicapped people and some medical issues. No assistance was offered. The passengers stuck together and tried to help each other as much as possible. Had to ask for snacks and water but no wheelchairs, no blankets, no directions, just a lot of rudeness. We spent the night on the floor freezing in the airport, then next morning when trying to leave nothing but rudeness everywhere. Security screaming at deaf boy because they wouldn’t calm down long enough to realize or listen to us trying to tell them he was deaf. Eating places the same way. Don’t mind taking your money but don’t care if you get what you pay for and rude to boot. Check in very inefficiently run.",-1
2022-05-08,0.3,Business,1,4,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,constant delays with security,True, Multibillion dollar renovation at LaGuardia yet security with pre check takes 20 minutes? What’s the point? Never experienced such significant and constant delays with security.,-1
2022-05-03,0.1,Business,1,4,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,waiting for hours inside the airport,True,"  Upon landing and looking for a taxi I found this Appallingly inefficient scenario: There were ropes inside the airport lobby where people waited for taxis. Some people just skipped the line and went directly outside where they queued with the passengers who had waited for one hour while the other stranded people were inside still waiting. People in wheelchairs were set aside and automatically skipped the line. My wait for a trickling taxi was one hour. When I finally went outside to the next queue the waiting travelers inside had at least a 2 hour wait. The line inside the airport extended way outside the rope lines. People with children or pets were literally in deep trouble. The taxi cabs are not allowed to pick up passengers at the airport curb but are obliged to wait in a parking lot two miles from the airport and then fight traffic to get to curb and pick up a traveler. They make this long circle around the airport. There are hundreds of taxi cabs waiting in the lot. Causing hundreds of stranded travelers waiting for hours inside the airport. I would like to know the genius who created this mess so I could tell him/her what a dumb way to manage the taxi/passenger situation. With all the taxi cabs waiting in the parking lot causing the passengers to wait for hours in the airport instead of a quick turn over like in any other civilized country. It’s a disgrace and mismanagement of available taxis, time, airport disruption due to interminable lines and disgruntled passengers and extra fuel since the driver needs to travel fighting traffic to reach the terminal AGAIN. Besides that, think of the extra burden on the environment and the air we breathe, circling around like that for no reason whatsoever. Taxis are constantly needed, don’t keep them in a parking lot 2 miles from airport trickling in, like slow drops.",-1
2022-04-23,1.0,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,just the pleasantries that were needed,False,"  The customer service we received by American Airlines and TSA was amazing. I forgot my bag at a store in La Guardia when I purchased an item. We only realized it when we were outside! Well, we told a TSA agent what happened and they directed us to the security agent. She told me to ask AA for a gate pass and if not she would personally escort me back to the store. The AA agent was super nice and told me she would radio someone to walk me. She the asked for my receipt and contacted the store directly! TSA took over and sent someone to the store and brought out bag! Wow, this was just the pleasantries that were needed after an wonderful cruise.",1
2022-02-02,0.1,Business,3,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,Absolutely pathetic,False," What a complete joke - this is not a terminal, but a completely messed up construction zone. You will have to walk through mud, rain, snow and ice to get in and out of that terminal. There is not even a drop off without having to walk for 5-10 minutes through the complete mess. Once you made it to the ""terminal"", don't expect seating anywhere near the ""gate"". Also, don't expect the plane to be anywhere close to the construction zone that you have to enter to catch a flight. For that, you leave the building and walk and walk through the same weather, mud and rain that you experienced getting into that building. I have no idea why any airline in the world would assume that this was anywhere close to acceptable. Over the last 40 years, I have been flying with poor airlines into poor airports, but this is absolutely the worst and most unbelievable experience. For sure the last time that I flew with Delta Airlines, which is the only airline expecting their customers to accept walking through a muddy construction zone to use their ""service"". Absolutely pathetic.",-1
2021-11-13,0.6,Business,3,5,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,the design of the Terminal D is dreadful,False,"  While pretty, the design of the Terminal D is dreadful if you are a human who has to walk the half mile to the last gate. And if you forget, or need to use a restroom after you get to the gate, be prepared to hike back that half mile! Further sadness is the design flaw of the expansive windows. Pretty views, but no overhang and poor window tinting means I left the airport sunburned and sweating from the greenhouse-effect heat! Sunburned from sitting inside an airport? Crazy, but true. Lastly, LaGuardia is now the most expensive airport in the world to get a snack, try the $6 bottle of orange juice (that costs $0.50 wholesale, and $4 at other airports). Shame on NYC and Skanska Design.",-1
2021-09-17,0.5,Solo Leisure,4,3,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,is still very much a work in progress,True, It was the last leg of a long day traveling from JAC. The airport is undergoing a multi billion dollar renovation and is still very much a work in progress. Eating and shopping options are somewhat limited compared to other airports I was at on this trip. I was too tired and hungry to go exploring. There was only one monitor to check for departing flights at the far end of the C concourse. This was frustrating as my departure gate changed twice. The departing flight was stuck on the tarmac for about 45 minutes due to Air Traffic. Who knew that a late night departure from LaGuardia could get delayed waiting to take off?,-1
2021-04-19,0.4,Solo Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,,I was totally disappointed,True," I realize the renovation is not complete - but I am so disappointed that the layout doesn't seem to consider people who are not 20-30 somethings or athletes. The corridors going to the gates are excessively long and I see no plans for moving sidewalks. I am a ""normal"" 50 something with no disabilities and still found it to be a trek. If you're going to do something, why not do it right? I was totally disappointed. Nice advertising, nice fountain but really, I like convenience most.",-1
2020-09-27,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,TV’s are deafening,True," TV’s are deafening. Not all of us need to anesthetized by useless news. Make some quiet sections. Other then that, the terminal has improved immensely.",1
2019-11-14,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,4,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,Worst shuttle service I have ever seen,False,"  Worst shuttle service I have ever seen, out of many, and I want to stress up front that there was zero hustle in the the service people involved with the unacceptably-long shuttle time. My wife and I arrived at a high-numbered (no letter) gate and saw that we needed to get to gate 'D2'. After looking around in confusion and almost following a sign for D gate departures OUT of the airport, we figured out there was a shuttle between terminals (no signs for it that I saw). After a short walk, we got to a waiting line of shuttle passengers, some of which it sounded like they were waiting many minutes more. Another ten minutes later we were finally got on the shuttle, which took another ten plus minutes to get to our gate. Fortunately we had a reasonably-long layover to work with so we made our flight, another shuttle passenger was not so lucky. Also, at our gate the seating was very poorly laid out and cramped, yay. At least the staff at that gate showed some hustle to get us on the plane which was appreciated, my heart goes out to them.",-1
2019-10-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,will gladly pay more money to not stop at LGA,False,"  The worst airport experience I have had. Every flight to and from were delayed. They are clearly overbooking flights and can't handle the traffic. I missed my connection and have to pay for the hotel out of pocket because it was ""air traffic control"" issues and not weather related. They should't take in more flights than they're capable of handling. It took 45 mins to take a shuttle to go 2 terminals over because theres no traffic control for cars/buses. There so signs or info for which bus to take. The ""bus stops"" were overflowed with people waiting. And no help directing people. I will gladly pay more money to not stop at LGA.",-1
2019-09-24,0.1,Business,1,2,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,,easily the worst of them all,False,"  
I would say it is a third world experience but that is unfair to underdeveloped countries. I have been to plenty of airports around the world and LGA is easily the worst of them all. The traffic situation is a disaster and only gets worse. It never improves. This airport should be avoided if at all possible.",-1
2019-09-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,disgustingly filthy,False," Absolutely disgustingly filthy. Food and wrappers on floors and seats. Sticky armrests. Badly stained carpets. The concourse of arrival Monday, September 16, for flt 5469 Delta from YUL and departure # 3300 Delta to GRR were awfully uncared for. Several ""cleaners"" were there but not doing their jobs anything more than chatting. It was very disappointing as Delta has certainly lowered the bar for service/customer care. Also, the wheelchair was stained. You are asking for health problems with such inattention to hygiene. Is it incorrect to expect workers to work? Look presentable? Attend to expectations of cleanliness? Or am I just too old school?",-1
2019-08-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,food options were pathetic,True," This is by far the worst airport that I have ever had the displeasure of “visiting.” No one could tell us which gate our plane would be arriving at. It took over an hour of us walking around, asking every Delta employee to eventually know where we were to go. The food options were pathetic: almost every stand had the same pre-made sandwiches sitting around for purchase. But the worst of all was the hot serve-your-self options that were placed under heating lamps in the middle of walkways. Passing travelers were free to touch and stir the food trays, but most did not even buy! All I could think about was the massive amount of global germs that would be deposited in each dish! To make matters even more depressing was the pan handle-like atmosphere where airport employees were harassing travelers to sign up for American Express credit cards. Some became indignant when we refused due to time restraints. One told me, “Ahh, come on, you got time, your plane isn’t leaving until 2.00!” Sadly, however, he or no one else, would help us locate our gate. My husband and I had to be detectives and do our own footwork to locate our plane’s eventual arrival gate. Finally, the “icing on the cake” would be the rock-hard stale doughnuts I purchased out of desperation after throwing away my pricey, cold, bland ham and cheese sandwich encased in a soggy roll, layered with smooshed tomatoes and wilted lettuce! Imagine eating that mess of a meal while looking at the horribly stained and filthy grey carpet and praying that you are hopefully at the right gate of departure. I say throw the whole airport away and start again. We, the customers, deserve a whole lot better.",-1
2019-08-18,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,avoid LGA no matter,False,  We arrived 1.5 hours before our flight. We spent 30 minutes in line to check in with United and the next 40 minutes getting through TSA. It was 4:45am on a Sunday morning. We barely made the gate before they closed it. I am not sure how an airport can operate so inefficiently. Lesson learned. It is worth an extra amount of money to avoid United at all costs and to fly JFK and avoid LGA no matter how good a deal it may be.,-1
2019-08-12,0.2,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never go to this airport again,True,"  My 18 year old son and two 17 year old friends were at Lagardia this morning over three hours before flight. The security check-in line was very long. After over 1 hour they got to the metal detectors and were told the phone or phone scanners were down and told the boys they would need to go get a paper ticket printed. They did this and of course by then the flight had departed. The airline would not help our boys and they are right now stranded in New York. We have scrambled to get them a hotel. This is shameful, and would never go to this airport again.",-1
2019-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,they were confrontational and hostile,True," First time travelling through La Guardia, my wife is 17 weeks pregnant and both of us are serving military. Only scanners were being used at security screening, my wife and I were concerned with harm to our baby, so she tried to opt-out of the scanner to do a pat-down instead. Security staff were immediately demeaning towards her, pushed her to the side of the scanner without offering direction. I had to stand on the other side of security watching helplessly while my pregnant wife was forced to stand in the open, without shoes, for almost 10 minutes until I questioned staff on my side. Employees never gave a clear explanation, and the employee she had initially spoken to just walked off without communicating the opt-out to her co-workers. Any time I questioned staff, they were confrontational and hostile towards me. When my wife finally got a pat down the employee verbally demeaned her, chastised her for not following directions, even though directions were not given. TSA guidelines clearly state that an opt-out of scanners is not meant to punish people, but my pregnant wife was embarrassed and felt like she was being punished. Shame on the security staff for being so ignorant and unprofessional. We will never ever visit this airport again if we can help it.",-1
2019-07-31,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,still continues to be the worst airport,False, La Guardia still can’t get one simple thing right. One has to wait 30mins to go from Term B to C or D. The most minimal amount of common sense would be to allow people to walk from C to B but instead you have to wait 30-40mins which means a missed flight for sure. Ridiculous and is why still continues to be the worst airport - 3rd world airport is an understatement.,-1
2019-06-11,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,departure is a mess,False,"  Arrival was uneventful, but departure is a mess. Going through security, the clear company was putting 10 and 12 people at a time at the front of the line, the TSA agent had to take his word for who was clear, they had two lines going to the same bin line instead of opening up another one. No one knew if they were supposed to go through metal detector for the scanner so they were getting mad at those in the wrong line, after getting through people were grabbing the wrong bins with the security guard standing there watching and not helping another passenger who had her laptop taken. Really miss managed. Then you pay $17 at bar brace for a sandwich that is the nastiest thing you ever will eat. I'll try Newark next time.",-1
2019-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,,inconvenience and mismanagement,True," My experience at La Guardia was beyond the most horrific I have ever experienced in an impoverished third world country. I have been through airport construction projects in numerous airports and none remotely approached the inconvenience and mismanagement at La Guardia. None, nowhere. Communication was nonexistent or worse, incomprehensible. I will select a few examples from this nightmare just to illustrate. We landed hours late because of weather (to be fair, no fault of the airport). It was almost midnight. We followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs until, finally, at the end of the terminal, far from the usual curbside, we at last found the taxi stand. Or so we thought. The long line waiting for taxi was actually not waiting for taxis at all, but for the bus, to take us to the taxis. Taxis were not allowed at the terminal. So we waited in torrential rain for the bus, which eventually took us to another place where we waited in the rain for a taxi. For our return, I had rented a car and had to drop it off. Unlike any other airport, there were no signs directing you to the rental car return. Fortunately or so I thought I knew my way around. I headed through a maze of construction to the place car dropoffs had been for decades . All but 2 had to move because of the construction. There were no signs or any communications informing you where to go. I asked a police officer, who kindly sent me in the wrong direction. GPS didn’t work. Finally, we found the virtually unmarked dropoff. I asked why there were no signs anywhere directing people to the new dropoffs. He responded, incredibly, that “we are not allowed to have signs off the airport”. We waited for the shuttle bus only to find out that the shuttle bus had to take us to another shuttle bus. During construction, car rental companies, who could not have signs off the airport, were not allowed to have shuttles on the airport. I know construction creates inconvenience, but the experience was a horrific nightmare not an inconvenience and I place full 100% blame on management, customer disregard, and complete incompetence in planning. As the saying goes, only in NY. “",-1
2019-04-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0, a third world airport,True,"  You’ll spend 45mins to an hour trying to get to departures or arrivals or waiting for a pickup. They do not care at all that they have screwed the traffic situation beyond comprehension! Who plans an $8B renovation and doesn’t plan for traffic? I’m born and raised in NY and I’ve watched this airport go from horrible to absolutely insufferable! Do yourself a huge favor go to JFK and stay as far away from the hellhole that LGA has become. There’s no food or coffee or even clean bathrooms in the airport, And you’ll spend an hour from when you exit the expressway at the airport trying to go a half mile to the terminal or if arriving wait an hour for your ride to travel a half mile to get you. Avoid at all costs. Thanks LGA for reminding me why I never fly here. Its a third world airport.",-1
2019-04-24,0.4,Solo Leisure,4,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,nowhere to purchase hot coffee,False,  I was picking up my daughter and there was nowhere to purchase hot coffee in the baggage claim or check in area. This is unacceptable in today’s world where there is a Dunkin Donuts every mile. They should add a coffee stand immediately.,-1
2019-03-10,1.0,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,a few kind New Yorkers,True,"  I’m a blur right now, exhausted, but happy as I sit at LGA waiting to fly home to Florida. It takes chaos to help us recognize peace. I lost my phone after I got to the airport this morning, in the security or it fell out of my coat. Rushing up to the security, a few kind New Yorkers working at security helped me ping my iPhone with my Apple Watch, called it, helped me look on the ‘find my phone’ app and even ran my bags through the closed line to see if they could see it on X-ray just to be sure. Just about then the tears starting coming, thinking I couldn’t board my plane and get home. Home sounded pretty darn good about now. All of a sudden the New York hero swoops in holding an I-phone, that suspiciously looks like mine, and proclaims “someone found an I-phone”. I took the phone, uttered a million thank yous. That didn’t seem quite enough and I hugged Mr Hero. Still overcome with gratitude, I threw my hands up in the air and shouted “ I love New Yorkers”. The security guard confirmed it “New Yorkers are really nice people”. With that, I walked away with my happy ending thanks to the heart of New York... it’s people.",1
2019-02-24,0.1,Business,4,4,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,This place is a nightmare,False,"  Please, please, please, when you upgrade this airport, be sure to eliminate all off the euro Cibo garbage and bring back normal restaurants and shops that everyone much prefers. Also, we all have smartphones in our hands so please also get rid of all the little used iPads cluttering up every single surface of the terminal. This place is a nightmare.",-1
2019-01-23,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Do yourselves a favor and avoid,False," Do yourselves a favor and avoid having to fly through LaGuardia at almost any cost. First off, I have been to much better run airport in most 3rd world countries. They have made somewhat of an attempt to ""modernize"" some terminals, but it still requires catching a shuttle from one terminal to the other, where the transfer station signage is almost as bad as the attitude and organization of the staff who are responsible for running and coordinating the shuttles. I literally missed a connection because of the inefficiency of having to go from one terminal, to the other, and I had 45min to do so. Also gates are often switched at the last minute due to staffing and scheduling issues which forces you onto the archaic shuttle system between terminals. Oh, and also while I was here, a water pipe burst at the entrance to one terminal, which facilitated the need to again bus everyone on said shuttle system to another terminal, just so they can exit the airport.",-1
2018-12-08,0.1,Business,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,3.0,incompetence and customer disregard,True," It took 45 min from the time I entered my uber ride in the designated passenger pickup area in the parking garage to the time the car left the garage on to the streets. Even with the effects of construction, this experience/agony (and it is not the first time) is a result of incompetence and customer disregard by whoever designed this traffic organization. The traffic wardens inside the garage appear lost, disoriented and overwhelmed. I can only wish NYC mayor and the CEO of Port Authority were with me in the car to see with their own eyes what mess their incompetent lazy underlings have created with the traffic situation at the terminal as well as with car pickup protocol.",-1
2018-12-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,excruciatingly hot,True, I am sitting in Terminal B at Gate D6 as I write this review. It is excruciatingly hot. I mean everyone is complaining and the American Airline gate employee says nothing to be done just deal with it it the entire terminal. I love AA and write great reviews and letters about its staff all the time but this AA employee needs more training or termination. And if LaGuardia doesn’t realize that people are getting sick because of this heat then they need new facilities employees. I wish I could add a picture of the airline employees in tank tops. This is crazy. People are also sitting in the floor and standing also because of too few seats. LaGuardia please get it together.,-1
2018-11-27,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Should be shut down,False,"  
Just a lost cause. Should be shut down. Can’t handle any part of travel experience. This is a place beyond redemption or repair. Can’t handle incoming flights never gates like they didnt know we where coming. Departures always delayed with no information. Place is filthy and other services are the worst. Time to make this a hotel or housing development or Parking lot. Wait it is a parking lot.",-1
2018-11-13,0.1,Business,2,2,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Whatever happened to communication,True," Whoever thought the iPads to order at the terminal was a good idea. For a start they were not charged. Had to wait to get served and the service was appalling. Whatever happened to communication “Have a nice day”, “can l help you sir”? It is so impersonal and takes longer to work out than it would to actually serve a person. If l ever see the iPads on a bench I will walk, no, run to where I can actually get served get a receipt and tip someone.",-1
2018-11-12,0.8,Business,5,4,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,A great convenience,True," The terminals at La Guardia are undergoing a massive makeover - hence the immediate approaches look daunting; it is also outdated in terms of decor and available services. However, this airport, given that it serves the needs of New Yorkers travelling to points east of the Mississippi, and Canada, is extremely convenient. A short taxi ride brings you to the airport. The distance from the entrance to the gates is very, very short. Thus, you save a lot of time. From being dropped off at the entrance gate of the terminal to the TSA check area, it is less than a one minute walk - if you have your boarding pass with you. The gates are immediately thereafter. I am sure once the new terminals are constructed, the walks will be long and I will have to trudge long distances to my gate. I used Terminal B for a United flight from Gate C9. C9 is at the end of the terminal pier. So this is a very convenient, straight forward, quick terminal to use. In less than 5 minutes, including TSA inspection I was at my gate! I did not check any bags. Ample seating and quite a few electric connections to charge your phones all around. At this end, with the large glass windows, not only is the waiting areas bright, thanks to natural light streaming in, you can see flights landing and taking off. I was given TSA pre-check and going through the security inspection was a quick walk in the park. I did not have to pull out my laptop or liquids or even shed my coat or remove my footwear; I had put the phone in my bag. Food stalls after TSA are few but basic snacks and sandwiches are available. A little bit of research before coming to the airport can help travelers prepare for the services available and thus manage expectations. While the airport currently handles more traffic and passengers than it was built for, this is the airport where you can be at your gate from arriving at the terminal in just a few short minutes. A great convenience to busy, on the go New Yorkers!",1

",True," La Guardia is the worst airport I have ever flown into and out of. The airport is extremely mismanaged and lacks quality customer experience. We witnessed an elderly woman who was being assisted by one airport associate drop her 3 bags at the bottom of the escalator and told that she needed to go upstairs but lacked the ability to get all of her bags up the escalator herself. She then had to flag down a police officer to ask another associate to assist her who then loaded her bags and brought them up on the elevator for her as the first associate should have done. The signs throughout the airport contradict each other offering opposite directions for where the public transportation and the uber/Lyft pick up is located. Multiple water fountains aren’t even functioning, among other things. The traffic flow is confusing and disorganized causing massive arrival and departure delays. Truly an overall disappointing and poor experience.",-1
2018-09-18,0.1,Family Leisure,2,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Absolutely atrocious airport,False," Absolutely atrocious airport. How people are able to get through TSA without wanting to stop and get into an altercation with an agent is beyond me. The rudest and most disrespectful employees I’ve ever come across in any airport; and I’ve traveled to 4 continents and 35+ countries. LaGuardia, please get your personnel in order and under control. Side note, I did meet 3 awesome employees at Hudson News, 5 Guys, and 1 security worker at Terminal B. Aside from that - nah, I will pay immensely to avoid this place at all costs moving forward.",-1

The staff here were very nice compared to usual airport staff. The food court is modern and has great and healthy choices. There’s an airport link that is super convenient. I’m actually excited to fly to and from La Guardia again!,1
2018-06-09,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,unwilling to assist the passengers,False,"  The departing gate is not big enough to accommodate the passengers. It is dirty and the Spirit staff are rude, obnoxious and unwilling to assist the passengers. Mostly interested in how they could catch passengers trying to board with larger carry on bags than allowed. Instead of being trained to offer customer service, they are trained to generate extra income for Spirit Airlines. Spirit Airlines is all about the money!",-1

We had asked four different people before someone finally told us and by the way that was another customer not even one of the staff members at LaGuardia. As we were going through the airport the gentleman that was taking my mothers wheelchair pushed her into an object and in to me which was absolutely unacceptable.,-1

Security was a huge wait. Arrived at airport two hours before my flight and made it with minutes to spare. It's like a horrible maze designed to make you miss your flight.

Why would an airport ever have one vendor for the entire airport. That is absolutely outrageous. There is absolutely zero competition and horrible selections for full blown gouging prices. Can you believe a food court with different places, all owned by the same company, ridiculous. $6 for a slice of pizza. $7 for a bag of candy and a drink. $12 for a small sandwich. Absolutely outrageous. This company should be completely fired and removed from this airport immediately. The food at this airport is a total scam.",-1

It’s time to modernize LGA - New Yorkers deserve better!,-1

",False,"  La Guardia is a disgrace to this thing we call airports. Advertised $4 hot dog? Useless iPads will clear that up for you! $12 for a hot dog. Over $20 for a full meal. No restaurants for people who want something quick and cheap, and even the stores that sell fast snacks had terrible selection (they don't even sell Doritos). Literally every flight was delayed: we were misinformed multiple times about the extent of our delay, about whether or not we were waiting on another aircraft to arrive or if they were going to use a different aircraft. The WiFi is ridiculously expensive, hence the urge to write a terrible review during your free complimentary 30 minutes of wifi before you are kicked off and forced to pay! But, if wasting your own hard earned money and valuable time doesn't bother you, then you'll absolutely love this airport!",-1
2017-12-15,0.1,Business,3,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,This is a terrible airport,True," What moron thought up the airport bus system to rental cars.

NYC should shut it down, tear it down, and start all over.",-1
2017-12-05,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,everything falling apart,False," La Guardia airport is a total zoo. When I flew back in 2014 it was a disaster, 3 years later nothing has changed. When AA took over US Airways they got Terminal C which is where the legacy US Airways routes including flights to Charlotte depart. Terminal C is awful, very small, limited food options and very little seating, the AA side of the terminal is bland while the Delta side is a lot nicer with iPads (with almost no apps) set up. Airport is very very old and very dirty and everything seems to be falling apart. Expect your flight to be delayed out of LGA flight rarely leave LaGuardia on time. Our flight ended up leaving 45 minutes late, check-in was super slow and so was security, most of the staff are completely clueless and have no idea what is going on. When arriving in LaGuardia they gave us the wrong carousel for our bags and after waiting 30 minute we finally found them at a different carousel on the other side of arrivals and the airport staff had absolutely no idea! While JFK and Newark can also have quite a bit of problems LaGuardia seems to be one of the worst, so avoid!",-1

The food was extremely over priced. $4 for toast and $5 for water. Very upsetting but the good thing was that my flight departed on time. When I got back on Monday, I had a much better experience. The moment I got to the taxi line, the dispatcher got me a taxi and I was on my way.",1

There is a lot of traffic due to the exterior color metrication. The TSA pre-check was fast. Once in the terminal there are a few restaurants and a couple of stores. Food and beverage prices are a little high, your typical airport prices. The airport crew can be a little nasty and not helpful. They didn't allow me to start inside the terminal as my flights kept on being canceled and got stranded there for 3 days. The construction means that some areas are closed, and everything feels right.",-1

2017-07-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,woman is still there doing nothing,False,"  Friday July 21. I arrive at the airport to meet my daughter and her 3-year-old son. Their Spirit flight from Chicago is arriving at least one hour late. I am told the only place to wait for arriving passengers is near baggage claim. There is a woman there, apparently doing nothing, in a kind of uniform wearing a badge reading something like ""passenger assistant"". I ask her where to find an arrivals monitor. She laughs and says: ""there are no such monitors here"". I ask where to find them elsewhere, she says ""there are only departures monitors"". I express my surprise, she keeps laughing and she says ""this is how this airport is right now"". Then I ask her to please find information about Spirit 630, she laughs again and says ""it's impossible"". Then I wander about the airport, finally spotting, on the floor above, an arrivals monitor. The arrival appears to be imminent, so I go downstairs not to miss my daughter. Of course I still don't know whether the plane has landed. The woman is still there doing nothing.",-1

We were through security in less than 10 minutes. The A gate area is small, but there was seating for all and food options available with short queues at 6.30am.

Our 5-hour layover at La Guardia Airport was very unpleasant. We were in the B Terminal for the entire layover. The women's restroom had only 1 stall, the wait was long, & the only sink was clogged & already half-filled with ""used"" water. We were subjected to a dirty terminal, as well as having to breathe plane fumes in what was already a stuffy & poorly ventilated waiting area/corridor. Until such time as we receive confirmed evidence that this airport has been upgraded & cleaned up, we will not be choosing flights that either arrive or depart from this extremely poorly maintained facility.",-1

I arrived at La Guardia airport in American / Delta terminal and had to wait 50 minutes to meet my colleague flying in on a separate flight. There is nowhere to sit - period. When I enquired I was told by an airport employee that all seating was taken out due to the homeless population. As a traveler who has paid for a flight into NY that should not become my burden. I am saddened by the homeless population but I am a senior citizen north of 60 and to not have a place to sit seems unhealthy and unreasonable.",-1
2016-09-30,0.5,Business,4,4,,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,parking buses are inconsistent and sporadic,False," I understand that the parking is difficult and you have to leave at least another hour plus. The buses are so inconsistent and sporadic at La Guardia that the system is in disarray. Upon our arrival for our first flight the bus we needed was no where to be found. Another bus radioed the correct bus and no answer. He was nice enough to bring us close to our terminal since we waited over 40 minutes. If this driver didn't help us we probably would have missed our flight. Upon our return the same senerio happened- no directions and every employee we asked hadn't a clue. We waited 40 minutes and the driver stops and talked to everyone he knows bringing the trip to retrieve our car close to a hour and 10 min. The airport should institute and educate directions to their employees and have signs for where to go. Airport staff as far as TSA, American Airlines staff and the Hudson news staff were excellent. This isn't our first time parking since construction. Once the parking issue is complete it will be seamless like prior to the construction.",1
