2023-07-26,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,Ridiculous long wait for bags,False,"  Airport was nice, however very long walk from arrival gate to baggage claim. Ridiculous long wait for bags to arrive on carousel. We flew from Dallas to Cincinnati, the flight was a bit over two hours, it took nearly that long (just under two hours) for our bags to arrive in baggage claim. The person at the baggage desk was not able to provide any information about the status of the bags. We had trackers on them and could see they were sitting at a different terminal for well over 90 minutes after our arrival. Talking to other passengers and the Uber driver, apparently this is very common. We were told the airport is expanding operations, without upgrading infrastructure or adding staff to handle the extra traffic. If you have appointments shortly after you arrive plan on being late.",-1
2023-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,It was very unorganized,True,"  At Arrival, it took an excessive amount of time for my luggage to arrive at the claim area. At departure, there was a minimal line (when we got there) at TSA being funnelled into 2 open lanes (2 out of 10!) . The open lane we were put into hardly moved, as all wheelchairs and ClearPass passengers were moved in ahead of the line, rather than having their own independent lane for scanning & baggage check. Then the luggage machine broke, and we stood there for 20 minutes, until one worker finally decided to more the line over to the next machine. It was very hot in this area and after waiting almost 90 minutes to get through I felt nauseous. It was very unorganized and of all the airports I have flown through, never have I had these issues.",-1

2019-05-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Busses were non existent,True, Horrible time waiting for valupark. Busses were non existent. When they did come they packed us in like sardines. They claimed it was due to construction but I had seen 3 fast pass busses before I had seen 1 valupark bus. Then when I inquired upon if they had any extra busses with a airport employee. He stated it was due to work being done. Next time go with fast pass if you don't want to wait.,-1
2019-04-11,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,5.0,an employee named Karen,True,"  I want to recognize an employee named Karen. I first ran into her while leaving the Thrifty Car rental shuttle & entering the hallway to the ticketing/check in area & she saw that I was crying....she kindly stopped & asked if I was okay...her kindness made my cry more but in a wonderful way, if that could make any sense at all but very true. This sweet girl took my bags & insisted she carry & drag them for me to the check-in, asking if she could do anything to make things better for me or help me in any way, she would. I opened up & she listened, still pulling my luggage & carrying another bag of mine. Who does this?? A super person like her, that's who. Karen went above & beyond in her representation of Cincinnati Airport & I'm hoping whom ever reads this will go the extra mile, as Karen did & find her last name & get this to her manager. It's stories like this that we need to report & in my opinion, as important as a complaint. Please help this get to the correct department so credit is given to this very special employee. Thank you Karen for your kindness.",1
2018-12-12,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,5.0,its all about the money,False,"  If you are handicapped and bringing another handicapped person to this airport, make sure you bring someone else to babysit your car while you are getting the other handicapped person into the airport. I am recovering from stage 4 throat cancer and brought my 92 year old mother here for a flight to Phoenix, while taking her in and the car sitting with the handicapped sticker in the windshield, yep they ticketed it after being told by airport personnel to leave it and get her inside it would be ok. But we do understand its all about the money. People do not have a conscious these days, they are greedy here and that is sad.",-1
2018-10-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,"50 minutes to get bags""
",False,"  Why does it take 50 minutes to get bags at the baggage claim for a flight that arrived at 1.05 am? Are they so busy with the one flight that arrived at that time? Absolutely, unacceptable!",-1
2018-06-29,0.4,Business,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,2.0,extremely rude and unprofessional,False,"  I fly from CVG (Cincinnati/NKY International Airport) frequently, for business and pleasure. My airport experiences are typically normal, with few issues, with the exception of the departure traffic attendants. They are extremely rude and unprofessional. They yell and do not give you adequate time to drop someone off and pull out of your parking location. There is no need to be unprofessional and unfriendly. I would not recommend this airport.",-1
2018-06-26,0.4,Family Leisure,4.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,signage is not adequate,False,"  Beware of navigating this airport by motor vehicle. The signage is not adequate for those unfamiliar with the airport traffic patterns. The worst violation is the sign at the cell phone exit into the airport. The road consists of four lanes, two for arrivals or departures, the other two for commercial vehicles and exiting the airport. The sign for this pattern is overhead at the exit from the cell phone lot so you just have to guess and take your chances. Navigating out and back is sketchy. What were they thinking?",1
2018-06-26,0.7,Family Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,5.0,security moves pretty fast,False,"  Airport is nice, security moves pretty fast and it doesnâ€™t get too crazy busy like most airports. The only problem I have had is with the employees that work in the Starbucks near concourse B. They treat their customers with the upmost disrespect, and the store is always filthy. These people chose to work at an airport Starbucks, and get paid to be there but act like every customer is a burden. You guys should really do more research on the employees before you hire them.",1
2018-06-21,0.9,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,they are a really nice airport,False,"  Cincinnati was one of the best airports I have ever been to. It was the cleanest airport and the bathrooms were especially clean. The staff were very nice and they very helpful when my flight was cancelled. The concessions there are ok, and they could be better. But the choice of their airlines are just horrible. They have they worst airlines ever. Overall, they are a really nice airport.",1
2017-07-12,0.6,Business,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,1.0,satisfaction has been slowly declining,False,"  I'm a frequent business traveler that has flown from Cincinnati an average of 3 times per month for the last 4 years. My satisfaction has been slowly declining over the past year. Two things that stand out during this trip are: 1) The line for pre-check was reconfigured recently to make passengers take an unnecessarily long walk in a circle to get to TSA. When multiple passengers did the logical thing and just ducked under the rope, they were scolded by TSA and the TSA agent said ""We wish they would reconfigure it too, but you can't duck under"". It should not be that hard for airport staff to occasionally check and reconfigure the line to accommodate the current volume of passengers. 2) The only quality food option in concourse B has been Outback, but their quality of service has been declining over the past year as well.",1
2017-04-03,0.5,Business,1.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,a pleasant experience,False,"  Overall, Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky airport provides a pleasant experience and departing is not an issue. However, I have arrived at this airport twice in the past three weeks and an extremely aggravating problem has developed. Once you arrive at baggage claim, wait times to receive your checked luggage are ridiculously long. Today, I only had to wait 45 minutes and felt lucky because 3 weeks ago I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to get my bag. In both cases luggage from a dozen or so flights were being delivered to a single carousel around which several hundred very annoyed passengers were milling. There were typically gaps of 5 to over 10 minutes between arrival of new ""flights"" of luggage. I am not sure if this is a staffing problem, incompetence, or negligence, but if this trend continues I would recommend flying in and out of Dayton.",-1
