2021-10-20,1.0,Family Leisure,5,5,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,That is excellent customer service,True, I have flown from Charlotte NC to Pittsburgh many times in the past 14 yrs. Today I lost my wallet. I was very fortunate to be called informing me someone had turned in my wallet. They kindly sent an employee up to gate B32 to return it to me just minutes before my flight took off. That is excellent customer service and I will be forever grateful for their kindness. I will never forget this. Thanks for such a wonderful and caring staff. You guys rock!,1

",False,"  The line to go through TSA security checkpoint was literally outside into the tunnel. It took 45 minutes to get through security checkpoint alone. Considering it is 5 am on national turn your clock forward day with only a handful of flights, there must’ve been three dozen people in line complaining that they were going to miss their flight. I missed my flight, because of horrible personnel management. There were plenty of individuals standing around they could’ve very easily opened the optional check point.",-1
