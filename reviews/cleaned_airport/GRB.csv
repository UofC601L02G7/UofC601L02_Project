2018-02-02,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,5,5,5,2,1,,5,ample seating space,True," This is a small yet spacious airport, with two terminal piers jutting out in a Y shape. There were ample seating space, plug points to charge your phones, and also an enclosed section with desks and chairs to do any work on your computer. Large glass windows afforded views of the runways and let sunlight stream in. Bathrooms clean. TSA security was thorough. Check in counters are opened a couple of hours before a flight and I found the staff friendly. Car rental booths are in the baggage conveyor belt section and long term parking is just outside the terminal as are the parking lots for rental cars - minimal walking required. Very easy and fast entry and exit into/out of terminal. Driving directions to airport were clearly marked. Only a couple of shops/stores for food and drinks. A selection of Wisconsin beer was available in the restaurant but not my favorite, Leinenkugel! Overall, a very pleasant airport.",1
