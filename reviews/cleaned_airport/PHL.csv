2024-09-19,0.4,Family Leisure,2,4,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,“very confusing to navigate”,False," I found Philadelphia International Airport very confusing to navigate. Fortunately, we had requested wheelchair assistance for my mum who has limited mobility. The guy Cordell who helped us was friendly, approachable and kind which made our experience so much more pleasant!",-1
2024-08-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,"scanner was obviously malfunctioning"" ",False,"   I was subjected to a very intimate search three times by two different TSA agents. The scanner was obviously malfunctioning. How do I know? Well, I was clean but it kept saying I wasn't.  Then, walking on the tarmac to the plane, a baggage handler insisted that I had to ""valet"" my carry-on bag. Once inside, seeing the mostly empty luggage bays, I complained to the flight attendant. She went and brought the bag to me with apologies Arrival was okay, but the I had to follow a ""bread crumb"" trail of corridor, stairs and turns -- all with inadequate signage. Eventually I arrived at two luggage bays and was (at first) relieved to see my flight posted as ""unloading."" But it turned out that we did not get our luggage in hand for 1hr 50mins. No information from the uncommunicative employee in the Baggage Office. She said they were trying to find the agent to ""see if he has any more bags."" (I'm being generous here). She told me to scan a lost baggage claim code -- which did not work.",-1
2024-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,4,2,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,,no peace or calm between flights,False," They play non stop super LOUD ads at the gates while you wait. That with the combination of fluorescent lights, It creates the absolute worst atmosphere that you can imagine. There’s no peace or calm between flights while you wait.",-1
2024-08-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,cleanliness of the gate was atrocious,False,  I have been waiting in terminal b gate b8 since 4pm 8/19/24 for a flight which has been delayed 4 times and by 7 and 1/2 hrs. No information given over the speakers as to any changes. We have to constantly check the app. No airline attendants at the gate at all to ask any questions. (This is for aa flight 437). The lounge air was freezing and people were not prepared for that. Also the food areas that the airport offers in this section have no prices in the menu and he. You look it up online who the heck is paying $25 for a burger. Not even in London airports are they that expensive. And the cleanliness of the gate was atrocious. No one came by to clean up the trash all over the floor. It just seems like the airport did not care enough to provide good customer service. And the airline was a joke in giving us current information over the speaker system. I am rating this a 2/10 and that is generous!,-1
2024-06-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,1,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,,cleanliness is embarrassing,True,  Over an hour wait for a gate. Seems like it happens every time. Apart from the wait - the condition of the public restrooms and general cleanliness is embarrassing. The Philly airport aligns with Philly’s nickname - Filthadelpehia - why can’t we be better than this? Ideas - larger bathroom stalls so an individual traveling by their self can enter with their luggage? Warm water and soap to wash hands. Sensors that actually work and stay on while you are washing. Better coordination of empty gates. Clean more frequently. Power wash the exterior - gum and cigarette butts everywhere - yuck Ban smoking within 200 yards of the terminal Plant flowers,-1
2024-05-24,0.3,Family Leisure,2,1,2.0,4.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,such deplorable conditions,False,"   Specifically Terminal C: ladies rooms were filthy dirty and smelled terribly. Gate lounges were dirty and no trash picked up. Quick food place by gate 19 had gross looking sandwiches behind case, husband saw worker touch garbage then pick up slices of ham without washing his hands. Workers, including stores, restaurants, airline workers had bad attitudes, some not even acknowledging you spoke to them or asked a question of them. I have honestly never seen such deplorable conditions at an airport, hope basic manners and cleanliness return soon.",-1
2024-04-26,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,"shocked at how few seats there were"" ",True,"   My first impression of this airport was the huge queue for passport control. I counted three desks open for hundreds of arriving passengers, it took around an hour to get to the front where I was greeted by a surly immigration officer. No smile, no ""hello"", just barking demands. Once I was through that I needed to change terminal to get my connection to Knoxville, which led to another problem, a distinct lack of signs. Eventually I found the shuttle bus and proceeded to security where a female employee was screaming, actually screaming at passengers. I overheard another employee ask her to dial it down but she ignored him and continued the screaming. Brilliant. Eventually made it to my gate only to find there was a distinct lack of seating, with people standing here there and everywhere. On my return trip I was heading to LHR on an AA 787, and was shocked at how few seats there were at the gate. Overall, it's a big airport with the staffing levels and seating provision of a small airport which also assumes passengers know the airport inside out and don't need signs to get where they need to be.",-1
2024-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,"Worst airport, worst service",False,"   Me and my son arrived from Doha via American airlines on April 20, 2024 at 2:55 pm. We had a connecting flight Air Canada same day at 4.35PM. We had to pick up our bags and go thru security check again. They sent us thru a second Agriculture security check. We begged them that we are Canadian citizens but they would not allow us to bypass the queue for inspection of bags. We missed our onwards flight. We dropped of our bags after security and bags left for Toronto on April 20 and we were left behind. We check into a hotel as there was no night flight, bought new American Airlines tickets and left on April 21 at 8.35am.We lost $1600 for no fault of ours. Worst airport, worst service and very rude staff. Avoid this airport if you can,",-1
2024-04-18,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,“lack of transparency and honesty”,False,"  Baggage claim, terminal A- 3 carousels but only one in use. Hundreds of people clamoring for luggage. Then our luggage was lost- INSIDE THE AIRPORT. AirTag and the AA app confirmed the luggage had arrived. But the geniuses at American couldn’t locate it. We all waited 2 hours for them to finally find the bags they misplaced. The lack of transparency and honesty made it worse than it had to be. PHL sucks.",-1
2024-04-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,lack any kind of civil behavior,False,"   They have staff who are fairly adept at their job but have accepted that the airport is abysmal, its pretty sad, that no one is responsible or has any idea on what to do. Their general demeanour is passing the buck to someone else. It would be generous to say they had any idea of how baggage control works. They have passengers running from one belt to another, like musical belts early in the morning or late in the evening, often losing passengers baggage because of connecting flights with the very lethargic excuse, well its not here. As someone who has never had missing baggage prior to my experience in Philadelphia, I was disappointed. There are one or two young members who were exceptional in the baggage area, one young man and a young lady working for Air Lingus, really adept at their work inspite of their young age. The rest of the Airport is hopeless, from security to check in to any other member of staff, completely lack any kind of civil behavior.",-1
2024-03-11,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,4,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,"comfortable seating, good dining options",True,"  It was really warm in the airport as a whole. The staff was nice, comfortable seating, good dining options. I love the water bottle refill station. The womans restroom near D9, I used a stall and bumped the hook on the back of the stall door causing a small puncture and bleeding. Thanks for what you do!",1
2024-03-07,0.1,Business,4,1,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,"rude, filthy and mismanaged",False,"  Philadelphia has to be the worst airport in the US. It is such a filthy and in some cases unhygienic (bathrooms at baggage claim) experience. It’s embarrassing to know international travelers arrive and this is the first impression they will have. Only to then have their experience topped by airline, TSA, airport staff who scream at passengers while relaying messages. American Airlines desk agents really are something else in Philly. If you’ve never been aggressively screamed at, at 6am for no reason other than to inform you of bag check procedure while waiting in line, come to PHL. The family in front of me asked if this was a normal occurrence. Another passenger assure them it was indeed. The contrast to European or South American airports is jarring. I fly for work once a week and still am in constant disbelief of how little management seems to care about any of it. Employees unwilling to answer question while taking breaks lounging all over the terminal, on their phones blaring TikToks, trash strewn in random corners, displaced people often with mental health challenges living out of baggage claim (often times yelling at arriving passages as I experienced last night). I could go on. Lower every expectation to zero and you will still be disappointed by your experience at PHL. Consistently rude, filthy and mismanaged.",-1
2024-02-25,0.4,Couple Leisure,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,“better than I expected”,False," The airport was better than I expected - clean, fairly organized, easy to get to. Baggage claim was abysmal - coming back from San Francisco - 30+ minutes waiting for luggage...ridiculous.",-1
2024-02-19,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,baggage claim is delayed,True,  I travel frequently and this is the worst airport. Every time baggage claim is delayed for over 30-40 minutes.  Today I'm arriving from Orlando at American airlines AA 241 and we have been waiting for over half an hour in carousel 13. I have never came to the airport here without problem in baggage claims.,-1
2023-11-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This airport was awful,True,"  This airport was awful. I was disgusted by nearly every aspect of this facility and the staff. It was shocking. Upon arrival we were yelled at and glared at and mistreated by agents and staff. The airport was absolutely filthy and in disrepair.  There were few people willing or able to answer questions or give directions but plenty of employees standing around chatting. The TSA agents were horrible beyond belief. The employees had a power high for no reason as they yelled at any and everyone. It was absolutely chaotic. Every single interaction was horrible, the entire experience at the Philadelphia airport was shameful and I was so embarrassed that this was an experience so many people will have due to people wanting to travel to Philly.",-1
2023-10-27,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,It was shocking,False,"  This airport was awful. Having just returned from travel in the UK with great airport experiences I was embarrassed by nearly every aspect of this facility and the staff. It was shocking. Upon arrival we were yelled at and glared at and mistreated by agents and staff. The airport was absolutely filthy and in disrepair. The bathroom in the international arrivals area reeked and had a thick ring of grime around the entire perimeter and on every surface. There was no toilet roll in two of the stalls and a large puddle of urine on the floor of another. The faucets were broken, soap dispensers empty, and bins overflowing. It was disgusting. There were few people willing or able to answer questions or give directions but plenty of employees standing around chatting. The TSA agents were horrible beyond belief. As I was repacking my things following the scans, one agent took my laptop computer. I said where’s my laptop and he said he thought I’d left it and had given it to an officer. I asked where and he pointed in a general direction and walked away. When I inquired with someone else, he snickered and took it back to a different line than the one I’d gone through and rescanned it so I was stuck behind a large group of other people picking up their things. He thought this was hilarious as did the rest of the crew. Meanwhile, my duty free purchases were routed down yet another line for a deeper check. When I found where my bag was, I watched as the employee pulled everything out of it, wiped it with a test strip, and then handed the strip to someone else to scan. Finally, without saying anything to me, the employee shoved my purchases in my general direction and just walked away, leaving all of my things just strewn about the table. It was absolutely chaotic and haphazard. Someone asked if there might be hidden cameras around because we would clearly, obviously be told that this was a joke and we were being set up for a comedy show. I wish! There were three people who were lovely. A security officer in arrivals, the person who took my bag for the next leg of my trip, and the American Airlines gate attendant for my connecting flight. Every single other interaction was horrible. Aside from those three exceptional individuals, the entire experience at the Philadelphia airport was shameful and I was so embarrassed that this was the first experience of the states so many people will have.",-1
2023-09-30,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,1,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,This airport was filthy,True,"  This airport was filthy, trash, stains and spilled food/drinks all over the place. The bathrooms were repulsive.  The TSA agents were unnecessarily rude - yelling at customers for absolutely no reason and treating people like cattle.  We walked to like 7 different restaurants and they were all garbage - reheated premade food, incredibly loud music and uncomfortable seating. We had nearly 4 hours to kill and would have very much appreciated somewhere nicer to spend the time.",-1
2023-09-22,0.1,Business,1,1,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,how about basic cleaning and maintenance,False,"  I went to submit a review and found the following review from September 13th that captures what I was going to write. “Is an embarrassment to travel in and out of Philadelphia airport! Coming in from American Airlines.. terminal C baggage claim at the elevator, and it smells like straight urine! It’s unacceptable that the toilets are falling apart, that there’s trash everywhere - inside and out of the airport - and it smells like urine”. As of September 20th the area near the C parking elevator still smells like urine. I guess these reviews are not read or believed. The rugs in baggage claim and leading up to the gates are dirty and smell. The parking garage elevators are filthy and always have trash in them. The bathrooms are filthy. The bathroom floors are disgusting. Pushing around dirty water with a mop does not clean the floor. The parking booths are always broken. Parking is way over priced. For many travelers to Philadelphia, the airport is their first impression. A disgrace. How can O’Hare and smaller airports do it so well? It is true the airport needs major capital improvements, but how about basic cleaning and maintenance? It is evident that the airport leadership does not walk through the airport. If they do and the condition is this deplorable, they should resign or be fired.",-1
2023-09-13,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,1,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,"Unacceptably filthy"" ",False,"  Is an embarrassment to travel in and out of Philadelphia airport! Coming in from American Airlines.. terminal C baggage claim at the elevator, and it smells like straight urine! It’s unacceptable that the toilets are falling apart, that there’s trash everywhere - inside and out of the airport - and it smells like urine because the administrators of the airport are not taking care of their business! Unacceptably filthy!",-1
2023-09-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,it is so confusing,True,"  You should offer a workshop for first time flyers at international airport because it is so confusing. For example, when approaching the airport, I had to circle around 3 times until I was able to find the correct exit or lane for parking my car for a long term stay. There was an airport worker man standing at the entrance area and he offered little assistance to me as I was struggling to understand what to do. I asked him a few times what I needed to do and he said, ""push the red button"" but had zero people skills and made me feel unwelcome. I then tried to figure out the elevator, which didn't seem to be working. I then had to carry all my luggage down 4 flights of stairs. I was flying American Airlines, so my goal was to find the security check in to have all my stuff checked out. I somehow ended up in the wrong area. The airport man behind the counter mumbled something to me about where to go but I honestly had no idea what to do with his directions. I ended up in the baggage claim area for arriving flights, instead of where I needed to be. At this point, I was getting stressed and feeling stupid. I went back to the same airport man and asked him again to direct me. He mumbled the same directions to me and I was off again not knowing where to go or which automatic staircase to go up or go down. I then asked someone, another flyer where I could go for American Airlines departing flights for a check in process. Finally, I felt like I was in the right area. And then the lady airport worker then tells me that I have to go up the staircase to another area for security checking of my bags. I took a break from my confusion and just stood by a table. I felt like I was being treated like a beef cow in line to be slaughtered. It was as of all the airport workers could care less about the travelers and they were all just cattle flowing through the hallways. It was a horrible feeling. And to improve the navigation of passengers, I think Philadelphia International Airport should offer an online video for people who will fly for the first time out of their airport. It would help all of us navigate it better. Once I found the proper Gate, I was able to finally sit down and gather my thoughts, my mental state and gather myself all back together again.",-1
2023-09-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,worst airport I’ve ever been in,True," I’m embarrassed to say the worst airport I’ve ever been in has been in the country I reside in. As an airline employee, I travel very often and get a chance to experience different crews, lounges, and airports. PHL is one I would avoid if I could. Starting from the incredibly latent and disorganized TSA agents where working as slowly as possible and being as rude as possible seems to be a key qualifier for the positions, to rude customs agents, to rude American Airlines counter agents (as standby benefits flyers), my partner and I were asked to pay a fee at the gate before boarding - that was a first, and a call to corporate checked the seemingly new attendant that was working with no apology afterwards. To add to this, rude bar staff at Chilies and Pete’s in C gate terminal that would kicked my party from their seating after having purchased food from the restaurant, but not their section of the restaurant, and then again to a man next to us. I choose not to use my priority pass benefits at the “spa” relax massage due to the attitude from the massaging/receptionist working. I question the organizations that hire these individuals, to be so miserable must mean there is a lack of compensation.",-1
2023-07-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,the worst major airport in the U.S,False,"  This is the worst major airport in the U.S. and I've been through most of them. Cramped ugly terminals arranged in such a way that you either walk a mile (no exaggeration) or take a very inconvenient bus shuttle between terminals. Adding to this is the heavy air traffic in the Boston to Washington corridor that guarantees that any weather other than severe clear will cause a delay. Stupidly, American consolidated its previous hub in Pittsburgh into Philadelphia. Pittsburgh has a very nice, spacious airport away from the east coast traffic and weather. Anything for a buck. BTW, American's hub in Charlotte isn't much better than Philadelphia at probably the second worst airport. U.S. citizens should be ashamed to have an airline called ""American"" that operates in such a shoddy manner.",-1
2023-07-10,0.3,Business,3,1,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,pay good money to be treated like this,False, I was coming back from London and had a connecting flight and they left me completely there after the flight was cancelled. No one even told me what to do didn't offer me any incentives or anything. I am from Virginia and I have kids that were waiting on me and I was not accommodated at all. There are homeless people sleeping in the airport and the staff is just not helpful at all. This whole airport needs to redo because this is sick!! We don't pay good money to be treated like this.,-1
2023-07-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,4,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,,electronic menus directly in your face,False,  Terminal B is now approximately 80% high seats with electronic menus directly in your face in your very small seat space. There are no more seats or open seating where one can relax and watch airplane activity. Now it is extremely difficult for families to sit together or for anyone who is not planning to eat the entire time.,1
2023-06-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,serious lack of customer service,False,"  I recently traveled to and from the Philadelphia International Airport. This airport is closest to my family and I have used it often up until now. This recent experience at the airport included a serious lack of customer service, the staff/people were very unfriendly and the airport itself was very unclean. There was trash everywhere not only on the terminal and gate floors but also in the bathrooms along with trash cans overflowing. My future travel will not be at this airport unless it is absolutely necessary. It was disgusting to see the demise in cleanliness and customer service.",-1
2023-05-13,0.1,Business,3,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Tables not clean. Carpet stained,True," This airport is disgusting and the airport and airline personnel are rude and unhelpful. Trash everywhere. Tables not clean. Carpet stained. Seats broken. Whoever run this dump should be fired. Oh, and I paid $40 for three smallish-sized crab cakes and an iced tea.",-1
2023-05-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,3.0,2.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,Most horrible airport,False,"  Most horrible airport. We have TSA pre-check, but they don’t care here. We were told TSA pre-check is in a different terminal. We stood in line in one area forever and then they told us to go to terminal B, which then we had to walk outside a few blocks!!! It was ridiculous. Then we arrived at B for security, waited forever, and we were given a TSA pre-check card, but the security lady had no idea what she was talking about and made us take our iPads out of our bags. Anyone who has pre-check knows that is what makes pre-check nice. You don’t have to take off your shoes OR take your laptops/iPads out of your bag. Horrible experience- we will never fly out of there again!!!!",-1
2023-04-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,most uncaring employees,False," The rudest most uncaring employees ever! Came in from Barcelona, horrific customs/TSA experience. Gate 14 changed from gate 13 and they are miles apart. TSA has no right to yell and speak to us as they do! I'm deaf in one ear! You have a 1200 arrival from Barcelona, walk miles to customs, a stupid kiosk, get baggage, take baggage to airline, go thru customs again with my next flight boarding at 1:15. If only someone cared enough to explain this horrible process I wouldn't be so upset. Got in one security line and was sent to a different line.",-1
2023-01-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the absolute worst airport,True,  Hands down the absolute worst airport I have ever visited. When I say not one person I encountered was kind I am not exaggerating. We flew with American and were affected by the FAA debacle and not one agent wanted to be helpful. I will never fly thru this airport again.,-1
2023-01-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,1,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,worst airport I’ve been to,False,"  I’ve recently moved to Philadelphia and travel quite a bit for work and to visit family. Philadelphia airport is unfortunately the worst airport I’ve been to in North America. It’s not clean, it’s super outdated and desperately needs a renovation. The restrooms are unbelievably dirty. And most stalls without hooks to hang your bag or coat. I’ve parked and gone into the terminal to pick up friends and have felt unsafe waking from parking to the arrivals area. There were people sleeping in the hallways on the long and confusing walk, with confusing signage, from the parking area. Staff are friendly for the most part. But you can tell they are tired and that they are probably not treated or paid well. I dread arriving and departing from this airport. It’s an awful way to begin and end a trip. I’m going to start driving Newark and flying from there.",-1
2023-01-06,0.2,Business,2,1,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,The Airport is filthy,False,  Please do a better job supervising the people who are being paid to clean. The Airport is filthy. The only time I have seen it cleaned up is when Pope Francis visited. Disgraceful! I would rather drive to BWI then fly out of Philly.,-1
2023-01-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,Distance between gates is long,True,"  Distance between gates is long without mass transit or enough moving sidewalks. Year-round, you have to exit the building, in all weather scenarios, and board a shuttle bus to gates. Thus might not be so bad if the shuttle stopped at each terminal, but it does not, so wherever you need to go, there us still walking involved, sometimes back to the gate you need but just drove past. When landing, American Airlines said they were holding connecting flights, but mine was gone when I reached the gate after having to wait for then hop the shuttle bus. Then, when I wanted to go back, from gate F to Gate B to get a hotel room, I was told the shuttle was closed for the night .. it was not yet 9 p.m. When I asked an AA manager for a ride on a cart from F to B, he denied my request. This is unacceptable for any airport to treat passengers in this manner, but really not a good look for the city of brotherly love! For the most part, no one who worked in the airport or for AA seemed to care one iota!",-1
2022-11-24,0.2,Family Leisure,2,1,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,I did not enjoy my visit here,False,"  This airport is obviously not cleaned often, and not taken care of properly. The charging ports are also not in places accessible to people easily. The bathrooms are not clean and noticeably unsanitary. The whole airport is dirty and dull. I did not like the attitude of the security when my family and I were going through check in. This website is glitchy as well. My flight was also delayed. I did not enjoy my visit here!",-1
2022-11-02,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,1,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,"It’s dirty, old and broken",True,"  Sadly as a local resident I have witnessed the continual deterioration of PHL. Is there any money being invested here? If there is it’s invisible. The overall look is tired. Almost every terminal has a different look; many of them very aged and dirty. The lack of TSA check points is sub par for an airport this size. So much of the overall équipent is broken. Today several escalators were out of service. In terminal A East the security line snaked back since only one X-ray Machine worked. At the gate the scanner didn’t work and the gate agents had to manually enter passengers on a computer. I can well imagine the poor impression this airport gives visitors and anyone thinking of establishing or expanding business here. Bottom line it’s no surprise PHL ranks at the bottom of customer surveys. It’s dirty, old and broken. The real question is will anything be done to make it significantly better?",-1
2022-07-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,didn’t care about being nice to people,True,"  I’m honestly embarrassed at the service of the Philadelphia airport employees. Just got off an international flight and was greeted by a rude, shouting man after getting though customs. When I suggested he be nicer to the people who weren’t given instruction and didn’t speak English, he told me he “didn’t care about being nice to people.” Well, then you probably shouldn’t be working with people if you feel that way. If you refuse to do your job right, get a new job. This man should not be the first thing foreigners see when then step foot on US soil.",-1
2022-07-02,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Philadelphia airport is a disgrace to the city,True," Is there a minus number you can give an airport? I fly weekly all over the country and international, Philadelphia airport is a disgrace to the city. It’s like stepping into a 3rd world country. Homeless, filthy, nothing works, dirty floors, poor food and bad lounges. Don’t feel safe.",-1
2022-06-25,0.3,Family Leisure,1,2,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,The worst experience ever,True,"  I would never recommend for anyone to fly out of this airport, unless there is a complete and fluid change in how TSA are trained not only in security but customer service. First let’s start with the disrespectful and unprofessional staff. My family and I missed our flight due to asking for directions of where to go and we were not only sent in the wrong direction but multiple TSA employees told us they could not help us and to keep moving ! Some even ignored us and did not respond to our request for help at all. Very unprofessional and not welcoming at all for this so called city of brotherly love. The worst experience ever. What I can say is there was a manager who stepped in to help the best she could with getting us stand by seats as they became available. Thank you for this.",-1

Went to another restroom. It was very dirty and there was graffiti all over. There was no hand soap. I got off an international flight and I had to leave and go back through security. This was bad because the things I purchased in the other airport like water I wasn't allowed to take with me. The people at the counter where rude. I will never fly through this airport again.",-1

It's a dirty place and there are many rude staff - TSA, Police, Customs, others. There was only one TSA Pre-check in Terminal 3. We had to exit Terminal 1 and take a bus to Terminal 3. The TSA line there was very long. I should have just stayed in Terminal 1. Now I have to take a bus to Terminal 7. Along the way, I met rude staff who yelled at me when asking for directions. There is a lot of yelling and rarely a ""please"". Staff engage with each other instead of passengers. I mentioned this to a stranger while waiting in line and he stated, ""You're in Philadelphia"". This airport does not have much brotherly love.",-1

Just needed to know how to get to my terminal. Stopped one TSA lady and she was very nice just couldn’t read a ticket to see the gate so another guy came over, took the ticket from her then started walking away without even saying anything to me at this point. So as I’m trying to find out where he’s going with my ticket since I have 10 min at this point to find terminal F and the shuttle to it and he starts being very rude to me and raising his voice so I ask for my ticket back and tell him if he’s going to treat me like that then I don’t want his help. His response is to holler at me as I’m walking away still being rude and hollering that he hopes I miss my flight. Rudest, most unprofessional person I have ever had the displeasure of being around. Then I asked at the shuttle if I was in the right place to make sure that I was and the 2 ladies there just point and holler terminal F! Could have just nicely said ""yes this way"". The people working at this airport should really be taught some politeness and customer service. It’s ridiculous how they treat people who are just trying to find their gates. Management should be ashamed of their staff. Traveling is already stressful enough without their added nastiness.",-1

The staff was incredibly rude, and treated me like if I asked a question I was immediately an idiot. The staff was too impatient, too rude, and too arrogant to be of any real help.

TSA said my ticket was invalid then said it was the machine when someone else verified it was valid. Then while everyone else passed through, I was asked 3 times ""are your pockets empty"", I had my hat and belt buckle searched and that was the good part. We see an earlier flight so we get put on standby. If we get on cool, if not cool. The employees were clueless and the process was in complete disarray. ""Those without a seat assigned board on 7"". Hey we're on standby without a seat assignment. ""You need you wait over there"" ok sorry mam. ""Final call! If you're boarding flight x you need to board now"" hey mam were on standby. ""Wait over there until called"". I've been through and lived in Chicago/O'hare, Paterson/Newark airport and a few others and by far Philadelphia employees are mostly rude and clueless.

I’ve been flying out of Philadelphia airport for 3 years now about 3-4 times a year and it increasingly gets worse. Walking out of Terminal C to baggage claim is now home to homeless people. I’m sad they can’t get warmth outside but to be in the airport is not okay. All the bathrooms in and out of the airport are disgusting. It’s like they only clean once a day for thousands of travelers. Not to mention the lack of customer service - it’s time to start teaching hospitality! And be careful with your luggage at baggage claim. They never have the right track marked with your arriving flight. With homeless around, I’m sorry to say your bags could be stolen when you’re waiting around track F for 45 minutes to then be notified on the loud speaker your bags were at track B the entire time.

When I was recently here it was still pretty warm out so I was wearing my vans flip flops when I was traveling and my regular shoes were already in checked luggage. Anyway when I went to take off my flip flops in the security line I accidentally ripped the top part holding the right flip together. That meant the only way I could have walk was to walk barefoot with my right foot and carry the flip flop. Right when I was about to do that walking away from security after I got though they said they didn’t want me to have to walk through barefoot so they called someone to push me to where my flight was in a wheelchair so instead of my foot touching the ground it was on the footrest of the wheelchair.,1

I foolishly left a rolled up piece of native Australian Artwork on a seat outside of Gate 16 - A beautiful souvenir that I bought in Darwin and one that I was really excited to hang in my home as a memory of my trip. I was a bit flustered while getting to the gate - as many are in airports, and as a consequence I left my souvenir on the seat. I realised this on the flight and when I landed in Melbourne, I first asked The Virgin Airlines staff to help me - which they refused, telling me its not their issue and to contact Lost and found. I immediately contacted lost and found, only to be told that it will either be stolen or handed in. Even though I described to them exactly where it would be - after only an hour in transit - the women refused to send someone to check if it was there, claiming that is 'not part of their policy'. Really, how difficult is it to just check if somethings there or not? Its a darn shame that I left it there, but im also really saddened by the lack of support that Adelaide Airport and Virgin airline Staff offered me. Not a pleasant airport experience at Adelaide Airport.",-1

After the fantastic bag drop process I was directed upstairs to the security check. I was 4th in line. How does that happen! The ticket check was efficient. The security check was calm and in control, ample signage ensured that even non-seasoned travellers knew what had to be removed from their bags. The TSA agents were calm and respectful and made the whole process significantly smoother. In fact I think repacking my toiletries and putting my shoes back on took longer than getting to the gate. The American gates at PHL has just overtaken Nashville as my #1 US airport experience.",1

My issue is with the arbitrary processes especially at security lines. My companion and I were given conflicting instructions as to what needed to be removed from bags or persons in order to be scanned. I was told to remove my belt and iPad but keep my shoes on and my partner as told the complete opposite. My major issue however was again with TSA. Despite having a 3-hour layover and my bag being screened internationally twice already, TSA in Philadelphia decided to hold it for scanning so it never made my connecting flight. How long does it take to scan a bag?",-1

We had a layover at the Philadelphia Airport (PHL). Our flight arrived roughly two (2) hours before our connecting flight was set to depart. We had to wait in four (4) different lines, totalling almost three (3) hours. Throughout the stressful lines for customs kiosk, customs agent, agriculture and TSA, all but one TSA agent were yelling and being rude to the people waiting in line. There were no clear directions on where to line up at agriculture, yet an employee was yelling at the people to line up a certain way. She got even ruder and more upset with people when they did not understand her directions. I heard employees complain about not getting paid to load baggage on the conveyer belt and how they better get disability if they get hurt, this was all in front of the people in line. No one monitored people cutting in front of others in the lines. The airport is poorly organized and definitely does not demonstrate 'brotherly love', despite Philadelphia's motto. Luckily, our connecting flight was delayed so we were still able to make the flight. I will not be choosing flights that arrive or depart from this airport again.",-1

I travel a lot so have experience in airports and travel. This airport is the absolute worst I have ever been to. The people are so rude! They scream at you continuously from entering the check points to loading, etc. I’m so sick and tired of being treated in this manner. It’s totally uncalled for.

All airport restaurants/stores and many restrooms closed at 10pm, making 10-2 miserable. Airline Staff were complaining, rude and uninformed. Meal vouchers were issued but the places to use them at the airport the next day were inside the security gates. TSA staff got ugly with a deaf man who couldn’t understand them rather than seeking an interpreter or using a visual communication system, seating at gates is not sufficient for number of travelers on one plane. Bring your own food, a change of clothes, a lot of patience and a plan b because this will be the worst airport experience you have ever had.",-1

Came off plane and waited almost 2 hrs to get through security, only to go through more security, another wait! Then onto connecting flight, more waiting to go through more security, placed baggage in connecting baggage area, guys so ignorant they wouldn’t lift a suitcase onto scales for my daughter.

There is plentiful seating, with most seating offering clean white tables with outlets and USB plugs. The bathrooms were also brand new and no exaggeration, the cleanest and most well-manufactured airport bathrooms I've seen.

This is a hub for them as we were flying internationally to Rome and beyond. As stated they have lost my luggage twice and I have only used them twice, so enough said. We arrived in plenty of time for our connection and had something to eat. Open air restaurant good however, the temperature in the entire airport was well over 80+ degrees. It became so uncomfortable that at one point we ventured out back thru security just to get some fresh air. The airport is OK but, security is rude and sorry but if you can't get our bags on the connecting flight what's the point? Airplane boarding went fine but here is where the glitch comes in. It's March so they have to de-ice. We sat on the tarmac for over 3 hours as apparently someone forgot to put in an order for the actual supply and they ran out of de-icer fluid. The pilot was peeved and again no ventilation on the plane so temps now reaching well into the 90's. Separate review of American, sadly this is what flying comes down to now. I guess the pilot flew really fast  as we made it to Rome, a flight crew guy got us to the gate with an hour to spare but alas the bags never made it. Fool me twice shame on me.",-1

As we stood in line, an official from customs and one from TSA, at separate times in different areas shouted at both my husband and I, ""Get behind the red line""! (Our foot was over the line) and again ""Get behind the gate!"" (which was an open flap). A simple, courteous ""please stay behind the line"" would have worked to get the message across without embarrassing us. TSA also took a sealed yoghurt from me.

First mistake I made was going into the short-term parking lot. I followed the directions on the self-serve kiosk, inserted my credit card. No ticket had emerged from the machine, but the gate lifted, so I went through. Areas within the parking garage are fenced-off in such a way that it cannot be exited without going the wrong direction in one-way areas. At night, there is no alternative to the ""self-serve"" exit kiosks. I was trapped behind a driver whose credit card was eaten by the machine. The entire line slowly backed their cars up, I pulled into another line, and found to my horror that it was demanding a ticket from the entry kiosk. I jumped up and down, waved my arms, and put on an embarrassing show for everyone as I called for help, which came, nice and slow, looked me in the eye, and politely told me to file a complaint. Here it is.",-1

Recent travels to/from Glasgow had us scrambling to make our connections, but return to US on Saturday 9/8 had 1/2 of Kiosks available and terribly understaffed personnel at Customs. 1.5 hours to get from originating flight through customs, back through TSA, and then to our flight at Terminal F, which required a shuttle bus ride and then a dash to our gate.

I would compare it to a third world country but that would insult the third world countries. Cancellations and delays are a constant, staff is rude, the bathrooms are a disgrace (no soap, paper towels containers are empty). I could go on and on. I used to have to travel to Philly for work and it was a nightmare and it's just as bad now or worse. I couldn't even get an internet connection in the airport. My flight was cancelled on Sunday and I was delayed hours on Monday. I couldn't find a place to sit and plug devices in so I sat in a hallway. This facility is so inefficient and poorly run.

American has a nice Admirals club, friendly staff there. Low rating is due to very unfriendly gate staffing. Little concern for customers and not helpful.

2018-06-10,0.7,Business,5,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4.0,pleasantly surprised me,True," A recent international round trip through PHL pleasantly surprised me: the terminals (and restrooms) were clean; air conditioning was generally good; signage was clear; seating space was ample and it was not overcrowded. I especially enjoyed the airside walk between Terminals A and F in order to connect between domestic and international flights: it was a healthy 15-minute walk through a suburban shopping mall with reasonable food choices along the way. But PHL is far from perfect. Many water fountains and electrical outlets do not work: this is a needless frustration. When I arrived at Customs and Border Patrol at around 4PM from an international flight, the area was overwhelmed by too many passengers, almost no help for passengers coping with cryptic passport kiosks, and seriously understaffed CBP posts. PHL shows great promise but needs to attend to simple maintenance and very inadequate CBP operations.",1

Although they have redone some of the terminals and added many food options, they have not redone the staff. The staff at this airport are rude and unfriendly overall. I say this as a ""thick skinned"" New Yorker. Although I am sure there are exceptions, I have never found one. I have not used this airport in 6 years but was forced to connect there last week and could not believe that nothing has changed. I once again told my travel department at work that I refuse to travel through Philly.",-1

Unbelievably they have no electronic passport entry points so everyone is dealt with manually. We had almost 3 hours to change flights on a trip from Manchester to Miami. We made our connection with literally one minute to spare after rushing through the airport! Passport checking took an hour and a half and then full security check the same. Many in the queues are stressed as they know they are going to miss connections. The staff seem to take delight in advising that no one can go to the front of the queue because almost everyone is late for a connection. I will not be using this airport again.,-1

",False,"  Because of rain and lightening, there was a delay in getting off the flight upon landing, however as soon as the lightening lifted and we were allowed to get off the plane, the airport employees were nowhere to be found! They had to be sumened back to their station. Not only that I waited another hour for the luggage to arrive. There was trash all over the place, it looked like a dump! I’ve been in airports all across the US and I have to say this is the most dirtest, unprofessional, slowest airport I’ve ever been in! This airport lack leadership terribly!",-1

After half hour in cold weather, we realised that the bus stop for rental companies due to construction work, had been moved to the other side of the building. No sign anywhere, no advice, no support, no help from anybody. After 45 minutes finally the Dollar shuttle arrived. This was a total disappointment after a flight ATH-LHR-PHL.",-1
2018-04-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,constant delays in take off,True," The Worst Airport in the United States! I have traveled with American Airlines all over this country and the Caribbean. I have been to Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers, San Francisco, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Aruba, St Thomas, and Nassau with American on most of these and Southwest on the others. I never have a problem in any of these Airports. Philadelphia on the other hand is a disaster, where do I begin. Let’s start with constant delays in take off, there are always 10 to 12 planes ahead of you. When pulling back into Philadelphia 10 minutes early only to have to wait 30 minutes till they find an open gate. Then you go to get your luggage and a hour later they tell you they have a maintenance issue. The signage to leave the Airport is probably the most confusing of any airport that I have been to. You leave from gate C so you park in that garage only to return at A Gate, this happens all the time. The B/C Security is far too small to handle the crowds that come to this gate, passengers are lined up down the corridor to the parking garage! If I could get the flights I need out of Allentown I would drive the additional hour just to avoid this place.",-1
2018-04-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,Never did I see anyone cleaning,True,"  I'm a native Philadelphian, and though I currently live outside the city use Philadelphia International Airport ( PHL) a few times per year. I'm embarrassed that this is ""my airport"". Each restroom I used smelled like a barn. Stalls, toilets and floors were filthy. Never did I see anyone cleaning anything. In March, my PHL flight to Miami was cancelled due to weather, I used Baltimore (BWI). Both BWI and MIA were clean, modern and nice. Today I'm at Chicago's O'Hare- very clean and modern! In recent months I was in the Tampa airport, also very clean. Even if something is old it can be clean! The restaurant scene is also very poor at PHL compared with others. Not sure what's going on here but I know I have an option to fly out of another airport, so will be in the future.",-1
2018-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,the most inefficient airport,False,"  This is the worst airport I have ever experienced and the most inefficient airport I have ever witnessed. It is ridiculous that they make you collect your luggage and go through all controls, check in and security again even when you are on in transit. This is the biggest waste of time and ludicrous. They do not keep their flight departure times up to date and so we were running through the airport to get our connecting flight as it said it was on time, however 2.5 hours after the said departure time I am still waiting to leave for London. The gate number changed 5 or 6 times confusing everyone and now we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour and it appears they have lost half of the planes luggage. The pilot has had to get off of the aircraft to try and sort this out because everyone is clueless. Absolutely ridiculous airport will definitely avoid ever returning here. All connecting flights should try and do the same in future.",-1
2018-04-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,Does no one work here?,False,  Arriving plane had to wait 45 min before we could arrive at gate. Baggage took 1:15 minutes to come out To connect to next flight had to go out of security area. Security lines were closed in all terminals so now way back into the gate area until one line night man helped us fond the one open security area. Virtually no staff to ask any questions. At 9:30 pm most food areas closed. Boarded plane and waited 1+ hour. Pilot kept updating us that the baggage handlers had left the door open and no one was answering their calls. Now they have no communication with anyone on the jetway. Does no one work here?,-1

2018-02-13,0.9,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,very pleasantly surprised,False,"  I was very pleasantly surprised by Philadelphia airport. I usually fly into Boston, where international arrivals are a zoo and can take hours. In Philadelphia, passport control was quick and friendly, and the free wifi worked immediately. We were through in less than 10 minutes. Flying out, the terminal was clean, lots of seating and power stations, and fantastic free wifi. We had plenty of food choices (though a few less fast food and more healthy options would be great) and well organized lounges. But the shining crown was the response of lost and found, after my son left his Nintendo in the waiting lounge. We filled out the online form and within 2 hours had a response that the item was found. They organized having it sent to us (we pay postage, of course), and a ""disaster"" was averted seamlessly. Very impressed!",1
2018-01-30,0.5,Solo Leisure,2,4,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,flights never depart on time,False,"  I'm at Philadelphia airport at least once a year and I'd like to think I know it pretty well by now. I can't say Philadelphia airport is the worst airport I've ever been to as it's clean, has a lot of places to get food and shop, there are a few places to charge your phone, and most of the staff I have encountered are friendly. My only problems with this airport are that flights never depart on time because boarding almost always starts when the flight was supposed to originally take off, it's impossible to get a wifi connection and some of the staff can be quite careless. I was recently in a position where I had a connecting flight and was put on standby and left to sit around the gate even after the plane had taken off just to be informed I would not be put on the flight, and if I managed to get on the next one I would be stranded in Arizona overnight for possibly 3 whole days. I had only ever agreed to originally being on standby as the person who booked my ticket had assured me I'd be on the plane, so I can understand what the other reviewers are talking about when they comment on confusion among staff. I had to talk to 3 people before having to cancel my flight and pay for a new ticket, but the situation left me stuck in Philadelphia, as I had come from New Jersey. I wish Philadelphia airport had more options when it comes to getting from there to Jersey and vice versa as Philadelphia airport is the only airport near Jersey besides New York (Atlantic City doesn't count). Other than those flaws it is an airport and it does get the job done - maybe not in the best way possible, but good enough to still go to.",1
2018-01-14,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I always have to wait an hour,False,  This airport does not know how to route baggage properly. I always have to wait an hour and they switch baggage claim bays without telling you. They said it was due to the cold weather tonight. Ok. What’s your excuse the other 364 days? The guy who is in charge of baggage claim should be fired. But we all know that will never happen.,-1
2018-01-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,I nearly missed my connecting flight,True," I see absolutely no purpose for automated passport control at this airport. You have to queue to use the terminals, you then have to queue again to be questioned by a CBP agent. On this trip the queue time for the agent review was in excess of 40 minutes and I nearly missed my connecting flight. It is unacceptable that when two or three wide bodied international planes arrive in short order there are only eight of 30+ CBP desks open. Also, even when you're in transit, you have to pass through security screening again. I cannot recommend this airport if you have a tight schedule for a connecting flight.",-1
2018-01-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,There obviously is no supervision,False,"  Worst airport ever. The employees will not look you in the eye and aren’t at all friendly. I sat in three different places in the airport and heard loud, foul language (very offensive). There obviously is no supervision. As a guest traveler, I felt very uncomfortable. I’ll try to find another spot to sit to avoid these offensive crowds of workers.",-1

The difference in the way the staff at the airport treat you in unbelievable!!! In Jacksonville everybody is helpful and friendly. In Philadelphia they don’t even look you in the eye, they act like you are a complete nuisance and are not friendly when checking in, when going through security - really never! I could not believe how I overheard other people complaining about how mean security was . I really suggest you give them some training in manners, because it’s a sad miserable place!!",-1
2017-11-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,wasn't just me who missed the flight,False,"  This airport is the worst. Inefficiency meets power trips. I had over an hour to make my flight and get to the security check line. It was about a 1/2 mile long because they would not open three of the lines due to giving TSA precheck priority. Once I finally got through the checkpoint, I had 30 minutes to catch my flight. Security decided they would pull me aside to check my bags. This wouldn't have been a problem had I not been behind four other people, one of which had about one hundred bite size snickers in her bag. They checked each stupid snicker four times. This took forever. I asked if I could just leave my food behind so they didn't have to check it, and I would just bring my keys, wallet, and cellphone. They wouldn't budge at all. Once they finally checked my food bag, I ran like a fool as fast as I could to make it to my flight. Once I got to my gate, they had already boarded. Surprisingly, it wasn't just me who missed the flight. There were 6 other people (just for my flight) that had missed the flight. Spare yourself and don't go to Philadelphia airport.",-1
2017-11-25,0.3,Family Leisure,4,2,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,"lack of good customer service""
",True," This was definitely my worst experience at an airport. It's been years since I have last traveled by plane so a little direction from the employees would have helped but barely any was given throughout the whole process, and the only time they did was either with an attitude or by harassing you. The woman who weighed and took my luggage was an absolute joke. I asked her multiple times what I had to do first, since it's been a while, to make both her and my job easier but she insisted on giving me a hard time and actually asked me why I didn't know what to do? Maybe because she couldn't do the only job she had and tell me. It would have taken 2 seconds to understand and get that process over with but she obviously had some personal issues or horrible customer service skills. There is no comparison with this airport and the airports in Florida where I traveled to. Philadelphia already has a bad reputation and a lot of the employees there definitely make it worse, it's embarrassing. I will try my very best to stay away from this airport in the future due to the lack of good customer service.",-1

Is this extreme risk aversion or is the infrastructure that antiquated that the airport can’t handle ‘weather’. Makes it easy for the big airlines customer no service as well to say there is nothing they can do. I should have known better! Too bad I can’t rate air traffic control a big fat Zero!",-1

In addition to almost all areas being nasty, 80% of oulets for traveler convenience do not work. Door security alarms go off so often that no one cares or pays attention. Seven times so far in the span of 2 hours. Horrendous place to be stuck for more than 30 minutes. American airline employee apathy ca be cut with a knife it's so thick.

2017-05-27,0.3,Business,1,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,I have never seen such incompetence,False, This airport is completely ineptly run. I have to fly in and out of here roughly 10 times a year. More often than not there are gate delays when I arrive. One time I arrived and we had to sit at the gate itself while we waited 20 minutes before gate crew to emerge. I am now sitting on the runway moving nowhere waiting to get into a gate behind six other planes in front of us. I have never seen such incompetence. I hate to say it but the staff that manage this airport do a really poor job. And this is my home City. I am ashamed.,-1

After that I spent more than an hour in line for customs because the line I was put into was extremely slow. For each one that passed customs in my line, ten were already done in any other line. Then, I had to walk outside to reach the next terminal. At the TSA control I showed the boarding pass that the connection flight was already boarding; the answer I got was to wait them to check my bag while they were teaching the new hired guy. The TSA guy told me not to ""make everyone aware that I was missing the flight"". I rushed to the gate and there was still few people boarding. American Airlines told me that they gave my seat to someone else. I left two hours and half later to get to my destination where nobody could pick me up because too late.
