This is the worst airport I have ever been to in my life. The lack of post-security amenties makes it even worse. It is bland and there is almost nowhere to sit in the ""gate"". It is convenient to land into, but it is a nightmare to fly out of. You are better off going to JFK or LGA.",-1
2019-03-22,0.1,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Worst TSA experience,False," Worst TSA experience ever! I am a corporate pilot flying for a fractional ownership program, with Known Crew Member (KCM) status. I airline weekly, sometimes multiple times a week to commute to wherever one of my company’s airplanes happens to be. Even before my company had KCM, as I would go through TSA at dozens of airports (big, small medium) I would just show them my flight crew badge, place my bags “between the bowels” not take my electronics out, and walk through the metal detectors instead of having my body bombarded by radiation through the X-ray machine. Also, I’ve never had to throw out water which is huge, when you’re flying somewhere to pick up a plane to fly late into the night. (As I happen you only be doing today). Today while airlining from HPN to ATL to pick up a plane, TSA Made me go through security twice (shoes off and electronics out) shot me through with radiation (twice) and dump out my 3 bottles of water, patted me down twice, and swabbed my hands and tested it! What should have been 10 minute process turned into a 30-40 minute process! This is insane! This never happens at other airports, big or small, KCM or not. This is totally unprofessional, and someone in management needs to retrain their agents. Treatment like this can easily cause a pilot to miss their flight, creating major problems for flight companies.",-1
2019-01-22,0.6,Couple Leisure,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,Most staff were okay,False," Most of the staff were okay. One lady in particular was very pleasant but there was a gentleman at the checkout desk who was unecessarily rude and unprofessional. When I handed him something he practically grabbed it out of my hand. Then, when I thought I was done with him my sister and I are waiting to board the plane. I was tired so I didn’t notice that he was putting suitcases to the side to put under the plane. Even still, it’s not the customers duty in my opinion to be on top of those things. If I was in his position I would’ve kindly alerted the customer that I was collecting the bags. Anyway, my sister noticed so she hands him my suitcase and when she did that that’s when I realized so I handed him mine. Instead of leaving it there he makes a comment about my sister being more attentive than me. True or not, I think it’s out of line to be making those kinds of snide remarks to customers and if you’re going to have a personal conversation with customers I feel that it should at least be something nice. But, that was just the one person so I hope it’s only him.",-1
