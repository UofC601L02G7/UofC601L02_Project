2019-10-12,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,5,4,5,3,2,2,4,"a very modern, efficient airport",True," Pensacola isn't a fancy airport, but it's fine, functional and beautiful. Even the exterior architecture greets travelers in a way that reminds them of the waves and big skies of Florida. This is also a better alternative, in my opinion, to flying out of other Gulf Coast airports such as Mobile, Tallahassee, and Gulfport/Biloxi. Pickup and drop-off are a breeze. Check-in is hassle-free. Security is a breeze, and even more so with TSA Pre-Check. Dining and shopping options aren't ample, but do get the job done nicely, remember, PNS is a small airport! Boarding the flight is easy. Pensacola is just a very modern, efficient airport, one that reminds me a lot of other smaller airports like Louisville (however, no small airports in this country set the world standard like Wellington and Christchurch, both in New Zealand, do).",1
2017-11-27,0.9,Family Leisure,4,4,5,5,4,3,3,5,terminal is clean and easy to navigate,False,"  Pensacola International is a terrific and convenient airport for the entire Emerald Coast/Pensacola Bay area. Flights are rarely delayed, airport staff are friendly, and the terminal is clean and easy to navigate. TSA lines are usually short, and there is absolutely no need to fear for safety, as the Pensacola Police Department, TSA, Escambia County Sheriff's Office, and United States Military Police (due to the extraordinary amount of military bases and armed forces personnel in the area) all patrol the airport and its grounds. Walking distance away from several hotels and recreation areas. Only about a 5 minute car or bus to Cordova Mall, and Sacred Heart Medical Center. As well as a ride to 10-15 minute car or bus ride to downtown, and a 20-30 minute ride to Pensacola Beach (depending on traffic on the Bay Bridge). Being a local to the area, I would also recommend taking the 40-45 minute ride to Navarre/Navarre Beach, which is usually quieter, with a healthy choice of restaurants and hotels, and still a relatively convenient distance to the airport.",1
