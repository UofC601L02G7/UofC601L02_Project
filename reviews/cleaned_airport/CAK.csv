2024-01-26,1.0,Business,5,5,5,5,1,2,5,5,do not expect to be able to get coffee,False,"  If you have an early flight, do not expect to be able to get coffee. There is a coffee shop, but it is never open. You can get coffee at 6 AM at every other airport. Why not here?",1
2022-01-01,0.9,Solo Leisure,5,4,3,4,5,5,4,5,staff seem friendly and helpful,False,"  Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",1
2017-05-06,1.0,Business,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,the perfect size for someone on foot,False,"  
Easy to get around. It was the perfect size for someone on foot. The staff seemed like a small town community. Everyone seemed to be in effective communication with each other. Traveler satisfaction was clearly a priority for the staff at Akron Canton airport. I felt a good, positive energy there. I liked the choices of food and beer that were available throughout the gates. I liked how well my emotional support dog was greeted and welcomed into the airport and on all three flights I took home. I will fly to and from this airport in the future.",1
