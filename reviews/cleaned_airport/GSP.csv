2019-06-20,1.0,Family Leisure,5,5,5,5,0,,,5,I cannot thank her enough,True," It was my first time flying with 2 rambunctious toddlers. One of my granddaughters had her own seat, the youngest would be on my lap. Long story short, l forgot to obtain a boarding pass for the 23 month old and was unable to get through the busy security checkpoint. TSA agent saw my distress, and stepped in with a wheelchair ride for the girls and escorted me back to ticketing. Had it not been for this agent I would have missed my flight. I cannot thank her enough.",1

2018-01-12,0.7,Business,5,5,4,5,5,2.0,3.0,5,"nicely maintained, with super-friendly staff",True," I fly weekly for business, and flew in and out of Greenville-Spartanburg for the last quarter of 2016 and a bit of 2017. It's a small airport, with only one runway, and one long concourse with arbitrary ""A"" and ""B"" separation. The major airlines serve GSP, but flights are limited. I mostly flew on American, which only seems to connect via Charlotte - an 80 mile flight. First - being so close to a major hub like CLT caused almost weekly delays, as my flight was often held on the tarmac by CLT air-traffic control, so we could fit into the traffic pattern. I never actually missed my connections in Charlotte, but did have several walk-jogs across the airport to reach my gate while the final groups were boarding. But, GSP itself is nicely maintained, with super-friendly staff. They offered TSA PreCheck when I flew in and out. I got to know the Avis rental-car staff by name, and they'd give me free upgrades. Best of all, if you use GSP, you have to order a tuna melt from the snack counter on the lower level, outside security. They mix the tuna salad from scratch in front of you, and make the best-tasting tuna melt I've ever eaten.",1
