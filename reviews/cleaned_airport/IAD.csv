2024-07-16,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,,large and well maintained airport,True,"  This is a very large and well maintained airport located in Virginia. Given the size of this airport with its main terminal and then midfield terminals, give yourself plenty of time to get to your gate(s) especially the midfield terminals. On arrival I had to take the mobile lounges to the main terminal. The mobile lounges have frequent service from midfield terminal to main terminal. No more than a 5 min wait. Restrooms in baggage claim are were very clean. Departure was from Terminal C which necessitated using the labyrinth of escalators to get to the AeroTrains which run underground. When I lived in Centreville VA, Dulles was my airport of choice over Reagan National",1
2024-04-23,0.6,Business,2,3,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,Immigration process takes long time,True,"  Dulles Airport is located in Virginia and bit far from Washington DC. Very large and well-maintained airport, very clean. Few sitting places. Immigration process takes long time. Boarding bridge works as bus to the airport terminal. Taxi and bus services are there.",1
2024-04-03,0.9,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,“everything went very smoothly”,True," Having read reviews here I expected a nightmare, but everything went very smoothly. Terminal A seems to be new and very efficiently organised. Staff friendly and helpful and lines short. It was a quiet period, so it might be different at Thanksgiving and other busy times.",1
2024-03-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The worst airport in the world,False,"  The worst airport in the world. Us Customs and Border Protection - who manages this institution?  1 h 45 min waiting on passport control. In Los Angeles it was more than 1 hour. They don't treat tourists seriously but we, the tourists spend our money there. Fortunately on my list only San Francisco is left. Then I will avoid travelling to this country. There are more interesting places in the world.",-1
2024-01-01,0.9,Family Leisure,4,3,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"They have good food"" ",False,"   Going to Washington Dulles Airport is easy when departing and arriving, regardless of connections—good staff, lounges, and great AeroTrains and Mobile Lounges to connect different terminals. They have good food in various terminals and airline lounges.",1
2023-11-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,the worst design for an airport,True,"  This airport is the worst design for an airport. Who cares if it’s architecturally significant? Always horrendous traffic to drop off or pick people up. The over the top threatening ways the traffic police rushes passengers and treats them like criminals is not seen anywhere else in the world and I’ve traveled aboard a lot to see family and seen it all. They need to move some of the airlines to a separate building to spread out the load of cars and people. Try to avoid this airport at all cost, it will ruin your travel experience every time. Not to mention having to walk through a maze for miles in addition to taking ground transportation or tram.",-1
2023-09-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,3,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,Very poor range of restaurants,False,"  Very poor range of restaurants. I did not even look at any shops, they all looked uninteresting. The airport is cold, the toilets without soap. Terrible place.",-1
2023-09-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,like it’s stuck in time from 1960,False,"  I made the mistake of flying international out of Terminal 1 at Dulles. Thursday evening flight, I arrived at 4 pm. There are meant to be four restaurants, but two of them (Wolfgang Puck and an oyster bar) were boarded up closes. Carrabas was open until they told me the bar was closed. Bracket was the only place to get a beer left, and they have exactly zero electrical plugs. On a long international flight, you need power. I ended going to Volo Vino which had a plug (horray!) but not beer or spirits, just wine. I knew Dulles was a terribly managed airport, but this experience takes the cake. There were thousands of people in the terminal and nearly zero places to sit down and eat. Don’t ever ever fly international in or out of Dulles. It’s like it’s stuck in time from 1960. The reason I rated it 1 instead of 0 or -3 is because it was clean. There are plenty of places peddling their wares of course, but that’s about it. If you do get stuck flying out, you might consider bringing along a Sherpa and some oxygen. It’s not the airport staff’s fault either, it’s management.",-1
2023-09-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,"It looks old, dark and dirty",True," After long trip from Copenhagen we about 200 passengers were directed to funny “bus” - packed to the limits and very hot. We did arrival at what looks like United Airlines hub. We are Global Pass/TSA members so we got our face screen and after we had to pickup our luggage to place it back on the conveyor for transfer? There was no screening, no one checking why we had to do this? After we were directed to TSA check - why? We did our Global check which should include TSA? After a long wait we arrived in terminal where we had to walk fast the full length of terminal to catch our connecting flight. There was no place to sit and most of the restaurants had long waiting lines. For anyone specify for one’s arriving for the first time in USA this Capitol airport is total embarrassment! It looks old, dark and dirty. Airport management needs to invite Secretary of Transportation to visit this place as a regular passenger without any preparation for his visit.",-1
2023-06-27,0.1,Business,3,2,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,Worst airport WiFi,True,"  Worst airport WiFi. Has been the same since 2010 - no improvements. No cell coverage so WiFi is the only option - and it’s horrible. Plan on no connectivity and if you get it - it’s a bonus. Bring a hard cover or paperback book or a pillow and you will be happy. Plan on answering email or making a call & you will be sadly disappointed. If I could give a negative 1,000 rating I would. This is the 21st century. WiFi is cheap - use the surcharges to fund an upgrade. Your customers, employees, and vendors will be thrilled !",-1
2023-06-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,little signage or help,False,"  A debacle. International arrival at 8pm on a Monday. Non-US passport control took 2 hours with one desk open. Several people in line with connecting flights pleaded for help to no avail. Once through, there was little signage or help for direction to connecting flights. By 10pm, only one of two security screening areas was open after a long walk and much guessing.",-1
2023-06-19,0.3,Business,1,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,unnecessary traffic jams,True,"  Dulles airport recently created massive, unnecessary traffic jams on Departure by allocating two of the available five lanes in the Departure area to a completely unneeded Valet Parking service. On a regular Saturday evening in early June, we experienced a half-hour traffic jam because of this decision. The problem will be even worse at peak travel times, with added chaos created by people trying to do end-runs by dropping passengers in the arrival zones. All of this creates enormous stress for passengers and the airport security and support staff. Valet parking is used by very few. In the past, it was available in the parking lot just outside the terminal, without creating any disruption to traffic. Why take almost half the available traffic lanes in an area prone to traffic jams? This was an unimaginably bad decision. Please reverse it before the traffic jams get even worse.",-1
2023-03-25,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,poorly maintained international airport,False,"  My family and I visited the USA to visit my cousins. We had to land at Washington Dulles International Airport as this was the nearest major international airport closest to my cousins residence. The arrivals experience was just pathetic! The immigration took forever to complete. Even though the lines are very long, there appeared to be only one or two guys in the immigration kiosks, which together combined made a terrible immigration experience as a passenger. After the immigration was done (finally!) and on entering the baggage claim and arrivals waiting area, I found the area to be poorly maintained and also found water leaking from a spot in the ceiling. The departure experience was a little better. But the security areas made me feel like I'm in a building that is under construction. To sum up, I don't think a major capital city like Washington DC deserves this kind of a pathetic, poorly maintained international airport.",-1
2023-03-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,4,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,2.0,beyond embarrassed for our nations capital,True,"  I am beyond embarrassed for our nations capital. Tourists waited inline for over two hours to get through immigration. Some were elderly and many with small children. Is this how we as Americans want to welcome guest into our nations capital? My experience: Yesterday I arrived at IAD and had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people in the immigration lines (that is not an exaggeration). I was told by an employee to downloaded the MPC app on my phone and I could join the shorter line. I did as instructed and got a QR code. I thought WOW, this is great! Not!! I was in line for just shy of 2 hours. There were only two custom agents for our line and they didn’t even look at my phone or need the QR code. Just wanted to see my passport. I do not have an answer but there has to be a better way in this day and age to do better.",-1
2023-01-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,everything is just so archaic,False,"  The first time I Landed in Dulles back in January 2022 worse the worst travel experience I had ever had, or so I thought till I landed there again in January 2023. What a horrible place to embark or disembark. The terminals, immigration, customs, everything is just so archaic, and as much as the the ground staff try to make your experience pleasant, they are up against a 7 headed beast that just refuses to die. This must be the worst airport in the world. The powers that be who run this airport ought to cringe in shame for putting their fellow humans through such an life changing ordeal.",-1
2022-12-21,0.5,Couple Leisure,2,1,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,ridiculous shuttle vehicles they force us into,False,"  Every time I fly back into the US through Dulles, I'm struck by the inanity of those ridiculous shuttle vehicles they force us into. Perfect reflection of Washington, DC: inefficient and outdated. Plus, they never seem to have enough customs officers at passport control, even within a couple of days of the Christmas holidays. Sad because leaving the US through Dulles has always been pretty efficient.",-1
2022-10-24,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,transit experience at Terminal D was very poor,True,"  After uncomfortable, cramped flights on United Airlines, the transit experience at Terminal D was very poor. Long walks between gates, no moving walkways, low ceilings, dismal decor, minimal gate area seating, and filthy restrooms were all on a par with a dingy Greyhound Bus Terminal.",-1
2022-08-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,stood in a line for over 2 hours,False,"  Appalling. US customs system broke down, we stood in a line for over 2 hours, missed our connecting flight. Have to wait 25 hours for another flight. Most unhelpful staff ever, we are totally abandoned. United airlines are another disgrace. No hotel, food or even water offered to us. We are treated like dogs. Disgusting!! Will never fly into this horrible place ever again.",-1
2022-07-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,entering through immigration is a lesson in patience,True,"  As many have stated, entering through immigration is a lesson in patience. With approx 200 people ahead of me and 5 persons working the kiosks it took 1 hour and 28 minutes to get to the immigration. Once there, it took all of one minute to be processed, thus I do not know why it took so long. Once through, it was time to have my carryon inspected...another delay. In the bag, was a bottle of inexpensive rum that I bought at duty-free at my departing airport. It was in a sealed bag, but no receipt attached to it. I think she may have handed it to me and I simply threw it in the garbage. Well, the staff member at customs told me I could not take it. I spoke my opinion of why from that point forward I would avoid this airport and departed one bottle short. Welcome to ""Merricah""! Now, as an airport goes, Dulles is missing something. It is missing a ""T"" at the end of it's name. This place reminded me of something out of the movie Airplane. A place stuck in time. I had a 6 hour layover and that was the most boring layover I have experienced. Simply nothing to do. Typical of many airports, I grossly overpaid for a sub-par meal, but I was ready for that. The $15usd draft beer made me feel like I was at a Leafs game. The positives? My fight left on time so I did not have to stay any longer in Dullest Airport.",-1
2022-06-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,we all had to stand staring at each other for two hours,False,  Our flight from Paris arrived at 4.30. We went to customs and there were hundreds of people in line. The lines seem to be moving very well and look like everything was running pretty efficiently. Then at approximately 6 o’clock all of the agents left and went on break except for one or maybe two with 1000 people in line. This is not acceptable. We had many families with small children which had to wait in the line for two hours waiting for the one or two agents that were still there to get through all of these people. This is totally unacceptable if the agents had just stayed at their posts for another 30 minutes the room probably would’ve been cleared but instead we all had to stand staring at each other for two hours.,-1
2022-04-26,0.2,Business,2,3,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,arrival was awful!,True,"  Departure was fine, arrival was awful! After witnessing the efficiency of international arrivals at Heathrow, I was appalled at how awful Dulles was. As a foreigner in the UK, I was through immigration in less than 10 minutes, as I was able to utilize their automated kiosk, it did a facial scan to match my my face to my passport, then I went straight to my luggage, as I didn’t need to speak with an agent if I had nothing to declare. The entire time, every encounter with an employee at Heathrow was pleasant. I come back to my own country, and I’m treated like a criminal - get herded like cattle to wait in a long line because they only have four agents working, every agent has that arrogant facial expression and body language, and then I get yelled at by the agent because I declared items that I had bought on the electronic form prior to landing. “You didn’t need to do this.” They use facial recognition as well, but a human has to review it - why? Heathrow is much busier, and they’ve automated the entire process. If the CBP agents think they’re doing us a favor by doing their damned jobs, then automate the process and send them down to the southern border where they’re needed.",-1
2021-05-19,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,My gripe is about CBP agents,True," No gripes about Dulles Airport IAD per se - it is clean, well-lit, w/ good signage, the lounge space is a bit tight, but it works out - the shops and food purveyors are limping due to covid, so that is why they get marked down - this is no reflection on the airport, staff, or concessions. My gripe is about CBP agents. In a word they are arrogant. This is a bad reflection on our entire country for international arrivals. Personally, I used to go thru' IAD at least once a month, often more. Now only occasionally due to covid, and I can report that the CBP agents have had a chip on their shoulder for a long time - once I get pulled aside and sequestered for a random check (they found nothing), and the guy was offensively arrogant and rude. Two days ago I landed after 24+ hours flying and the CBP agent that took my GOES slip was just obnoxious. I am still angry that I was treated that way. His entire demeanor and his body language were overbearing and rude and arrogant. I don't know what it would take for the agents to offer a simple ""good day, welcome to the USA"" or similar pleasant greeting. How about a smile? I know that are in law enforcement, but do not treat us like criminals. If you have to exert your little ""power trip"" over passengers, perhaps a good psychotherapist can help, or why not better training - or just find another line of work. Anyway, I have figured out this reflects the CBP culture at IAD. My final comment is that the arriving traveler should get a pleasant greeting and a smile instead of a gruff, antagonistic ""gimme that slip"".",1
2020-09-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,,5.0,0.0,,,,"No urgency, no accountability, no interest",False,"  Although luggage delivery has been much improved over the years - and not surprisingly was very quick for the lightly used flight I was on (UA107 from Munich had 35ish passengers in the 787), CBP continues to perform poorly! It took me (US citizen) almost 90 minutes to clear immigration. There were at most 5 booths manned and for what felt like 20 minutes zero booths were staffed. Especially when comparing the immigration line to the efficient process of German passport control for citizens of the EU, one feels like a felon returning to a third world country: standing around waiting for the whims of uniformed personnel that stand around behind the booths chatting or staring at their monitor while not processing travellers. No urgency, no accountability, no interest!",-1
2020-02-17,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,An embarrassment to America,True," “A third world hellhole” as a news outlet called Dulles is an accurate description. It is filthy. The employees resent travelers, many don’t speak English. TSA are utterly incompetent with jaded attitudes. I will pay a lot of money and waste a lot of time in the future to avoid them like the plague. An embarrassment to America.",-1
2020-02-15,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This airport is a national embarrassment,False,"  Dulles is a horrible airport! It is amazing to me that in one of the busiest regions in the Nation nothing has been done at this airport to address the remarkable and ridiculous sprawl, the unreal security lines for domestic travel, the terrible, inefficient busing system, the terrible service, and the totally inadequate train system. This airport is a national embarrassment!",-1
2019-12-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,3,4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,Dulles gets the job done,True," Traveling through Dulles now the past couple of years, as it is my primary international airport in Washington, has been pretty consistent. On average it takes me under an hour from check in to the gate, and under an hour on return from immigration to the arrivals curb outside. The TSA officers are efficient on departure, and the return of Mobile Passport is a godsend for immigration on returns. The main problems basically were the management of the mobile passport and Global Entry lines at immigration and of course the dreaded mobile lounges one has to take to immigration. But overall Dulles gets the job done.",1
2019-12-23,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,,3.0,0.0,,,2.0,Simply appalling,False," Simply appalling. Arrived about 9pm ex LHR, 3 officers on the international side initially, reduced to 2 part way through. We were there at least 1.5 hours and we were at the front of the line off our plane. Those behind must have been there at least 2.5 hrs. US public infrastructure is so often very poor. Pick another spot to enter if possible.",-1
2019-11-23,0.4,Solo Leisure,5,4,,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,"Zero compassion, zero kindness",False," I was coming back from my mother's funeral in Europe. The emigration officer was very kind to me and expressed his sympathy. Unfortunately, the baggage control officer behaved quite opposite. He treated me as a smuggler or someone like that. Took me to the side to check my luggage, flipping over all my clothes. Zero compassion, zero kindness. As a religious minister I serve the country for 20 years but yesterday I was treated like an enemy.",-1
2019-11-05,0.2,Business,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,3.0,2.0,little or no organisation,False," Took 2 hours to get through passport control on a Sunday evening, when there were just 5 or 6 immigration officers on duty. Some of them just sat around chatting amongst themselves, then disappeared. Ridiculously under-staffed considering there were well over 1000 passengers in the arrivals hall, which was poorly managed, with little or no organisation. Two elderly ladies in wheelchairs had apparently just been abandoned by airport staff in the queue, with no-staff available to assist them to actually reach the immigration desks. If you’re flying into the US, suggest you plan to land elsewhere.",-1
2019-10-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,Terrible experience at Passport Control,False,"  Terrible experience at Passport Control. Insane that this problem has been going on for months (read other reviews) with no improvement. I got through in an hour because the kid managing the line made a mistake and put me through with the diplomats. Others waited for 2-3 hours. Part of the issue is the constant stream of airline personnel (pilots, attendants) being ushered to the head of the line. We'd see one crew take 20 minutes to finish, then here came another crew. As other reviewers have said, there were empty seats for more customs agents. Those agents that were there couldn't have cared less. I can't blame them. If management isn't working, why should they? I gotta find another airport for international travel.",-1
2019-10-15,0.1,Business,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Staff were indifferent,False,  Horrible experience at passport control. 2 booths were open for most of the time. Waited almost 3 hours to get through. Staff were indifferent. I was embarrassed to be an American by the lack of respect for everyone’s time.,-1
2019-10-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,5,4,3.0,5.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,It was disgusting,False,  The ticketing/boarding agent prior to our boarding was the most unprofessional human I’ve ever seen. He yelled at an elderly women for not knowing what group she was to board. I spoke up and said you are being extremely rude and he yelled at me by saying he wasn’t being rude. We were the ones in the wrong. It was insane! He literally kept arguing with us! I have flown a lot in the last few years and I have never had an experience even remotely similar to that. It was awful! He owes that sweet elderly woman and myself an apology! It was disgusting!,-1
2019-09-30,0.2,Business,1,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,badly operated airport,False, When I saw the bus on the tarmac I thought it was a joke I couldn’t believe that they do not only put us in an old dirty and noisy bus but also makes us wait until got full. I was traveling in business class and the chief flight attendant asked the bus driver if this bus will be only for biz class customers. Right? He answered. Nope. We will fill it out. After waiting and waiting we finally start moving and doing half a dozen stops on an active runway (not safe at all). Once at the terminal immigration officers were fine (I went through Global Entry). And the nightmare continues at the baggage claim where we waited for 45 minutes to get our “priority” bags. I will never fly again to that outdated and badly operated airport.,-1
2019-09-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Only 3 to 6 screening agents,False,"  90-120 minute wait to pass through customs for American passport/green card holders on Labor Day 2019. Only 3 to 6 screening agents were working on one of the busiest travel nights of the year, with at least half the booths designated for American passport/green card holders empty. An airport this poorly designed and inconvenient to downtown can’t afford to be so poorly run. Will pay extra to fly into BWI or DCA next time.",-1
2019-07-26,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,Badly designed airport,False,  Very bad experience. Customs and immigration incredibly inefficient. Not enough space in the Concorde for the waiting travelers. Badly designed airport. Must create a terrible impression for tourists to the capital of the USA.,-1
2019-07-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"Antiquated, dated, unpleasant",False,"  This the worst airport for international travel. It took 2 hours to get through because they only had 6 people working! The nations capital and this is how we operate - how embarrassing and a joke. I travel internationally and this is by far the worst! Antiquated, dated, unpleasant!",-1
2019-07-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,,2.0,Get more staff recruited,False, Wow. What an appalling entry experience to my new working life in the USA. Landed 1520. Entered arrivals hall 1552. It’s now 1712 and I’m so bored of waiting I thought I’d write this review to pass the queuing time! There are 3rd world airports in Africa which are better resourced and organized than Dulles. Get more staff recruited to cope with peak arrivals times. Get family-focused queue systems. Use more technology-based filtering systems. Mr Trump - You don’t need to spend money building a wall - just deploy the Dulles arrivals process to the Mexican border to deter anyone from coming to the USA!,-1
2019-07-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,This is just a bad airport,True," This is just a bad airport. It’s old/outdated, long queuing times and the staff are not friendly. Not clean and you have to get on a (very) crowded bus to get to the terminal Ok selection of shops/restaurants and free WiFi although it’s a bit patchy.",-1
2019-07-08,0.3,Family Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,,Dulles is a huge pain,True," Dulles is a huge pain, it took my family 55 minutes after landing on a domestic flight to walk out of the airport. First we land but need to wait 15 minutes for a gate. From the gate, walk 400 meters, to the people mover, wait for the doors to close, then trudge around the tarmac, exit the people mover, and then another 400 meters to baggage claim. It's been 40 minutes, and at any other airport the bags should be there - but this is Dulles, so wait 15 more minutes. 55 minutes in total. The only benefit of having Dulles as my home airport is I never have to change planes at it.",-1
2019-06-26,0.1,Business,1,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,the least efficient and most irritating,True," As a life gold member with two airlines, and having traveled to more than 100 countries in my career, Washington Dulles stands out as the least efficient and most irritating. From the disembarkation onto a dirty, crowded bus, to the guaranteed 1.5-3 hour wait to clear customs, this is a personification of what the airport will look like in hell. Every time I arrive here, I vow never to come back to Dulles. This to me is the final attempt to stomach dulles. Best they can do, is to try and emulate Heathrow or Frankfurt - and you will get many more tourists to help make America great again.",-1
2019-06-07,0.1,Business,1,5,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,the most unwelcoming airport,True," Always the same story at arrivals, been queuing for 1 hour and 25 minutes and I’m not even halfway through. CBP doesn’t man the booths, even though the early afternoon sees many international flights landing in a short window of time. This is the most unwelcoming airport I’ve ever been to. Ironically, the have a video looping with people saying “welcome!”.",-1
2019-05-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,,used to be so much more efficient,False," After a 12 hour flight from Tokyo, I had to stand in the immigration line for 2 hours. This has happened twice now in the past three months. It used to be so much more efficient when there were kiosks for US citizens. Why did this change?",-1
2019-05-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Chaotic and uncivilized,False," May 14’ 2019 arriving at Dulles from Amsterdam on KLM. After a very pleasant and comfortable flight in KLM’ World Business class the Dulles arrival procedures experience was terrible. Chaotic and uncivilized. They pack you in a cramped outdated people mover from the seventies which transports you from the plane to the terminal to the main immigration/passport control area which is totally crowded with passengers coming from international flights. I was in line for almost 2 hours, authorities walking around shouting to people giving all sorts of instructions. There must have been a couple of thousand of passengers in line. Not a nice welcome to the USA at all. Avoid this airport.",-1
2019-05-22,0.8,Family Leisure,4,4,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,very good for domestic travellers,False,"  Washington Dulles International Airport is one of those airports that doesn't usually feel cramped at all. At this time, I was flying to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Now, I live about 3 hours from this airport, and it's a very long drive, especially with morning traffic. When we arrived at the Departures Hall, I was fascinated with how large it is. Most other airports feel quite cramped in size, while this airport felt like it was big enough to move around. Now, the staff at Dulles are quite nice, however it feels like some of them don't really care either of their job or the passengers checking in/leaving the airport. (BTW, if you fly with Frontier, and you end up departing at Dulles, stay away from them. The staff at the desk are so rude, that we had to wait 35 minutes, and this was just for one passenger.) Once we got passed through security (Took only 10 minutes for the East Security Check), we then headed to the Z Concourse. (This was my first time at the Z Concourse, btw), and it was very small, but there were enough seats at each gate (Z10 was my gate). There was just one restaurant (I think) at this tiny area. Overall, this airport is very good for domestic travelers, but not for International travelers.",1
2019-05-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Horrible experience,False," Horrible experience. I am a disabled person using a wheelchair. Had to wait 1 hr 35 min in line to get to passport control. Luckily the gentleman pushing my wheelchair was very patient and helpful. I had left 3 hours between arrival and my connecting flight, but we just barely made it. At security in Dulles they checked through my carry-on and shoved it back to me all unzipped with stuff falling out. A box of necessary medicine had fallen out and I didn't notice because I was in such a rush to make my next flight. I will never go through Dulles again. Flew through Chicago on the way back - much more pleasant.",-1
2019-05-07,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,Dulles continues to improve,True," Dulles continues to improve. When I arrived at the curbside it took me 30 minutes to reach my gate. That includes checking in for my flight, security check, and going to concourse b on the Aerotrain. On my return I experienced the biometric checks at immigration and I was through in less than 5 minutes. Very pleased the ridiculous customs forms have finally been done away with. My luggage took about 25 minutes to come out. So after I landed it took about an hour for me to leave the airport. Pretty impressive. Now if Dulles can just get rid of the ridiculous mobile lounges.",1
2019-05-01,0.8,Business,4,4,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,an Airport with its eye to the future,True," Very Impressed by Dulles! This is an Airport with its eye to the future. It looks, feels and operates like a Airport with the future in mind. The architecture from the outside, to the new subway stop going in, to the terminal all evoke a modern, clean, sharp architecture with a view towards a future. Some sections of the Airport are still under improvement initiatives. This review is for the general overall presentation of the Airport. An Airport that knows its competing with Reagan National and BWI and it better get it right to secure its future. Well Done Dulles!",1
2019-04-09,0.2,Business,1,3,2.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,A total shame,False,"  A total shame. We had to wait 2h30 at the custom! We were not welcomed to the USA. The line was chaos with children crying, people angry. How can a country treat its visitors so badly.",-1
2019-04-04,0.5,Couple Leisure,3,2,2.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,unnecessarily complicated and tedious,False,"  I've gone through this airport quite often over the years. They've changed their whole customs processing procedures which I found to be unnecessarily complicated and tedious. The customs agents were polite and friendly, but the change from the kiosks that most airports use to this new method seems counterproductive. I think that this change will entice travellers to go via other airports if their itinerary permits it. I also think that there are no actually good restaurants in this airport. We usually have a 3 hour layover and if you want a decent meal it is hard to get - why not have a Macaroni's or a good steak house. Lastly, the airport really looks run down and it is the main airport to our capital city.",-1
2019-03-24,0.2,Business,1,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the worst airport I've ever been to,True," They killed Mobile Passport while promising much quicker passport control. Guess what, came from Belgium - huge line! This is in addition to their awkward mandatory bussing system of all international arrivals to the main terminal. In terms of arrivals this is the worst airport I've ever been to.",-1
2019-01-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,3,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,dual experiences,True," Washington Dulles is a airport with dual experiences, so this will be a two part review. If you are flying with any airline except United, you will have a great time. The terminal used for A and B gates are fantastic and feels like you are travelling through the political centre of the world. It's majestic and there is enough food and shopping to spare. Passport control is fast if you arrive at non rush hour and baggage claim is smooth (this goes for all terminals). If you are flying United from the C and D gates, don't get your hopes up to much. The gate area is old with carpets everywhere and feels like a British house in the 60's. There is some food and shopping, but not at the same level as the A and B gates. Check in at the airport is easy, but it's hard to find the airlines ticketing. If you flying anything but United: Use IAD If you are flying United: Avoid IAD",1
2018-11-18,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,1.0,,unacceptable in the 21st century,True," I support the many critical comments on the passport control at immigration via Dulles. Previously we have come through fairly quickly by using the automated terminals but these have disappeared. Why is this? The effect is that large numbers of passengers are handled by a handful of staff. US residents get better treatment than foreigners, but not much. We came through on a quiet night so only waited an hour or so but even this is unacceptable in the 21st century.",-1
2018-11-14,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,an embarrassment to the Nation,False,"  
Dulles International Airport is an embarrassment to the Nation! I arrived on an A380, the largest airline in the World that carries 500+ passengers and crew members on a 14 hour flight from Dubai to Washington. Upon arrival, we had to board a bus-like car which took us to the arrival terminal. The drivers of these buses are invariably rude and the condition inside the buses are poor. That is definitely not the worst of it! Once we arrived at Customs and Immigration, to our utter dismay there was only one Passport Officer to service all these passengers. After a grueling 14-hour flight this is something you do not want to experience! After what seemed like eternity, we noticed a Supervisor pacing back and forth trying to figure out what to do! A tad too late buddy, did you not know or care to check on the flight schedule for that particular day/morning? What a pathetic situation to say the least! Finally, they opened up the Global Entry where 3 officers were on duty. After 2-hours in line for a 2-minute Passport Control check, we were glad to be out of my misery!",-1
2018-11-10,0.4,Solo Leisure,5,1,2.0,3.0,0.0,,5.0,2.0,Very disappointing experience,False,"  The bathrooms are dirty and the doors are either broken or don’t have hooks to hang your coat or purse. The Air France Lounge was out of service. It would have been helpful upon check-in to have been notified of this and offer a share with a code share Lounge such as Virgin Atlantic. Very disappointing experience. Also, I tried to charge my phone at three different charging stations, and none of them worked. Ended up charging it in the bathroom.",-1
2018-10-27,0.5,Family Leisure,3,3,5.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,not good at all,True," The customer service on this airport is the worse I have experienced, from when my mom and I landed, the lady that pushed my mother on the wheel chair demanded a better tip, after my mom gave her $5 she insisted that it was too little and wouldn't leave. After that we ask help trying to get out of the airport and no one could just tell us a simple you going the right way, thank goodness it is very easy to get around airport. The people at the stores didn't even say hello or thank you. Anyway, the service is not good at all and I am still annoyed from the lady demanding a tip.",-1
2018-10-11,1.0,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,,5.5 hour wait through customs,False," A lot of us poor passengers arriving on international flights at Dulles Washington DC airport late endured a 5.5 hour wait to be cleared through customs, no explanation or apologies for the inconvenience, it was quite traumatic to say the least. I feel not a good way to treat visitors, there was 3 of us from Australia travelling together. Very unhappy.",-1
2018-09-30,0.3,Business,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,staff lost motivation,True," For international arrival it is just one helluva bad airport. For departure and domestic okay. Bad organized with a staff that seems having lost motivation for work. Customers are suffering. IAD seems to tell the same story as public transportation in the US, just neglected tragedy. Hearing tom Waits singing ""see you tonight in the downtown train"". so sad! In contradiction for departure is one very serious airport. I enjoyed it.",-1
2018-09-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,4,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,3.0,Passport Control situation unconscionable,False,"  Flew back from Madrid to Dulles. Passport Control situation unconscionable. 4 agents open to handle over 300 passengers. If ""facial recognition"" is going to be used - instead of machine verification - certainly ought to be more than 4 stations open. I generally avoid Dulles, the cattle cars used to transport passengers from terminal to terminal point to what a poorly designed airport this is and the long wait at Passport Control is a waste of my time.",-1
2018-09-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,embarrassing and shameful,True," Terrible wait time at immigration. Was there to pick up my family visitors and we spent 4.5 hours waiting! There were hundreds travellers waiting to pass immigration and they had only a handful officers on duty. Four and half hours! What kind of the third world country are we? This is embarrassing and shameful. Yes, there were a few flights that came at the same time, but this situation is predictable, and the managers failed terribly to adapt and adjust. Not an excuse. Somebody needs to be fired!",-1
2018-09-12,0.8,Family Leisure,5,3,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,has made major improvements,True," Washington-Dulles continues to improve both the departure and arrival experience. The TSA security checkpoint is large and efficient and a breeze to get through. On arrival upon landing my family were through immigration, had collected our luggage, and through customs in less than an hour. This is largely due to using the Mobile Passport app which any US citizen must have while traveling abroad. But Washington-Dulles has made major improvements over the past years and it has shown. Now if only they could finally retire the mobile lounges.",1
2018-09-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,4,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,it is definitely one of the better ones,False,"  Their TSA Pre-Check and Global Entry lanes are always clear. I rarely have to wait 15 minutes or more to get through security and I have yet to go through passport control where there isn't a kiosk free to use for Global Entry. Terminal A and B are the best (modern and open). C and D are the worst (dark and cramped). The AeroTrain is great and only had an issue with it once while it was undergoing maintenance. If you are an international arrival it will suck (sorry!). You have to take one of the ""mobile lounges"" (a weird bus) to passport control which takes some time and is usually crammed with people. You will also have to take a mobile lounge to get to Terminal D if you don't want to walk from C. Priority Pass lounges are great, my favorite is the Turkish Airways Business Class lounge in B. It is rarely busy during the morning but can get a bit busy during international departures. Their WiFi was fast enough to stream movies. For a U.S. airport, it is definitely one of the better ones.",1
2018-08-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,arrogant and unfriendly,False,"  It took me 2 hours to get through customs. This is by far the worst airport I have ever been too. The staff that are supposed to direct the proper lines had no clue of what they were doing. Furthermore, they were arrogant and unfriendly. I would not recommend this airport to anyone.",-1
2018-08-15,0.1,Business,1,4,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,it took three hours to get through,False,"  
Fly to Europe and have guests flying on from abroad average of 1 time a month through Dulles. Last time was Wednesday 7/26. Lines for customs went all the way up the escalators. For people living in the US with a visa, there were 2 booths open. In the end it took three hours to get through customs. Have contacted IAD about this several times, nothing changes. It is an insane situation.",-1
2018-08-12,0.2,Business,1,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,unreasonable wait time,True,"  As usual, an unreasonable wait time to go though the arrival process, on 2 (two) manned booths for the visitors queue, a no-brainer considering the queue is 200+ people long.",-1
2018-07-17,0.2,Business,1,4,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,a terrible experience to come back to,True," 
I travel regularly for work, and Dulles is a terrible experience to come back to, every single time I arrive. Extremely long queues, majority of booths are unmanned (regardless of the hour of the day), leading to multiple-hour waits, always. The airport and facilites are nice, but it is all ruined by the wait.",-1
2018-06-22,0.8,Business,2,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,a very pleasant experience,True," After a 7.5 hour flight from London arriving at this airport was a very pleasant experience. It looks like they are exclusive to United. Customs was very easy as they had plenty of global entry terminals, coming in from an international flight you have to pick up your luggage and in the same room that you are transiting through give them back for your next flight. I do have to mention that security was a little bit slow and I waited in line for TSA for almost an hour. Everyone was very friendly, courteous, and genuine which made the experience not bad. I really like this airport and I would love to transit through it again.",1
2018-06-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4.0,,this is a shambles,False," Absolutely terrible immigration wait. I have travelled extensively and never waited anywhere near to this amount of time. My wait was 1.5hrs. I am picking up a friend today. She arrived 2.5hrs ago and is still standing in line! Arriving before 3pm and not leaving until after 6pm is disgusting! Dulles airport, this is a shambles!! Get more staff and stop letting the capital city of your country down!! Disgraceful.",-1
2018-05-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,1.0,waiting 1.5hrs in customs ,False,"  This airport and it's TSA are absolutely horrible. And they never have enough people. My most recent experience had me waiting 1.5hrs in customs and leaving 45min In security then the one gentleman told me I wasn't there because the line is 14 mins. Well if that was the case my whole flight wouldn't have been on the plan waiting for me to leave so they could close the boarding gate. I asked 3 different people could they help me because I was going to miss my flight, there was one young lady was not rude but frank and the other two personnel just looked at me and dismissed what I was asking being completely rude with the responses. This airport is garbage.",-1
2018-05-14,0.3,Business,3,4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,worst lines for security,False,"  The worst lines for security, they only had four open. I waited one hour and 45 minutes to get through security. I missed my flight and now I am waiting 4 hours for my next flight. I am all about security and our safety they should have staffed properly for the amount of passengers traveling on Mother's Day.",-1
2018-05-11,0.3,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,worst security line organization,False,  This airport has the worst security line organization of any airport I have flown through. Because of the disorganization some wait over two hours while others wait under 30 minutes. There is no rhyme or reason for what they are doing. Avoid flying out of this airport at all costs!,-1
2018-04-14,0.8,Business,5,5,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,strange safety procedures,True,"  Nice airport in general, with clear indications but strange safety procedures on departure: changing instructions, first to remove shoes, belts, etc, followed a few minutes later that there is now a lighter procedure, with limited checks, all with a lot of shouting. Also; the shuttles going to the different gates do not operate correctly: doors for passengers boarding and doors for passengers leaving the shuttles should not open simultaneously, as this allows you to bypass security. Fast immigration on entering; on leaving, special lane for priority passengers to check ID, but then common line for security.",1
2018-03-24,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Absolutely horrible airport,False,"  Absolutely horrible airport, arrivals into international are abysmal. This is possibly the worst airport I’ve ever been to and will make every effort to never come here again. Anyone working here should be ashamed of themselves and the place they work for.",-1
2018-03-05,0.6,Solo Leisure,4,5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,I was a little bit lost,True," Nice airport even if it is quite big, many concourses, I was a little bit lost. I was flying in economy and so not had the possibility to business class lounges. Why the airport doesn't propose a common use lounge. Many american airport are proposing this service now. Hope IAD will open his mind for proposing this service to economy passengers.",1
2018-03-01,0.7,Business,4,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,have improved this airport tremendously,True," They have improved this airport tremendously over the past few years, however, I still see the lack of a common use lounge as I sometimes have last minute flights and don't always get business class thus am unable to use the lounges in the airport. It would be a big added value to add a common use lounge to this airport.",1
2018-02-28,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,5,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,We want a Common Use Lounge,True," Nice airport, but I don't understand why airport operator/authority don't propose common use lounge in USA. Only business class can have access to airlines lounges. What about other passengers of the airport? Does the airport authority is interested by their opinion? Only business class are important for airports. What a shame. We want a Common Use Lounge at IAD!",-1
2018-02-24,0.5,Business,3,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,there is no common use lounge,True," Really good airport, seems quite new, a lot of space. Only one thing, unfortunately there is no common use lounge at the airport, especially in Concourses C and D. Only United lounges for business class passengers. That's a pity that for a 20 million pax only business class can have access to lounges. If there was a common use lounge, even economy can enjoy time at the lounge by paying a free entrance. Hope IAD will open their mind to international standards.",1
2018-01-18,0.2,Business,1,3,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,5.0,did not provide a very good experience,False,"  Overall, this airport did not provide a very good experience. Upon arrival, I had thought it would be easy to reach an event in D.C., starting five hours after touch down of the plane, but what a disappointment. Most of it was due to breathtakingly slow and appallingly bad organised immigration and passport control procedure, which took more than two and a half hours, even though I was not selected for any specific control so was just standing in the regular queue. Even US-citizens had to queue for more than one hour on that day. Upon departure, I found it very difficult to find my check-in counter, due to a lack of information screens. Security control went smoothly. The shops and restaurants are in no way special and the buildings seem a bit out of age.",-1
2018-01-04,0.8,Family Leisure,5,3,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,a vast improvement for Dulles,True," I must say Washington Dulles has certainly improved since I last traveled through it for an international flight two years ago. As usual on departure the TSA screeners were efficient and got us through security in no time and the Aerotrain to Concourse B was excellent. Concourse B is also very nice with good eating and shopping options. The vast improvement was on the arrival side. I used the Mobile Passport App for the first time (a must for any US citizen traveling internationally) and breezed through customs and immigration in a matter of minutes. Also our luggage came out in a decent amount of time, and finally luggage was not being removed from the carousel by those pesky airline/airport staff anymore (hooray!). We were out of the airport in about 45 minutes. The only minus is that you still have to use the mobile lounge to get to the main terminal. But overall a vast improvement for Dulles.",-1
2017-12-22,0.9,Solo Leisure,4,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,2.0,random-pulling procedure was totally unnecessary,True," I regularly use Dulles airport for my international travel and have generally found it to be quite satisfactory - it's clean (including the rest-rooms) and accessible (if a bit distant), security and passport control are efficient, and there's a good selection of places to eat and drink. But there is one aspect of the airport that I continue to find extremely irritating, and that involves baggage reclaim. From time to time they have a person take individual suitcases off the baggage carousel, ostensibly to prevent too many bags from piling up on the carousel - trouble is, from where one is standing waiting for one's bags one often cannot see this person so one is unaware of this going on. This was the case on my return from London on 12th December of this year - I was waiting on one side of Carousel# 20 and my suitcase continued not to appear, so I started walking round the carousel and found this man randomly pulling bags off the carousel, including, as it turned out, mine - had I not started walking round the carousel I would have been quite unaware of this. There was at that time no danger of the carousel becoming overwhelmed with luggage and this random-pulling procedure was thus totally unnecessary. This has happened on other flights I have taken to Dulles and this must stop - were it not for this misguided procedure, Dulles would be as close to ideal as a US airport can be.",1
2017-11-04,0.5,Couple Leisure,3,4,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,sloppy protecting passenger information,False,"  Customs is sloppy protecting passenger information. Some airlines (Turkish) hand out custom forms to be filled out prior to arrival. Customs at Dulles doesn’t want/need paper but has set up small trash can for everyone to dispose of their paper copy that now contains names, addresses and Date of Birth. This should be protected (PII) and shredded. Brought to attention of supervisor Officer, she was disinterested in the problem and stopped me from retrieving my paper customs form that she placed in open trash can. Need to establish a Secure disposal of these forms!",1
2017-10-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,4,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"waited, waited, and waited",False,"  My husband and I landed at Dulles airport on Oct. 14 from Morocco on Royal Air Maroc business class flight AT0218 at 7.55 pm and encountered a chaotic and rude 45 minute wait to get through US customs. I've been traveling for 20 years from all over the world and have never encountered this kind of confusion and inefficiency. I was always proud of our customs dept and loved to hear ""Welcome Home"" from the polite and efficient agents. Not this time! Unlike in the past, when US Citizens were separated from everyone else (including green card holders), and received priority treatment and less wait time, we were herded through a process with green card holders and visitors who did NOT read the signs about where their line was NOR were asked to leave the lines by the kids (if any of them were 21 years old I'd be amazed) who were supposedly manning the line. These T-shirted tots were rude, unhelpful and clearly had no clue as to what they were doing. When I asked for an explanation as to why visitors were in our line they had no answer, when I asked to speak to a supervisor I had to wait 5 minutes for him and he was as young, dumb and rude as the rest of the T-shirt brigade. After snaking through this line for 20 minutes, I noticed some of the T-Shirters letting people through to the front of the line. When I asked about that I was told they had ""used the app"" so they got to go to the head of the line while everyone else who were uninformed about this app (there were no signs advertising the app) waited, waited, and waited. When I got to the agent at the desk, he was older but just as ill-informed and defensive about the mess as the T-shirt tots. Finally, got through the line/passport inspection and met up with a uniformed official (and a polite adult) who attempted to explain the situation. He acknowledged that the people with the app should not have been shown to the front as it was unfair since there was no signs saying that with the app you could jump the line, and then he explained that for just $100 a year (each) we could avoid all the mess altogether. Wow! We're now supposed to pay a couple hundred dollars (even after paying US taxes) for the privilege of not waiting in lines with these desk agents. A beacon of Democracy or an example of American exceptionalism your name is not Dulles airport!",-1
2017-06-13,0.7,Couple Leisure,4,4,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,things have much improved,False," Washington Dulles has a long history of problems owing mainly to ongoing construction and an ill-conceived layout that is hostage to the airport's status as an architectural icon. Things have much improved. Flying domestic first class on United gives us privileges not available to all, but even economy check-in was efficient and free of lines at the time we checked-in (admittedly, not at rush hour). TSA Pre-check is efficient, especially for members of Clear; all Washington-area airports have Clear available. Trains to the concourses are frequent and efficient. One serious drawback is the long slog from the Concourse C AeroTrain station and the actual terminal because the train station is where the anticipated permanent concourse will be - some day. There is no train service to Concourse D, leaving passengers to go by the original mobile lounge system the operates reasonably well. Concourse C/D is a ""temporary"" concourse constructed in the 1980s and not really suitable for the large passenger volume it must handle. Nevertheless, passenger amenities have improved considerably of late, with the addition of several higher-quality full-service restaurants. Passenger amenities in Concourse A/B are much better. Boarding at C/D is cramped, although well-organized by United. As far as field operations are concerned, Dulles is among the country's better airports, with a runway structure and field size that seldom leads to delays. Walking distances on the concourses can be quite long.",1
2017-05-01,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,5,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,close to 10 pm almost everything was closed,False," Well I arrived to Washington Dulles airport at 8:45pm April 30th and I was hungry and I need it a place to charge my phone. I was walking in Gate A and B. Gate B had a lot of stores and restaurants but I noticed that most restaurants and stores are about to close. I rushed to get some food at Wendy's and charged my phone. after 30 minutes they kicked me out. Anyway close to 10 pm almost everything was closed. My next flight at 6:30 am. So I finish my sandwich and charged my phone and found place that will be comfortable. This airport at night is basically nothing. Pros - not a lot pf people, free and good WiFi, clean, staff are friendly and a lot of places to charge your phone. Cons - not a lot of food choices (compared JFK, LA, Miami, Atlanta airports) and is very dead at night. Nothing to do. No shopping, no bars.",-1

2016-08-17,0.6,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"not great, but not bad either",False,"  As some other commenters have noted, Dulles was designed for a different model of operations than most subsequent airports, and the efforts to integrate the design of the airport with current practices can be very awkward. Dulles is a distinctive airport in many ways, so much so that it presents significantly different experiences, based on the particular type of flight you're on, as I'll elaborate on below. For the aspects of travel that are universal regardless of type of flight (check-in, security, parking, etc.), it's decent overall. The new(-ish) train is a big improvement on the old ""mobile lounges"" (which are still used to concourse D, though), I've had mostly pleasant and efficient experiences with check-in, and have even been pleasantly surprised by the speed at security on some occasions. For getting to the airport via car, you definitely need to be aware of traffic and plan travel times accordingly - I've had many painless experiences, but if it's around rush hour, beltway traffic can be ghastly (though the Dulles Access Road itself is usually fine). For domestic flights, Dulles has the best selection of non-stop long-haul flights of the 3 DC-area airports, and it's generally an acceptable experience, concourse A/B is a lot nicer than C/D, though. For myself, if it's a choice between a non-stop from Dulles or a flight with a connection from another airport, I'll take the non-stop from Dulles; if the choice of flight is otherwise equivalent, though, both BWI and DCA are more pleasant options. For departing international flights, the experience is essentially like that for domestic flights - not great, but not bad either. For arriving international flights with Dulles as the final destination, it's below average. The mobile lounges to get to immigration & customs are always inconvenient and almost invariably crowded. I've had both good and bad experiences with the speed of immigration and customs, but the wait for luggage is usually short (if immigration is slow, there might be no wait at all). Since Dulles has the vast majority of international flights of the DC-area airports, if DC is one's point of origin/destination, there usually isn't a choice about which airport to arrive at. For arriving international flights when DC is NOT the final destination, avoid Dulles at (almost) any cost. The slowness and inconvenience of the mobile lounges, unpredictable time for immigration/customs, and the possible need to then take another train/bus to get to the concourse for your connecting flight must be incredibly stressful. To summarize: Dulles is acceptable for domestic flights and international departures, below-average for international arrivals with Dulles as final destination, and to be avoided if at all possible for international arrivals with subsequent connections.",1
