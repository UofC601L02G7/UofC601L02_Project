2024-08-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,“Shame on the management”,True," Our Amsterdam flight arrived at time precisely. 1.5 hours wait on the tarmac because of the gate agent, because of other reasons. In the international arrival hall > 500 people, 3 officers to check passports, > 2 hours waiting. In civilized countries, usually helpers are asking passengers about tight connections and help them through to catch their flights. The assistants here were few and could not care less about us. The luggage’s checked in and out for customs - the re- check points with other assistants (watching their phones) directing passengers how to put their luggage on the right position - not helping or moving a finger in the process. Security - same rude treatment: we supposed to push our bags through the tunnel - at the flashing red light - who would know? workers standing there and screaming at us, not helping at all. I had to run like crazy to catch my flight and I would have never be able to do it without the help of a kind fellow passenger. Shame on the management to allow this to happen. “Welcome to the USA “ was written on monitors. It was a mess and a far cry from anything welcoming. I will try never to go through that airport again.",-1
2024-06-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,TSA line was long,False,   TSA line was long. The wait said it was 25 minute but it was 45 minutes. TSA security check didn’t say a word to get the process moving. They don’t tell anyone to take off their shoes or about electronics to be prepared. Everyone was upset because they didn’t communicate which made the process longer. One person was yelling at someone in a wheelchair.,-1
2024-06-12,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,1.0,"airport is obviously poorly managed"" ",True,"   You be prepared to walk a lot. Then at the Arrivals/Baggage Claim the cars are double, triple parked and will sit there for 20, 30, 40 minutes blocking traffic and making it impossible to load your car. We saw some cars just sitting there for over an hour while our man went to get our rental car. Security is non-existant, we never saw a guard until some dude threatened us while we were trying to back our car in to load, then one slow-witted airport security dude shows up, and basically does nothing because ""that's always how it is here...and I'm supposed to be on my break."" Eventually four real police arrived to deal with a situation that never should have happened in the first place. Try double parking at LAX Arrivals for longer than three minutes and see what happens. Stop letting people quadruple park at Arrivals before someone gets violent, because it will happen eventually if it hasn't yet. This airport is obviously poorly managed, and security is lazy.",-1
2024-02-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst experience I’ve had,True,"  I normally don’t review, however my experience at the Minneapolis airport was the worst experience I’ve had at any airport I’ve traveled to. I agree with other reviewers, if you can fly somewhere else, do that. The rudeness I encountered from the staff made me feel belittled, unwelcome, and left me shocked. We pay a lot of money to fly through your airport. And then, if you do try and say anything to any workers, about how awful they're treating you, your in the wrong because they work there. That’s not right.",-1
2023-04-23,0.4,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Go somewhere else if you can,False," So getting checked in and boarding is easy. It's the customs that can't get things figured out. You know how many planes are arriving, and how many people are on each flight, then you should have enough staff to move people in a timely fashion. Yet the simplest jobs your in a 3hr waiting line. Go somewhere else if you can.",-1
2023-03-29,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,"Airport restrooms unkept"" ",False," We are on a layover from Cancun to Portland, the deboarding, customs area had one, filthy gross restroom. The Delta wing of the airport has very few restaurants choices or shops to browse/entertainment while stuck here. We ate at Mill Tavern, although the customer service was great, the food was not, very few choices and very over priced. They offered to remake my burger as the first one was too raw, the second was cooked done, it was just wasn't good, fries soggy and flavorless. Airport restrooms unkept, poor food choices and/or restaurants with comfortable seating to waiting. Hope I don't have to visit this place again!",-1
2022-09-06,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,1.0,"disrespectful, ill-tempered employee",False,"  Security is a big deal, and everyone just wants to get though the most efficient way possible, but I have never seen such a disrespectful, ill-tempered employee ordering passengers about as I did today at Security checkpoint 1. I witnessed an extremely elderly couple arrive at the TSA que. They were traveling alone and obviously had trouble getting around. They did not have the correct boarding documents, but instead of showing compassion, or helpfulness, the airport employee yelled at them and told them to get out of line & go back to the ticketing counter. The elderly woman asked if her husband could wait there ( he had a very hard time walking) but the grouchy employee said,” No, you have to take him with you! I don’t have anywhere to stash him!” Like he was a piece of luggage or something. Next she ordered me & my family to a TSA booth that didn’t have an agent manning it. We stood there briefly, looking to see if an agent was coming. Next we stepped to the next agent to show our ID & boarding passes. She charged over to us and told us to stay where she put us! I pointed out that there was NO agent where she sent us, and she proceeded to start stomping around barking out orders. My husband just told her we were staying in the line we stepped to because the TSA agent was already processing my daughter.",-1
2022-08-25,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,ill-designed and unfriendly airport,False,"  
Having traveled extensively in my 59 years, I have to say that MSP is one of the most ill-designed and unfriendly airports in the world. Yesterday I walked 2+ miles to my connection, the moving walkways not operating. Every single time I’ve flown to/from/thru MSP in the past 30 years there has been an issue. Entering the States from Europe several times we were detained in security for 3 or more hours, our kids taken to the other side of the room while we were interrogated. Never has this happened at any other airport in the world on our travels. Last time we waited for 20 minutes for a French translator to come to read the label on a can of foie gras to determine if it contained pork.  You need to do better MSP! And get better transport from C20 to F15 (in example) - no one should have to walk miles (literally) to get to their connection flights!",-1
2022-07-11,0.6,Business,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,total of 15 electric parking spots,False,  MSP Airport does a great job with stores and restaurant options and recently completed some moderate improvements in aesthetics to terminal 1. They currently offer a total of 15 electric parking spots which are spread out across 3 sites! It appears the planning team completely overlooked this aspect of the customer experience.,1
2022-06-17,0.6,Business,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Not a bad airport but not a great one,False,"  Not a bad airport but not a great one. Getting from the outer C Concourse to the main terminal is not intuitive (there is a train I would have missed if not for the help of a local). Directions to Light Rail are not entirely intuitive and the airport maps online are absolutely useless for figuring out how to get from the Light Rail to the gates. The food selection is ok but not what I would expect at a hub airport. Ditto the shopping. Security was quick with little wait in the TSA or regular lines. I used Delta, which is the dominant carrier here. The service was okay. The thing with Delta is that they are pretty inept at their home base in Atlanta, but often better elsewhere, The most remarkable thing here was that one person managed the gate ---this may be a legacy of Northwest (which Delta acquired). Delta's legacy facilities usually have two people at the gate with one often more inept than the other (DCA and ATL). This is an ok airport of you can figure out the logistics.",1
2022-06-17,0.1,Family Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,This was very stressful for my family and especially my mom,True, My mom is a 67 year older paraplegic. As we were going through security she was pushed off to the side and left there for 20 minutes. My sisters and I started to complain after about 15 minutes and were told to be patient. Then after 25 minutes of mom sitting there as everyone passed her by we really started complaining about missing our flight. Finally we were told to find a manager where about 5 people were standing at a podium. There was a lady there with red hair visiting that came to help us. It then took another 15 more minutes to get mom passed through security. We missed our pre-board time and were told at the gate that she should have pre-boarded. Well no kidding. This was very stressful for my family and especially my mom. This should never be the case that she is singled out and made to feel like an annoyance in an airport on vacation.,1
2022-03-16,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,I travel frequently and have never been so disrespected,False,"  I’m the first to admit that TSA is not a desirable position but I’m also a strong believer in being kind and I’m not sure these TSA agents are capable of being kind. There’s no instructions for what to do when you get up to security, yet they got extremely angry when people weren’t able to read their minds regarding their expectations. I travel frequently and have never been so disrespected as I was by these TSA agents. Otherwise, terminal 2 is clean and the bathrooms are nice.",1
2021-12-16,0.5,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,"decent, clean, modern airport",False," This airport has two Terminals. Be very aware which terminal you need to be in: 1 or 2. Find out what terminal you are landing in and renting your car and what terminal you will be leaving from - ask for the address of where to drop your car off. Otherwise, your GPS may lead you unknowingly to the wrong terminal. Trying to figure out the public subway system to move between terminals was not easy or fast. The signs are somewhat confusing and, as a result of COVID, some of the Information Desks are closed. I found an open Information Desk, but the staff member was so mean I chose to figure out things on my own rather than be belittled by him for getting lost. I found a very friendly staff member in the hallway and he was able to clearly explain how to get to my destination. Otherwise this is a decent, clean, modern airport with an ok selection of shops and restaurants. It is what I expect for a city or cities this size.",-1
2021-10-18,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,Not a single restaurant or store open,True," Arrived at the airport at 8.30pm on a Sunday. Not a single restaurant or store open. No food, no drink, no amenities. Vending machines filled with just candy. Bad form.",-1
2021-09-17,0.6,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,Nice airport to transit through,True," Nice airport to transit through. There was a woman playing piano in between the E and C concourses. There were many volunteers around to give directions and advice. There were also lots of places to sit, eat, and charge your device as well. The seats would get high marks from the people at 'Sleeping In Airports'. My only complaint is getting around the concourses is by foot only. There is tram but it is outside security.",1
2021-08-29,0.3,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Needless to say no one impressed!,False,  Airline (Sun Country) did a excellent job of getting us in before bad weather hit. Unfortunately the ramp manager decided that the workers shouldn't have to unload the plane in the rain. We arrived at 12.00am (midnight) and very light rain starting. Had to wait for over a hour for our baggage. Remember this is now after 1.00 am. and there were multiple small children on the flight. Needless to say no one impressed!,1
2021-08-10,0.1,Business,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,All but 1 food service option was closed at 6pm,False,  All but 1 food service option was closed at 6pm and that location had closed about half their tables - leaving a lot of people unable to find food. Major city airports don’t close at 6pm on a Monday. All but one store closed and they were mostly bare shelves. Staff at airport very unhelpful on offering options. Will schedule around this airport for all future travel - clearly don’t want to service the travelers.,-1

2020-09-29,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Absolutely the worst,True," Absolutely the worst. Got lost in construction, then lost in the building, as there were no people working on that floor. Got to check-in late and American Airlines check in staff were so incredibly slow, the entire line was freaking out! Had to take a later flight, this was not ok. Worst airport.",-1
2020-06-06,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,It's how airports should be!,False,"  Great airport. It's clean and fast to transit through. The CBP staff were great as were the TSA staff. There are loads of shops, food outlets and seating. It's how airports should be!",1
2020-03-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,rude and dismissive,True," The airport itself was fine. Clean and easy to get where I needed to go. My problem was with the security agents. Every one of the four TSA agents I encountered were rude and dismissive. I also heard an older women state - “there is no need to be that rude!” So I was not the exception. I had no issues or anything with my screening. There was absolutely no reason for their attitude. And, it makes no sense to ask if I recommend this airport - it’s all about location, not quality.",-1
2020-03-07,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,nearly all vegan options were gone,False,"  I have been flying out of the Minneapolis airport for years. I tell people often it is a great airport to be vegan. Well, that was until today. I traveled up and down the whole G concourse only to find that nearly all vegan options that I have come to appreciate were gone. In addition, I could not even buy a bag of nuts, unless they were covered in chocolate/candy.",-1
2020-03-06,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,2.0,3.0,Not a traveler friendly airport,True," This is a very large airport and it is very congested. When I first arrived and disembarked the aircraft, people were all standing around for the next flight. I had to squeeze my way through. It was a very long walk from the gate to baggage claim and getting to the Uber pickup from baggage claim was just as confusing. Not a traveler friendly airport.",-1
2020-02-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,would avoid making a connection at this airport,True," This airport sprawls. It could be a long distance to traverse between your arrival and departure gates. There is a tram connecting parts of the half dozen concourses but you need to be at the correct place to board it. In any case, be prepared to give quite a bit of time to make to your connecting gate. The food outlets are not evenly spaced out which also means quite a bit of going to and fro in search of a bite. However, directional signs are very clear. I would avoid making a connection at this airport which is a Delta hub.",-1
2020-02-05,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,"employees were rude, condescending, dismissive",False,"  Absolutely terrible customer service. My daughter left her purse on a handicap golf cart, and the driver (who we later ran into) turned it in immediately to lost and found. When we came back 4 days later (after writing a report and calling - and being dismissed at every turn) we were told it wasn't there. Now we are being asked to pay to send it to us, when it was there from Friday on (we checked Monday and were rudely treated/turned away). Our entire experience, aside from three people total - in both coming and going - employees were rude, condescending, dismissive. I have never had such a terrible experience with any travel/airport entity. Will truly avoid at all costs from here on out.",-1
2020-01-04,0.4,Business,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,it is totally inadequate,False,"  If concourse G is strictly for international departure, it is totally inadequate. Departing for Incheon and not enough space to seat waiting passengers or queue lines.",1
2019-12-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,lack of consideration for travellers,False,  G gate area nice seating but music from the bars is so loud its deafening. After a long day of travel I need something quieter. Poor design and lack of consideration for travellers.,1
2019-12-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,lines at this airport are the worst I’ve experienced,False,  This is my second time here in 3 months and I have to say the security lines at this airport are the worst I’ve experienced in years. How can you only have two lines and then only one person checking people on a Sunday?,-1
2019-11-09,0.2,Business,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,one of the worst airports,False,"  This is one of the worst airports I have ever been to. There is not enough seating at the gates, a limited number of outlets to charge devices. Security Line is an absolute nightmare, it is like they let a 2-year-old organize it. Baggage Claim is a joke. Never trust that your luggage is on the belt they say it is.",-1
2019-11-09,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,No management of lines,True," Shambles. Big queues at bag drops, even bigger at security landside to airside. No management of lines so those whose flights are due to leave can move to the front. If I had a choice I’d avoid. Take a look at some of the big European hubs if you want to understand how to work check in and security.",-1
2019-08-03,0.4,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,Extremely chaotic TSA screening,True,"  Extremely chaotic TSA screening. An agent rushing through the queue ran over my ankle with a wheel chair. After passing through scanner. My Carry on was flagged, along with several others - suddenly there was a back log of 4 passengers waiting for an agent to go through our carry on bags and no agents  around. Passengers were scrambling, looking for lost items. It felt like a surreal B movie. Next time I fly, I will choose a different time of day. Ps, my blueberry jam in a sealed jar was confiscated and thrown away. Wasteful, shameful, and worse, the TSA canine unit was making us walk like a military rank. I am speechless at the hypocrisy of this country..",-1
2019-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,disappointing traveling experience,True,"  I was returning from vacation with my husband and 2 kids from Cancún. When we arrived at 7:21pm at the airport and registered at the kiosk Delta agent told us to go to the left line where the line was very long and foreigners with non-us passport were standing. We were last in the line and the line was not moving. I saw everyone else from our plane were on the other line and were already checked out and got their luggage and we were still standing at the end of the line with about 40 people in front of us. When I asked one of the Delta agents and told her there must be some kind of a mistake cause we’ve been waiting for more than an hour and everyone else from our flight is on the other line she told me it’s because my husband has a foreign passport and because it has an x written on it so we have to stay in that line. I told her we’re family of 4 and my 2 kids and i have us passports but she said we have to stay in that line and wait. I was so upset because of the long wait, I was sick, and the fact we had to drive back home to Fargo which is 4 hours away from Minneapolis but no one seemed to care even when I physically walked over to the security guard and told him about our situation he told me rudely to go back to my family and wait. When everyone finally left and we came to check out the agent was so rude to me and told me to complain to his boss who was by the way a nice gentleman and when i explained to him that we live in States and my two kids and I have passports and my husband has his Bosnian passport and a green card he then asked if we have shown the Delta agent his green card. I said we didn’t because we were never asked for it. He then said that Delta agent should’ve sent us to the faster line because my husband had sufficient docs. He aldo said that I can complain to Delta supervisor at the front with the red suit on. I saw the lady and when asked if she’s a delta supervisor and she said yes I explained what had happened and why I’m upset. She very calmly said sorry but that her agents are fully trained. It wad pretty clear to me then that she wasn’t interested in my story or that she cared, let alone admit the fault. This was by far the most humiliating and disappointing traveling experience ever!!!",-1
2019-06-25,0.4,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,So unorganized,False,  Poor signage everywhere. The highways under construction made finding rental car return impossible. 2 Hertz car locations?

2019-06-23,0.4,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,no carts for luggage anywhere,False,"  Had to walk a mile to gate and no carts for luggage anywhere, until I reached my gate. Oh and then you stick people and drain them for money. I travel the world and all airports have carts and I've never paid. I think this is tacky and low class.

2019-06-05,0.5,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,so grateful for the help,True,"  I don't often write reviews but I would be ungrateful if I didn't thank one of the wonderful employees who helped us yesterday, Tuesday, May 21, 2019. We flew out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport yesterday morning. We had a 6:50 am flight and arrived to return our rental car at 5:20. When we entered Terminal 1 we were shocked to see the security lines running both directions down the center of the terminal. One line had even doubled back on itself. I have never seen such long lines at any airport! (I hope it was due to bad weather the past few days and the need to reschedule people who missed flights but the security line would have taken at least 1 1/2 hours to get through) My husband and I have pre-check but my elderly parents ( early to late 80's) did not so he went through to our gate to make sure he could catch the flight for work while I stayed in the security line to help them. The line was moving very slowly and I became concerned that we might be in the wrong line. I asked a security officer near me if indeed I was headed in the right direction and expressed my concern that we would miss our flight. He said I was in the correct line and asked if I possibly had pre-check. I explained that I did but my parents didn't and that I needed to stay to help them through security and on the flight. He kindly had us follow him to another line where we were able to get through security as our flight was continuing the boarding process. We were able to grab a courtesy cart, as our gate was a long walk from the security checkpoint. We arrived at our gate just as boarding was finishing. I am so grateful for the help.",-1

I was appalled to experience such a disgustingly dirty ladies restroom in Minneapolis! The stalls had either no toilet tissue or barely any, with only the last remains of a role in a few. There were no hand towels in the dispensers and just one paper towel role setting on the wet sink counter. Plus, there was a good amount of water on the floor. Such a contrast to the beautiful, pristine bathrooms of the Phoenix airport! Management needs to seriously look at this problem. Left me with a poor impression of this airport.",-1

Therefore, there was little to nothing I could eat. I was left spending $10 for a dried bagel that was clearly made a week ago.",-1

2018-11-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,love this terminal,True," Minneapolis St Paul Terminal 2. I love this terminal, it is simple, easy and although it does not have the space of Terminal 1 or all of the amenities, it is a breeze. At MSP, Terminal 2 was added as an expansion and it has since been expanded to 14 gates and it is essentially a large hallway with very simple parking and a few restaurants. The terminal is small but that is also it's best appeal, it is so easy to navigate and spend time in. I have been through domestic and international departures and arrivals and it has just been easy, the way it should be. Parking is simple, one of two ramps, Orange or Purple, park your vehicle, walk across the skyway and you are in. If you are on the side with security open, you just walk into security if you do not need to check a bag and you already have your ticket. Once you are through security, find your gate (not that hard, there are only 14 of them) and go get something to eat. The food is good and mostly local to Minneapolis but be aware that the airport's amenities do not open until 5am, the restaurants open later than that. I ran into this problem with an early Sun Country flight to Cancun. Arrival is pretty much just as easy, you'll be in the airport just long enough to get your bags and a cup of coffee and then walk across the skyway and get in your car. Sun Country and Southwest are the primary carriers out of Terminal 2 and there are a few others as well. I do wish Delta would have a few flights out of this terminal, it would make things much easier for some passengers.",1
2018-10-31,0.8,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,the experience was good,False," Minneapolis St Paul is one of the best airports I have used over the past decade. Baggage check-in is pretty efficient, security lines move quickly, (and there is plenty of room both before and after the scanners), and there are a lot of varied options for eating and shopping in the terminals. My only real complaint on this trip was a lack of clear signage to get to the rental car area from the main terminal. There were signs for ""ground transportation"", but nothing that said ""rental cars"" until you were practically there. It took a couple of wrong turns before I got to the tram and got the car. Getting back to the arrivals pick-up area where my wife and bag were waiting took a good 15 minutes due to lane closures from construction. Other than that, the experience was good, as usual. A far cry from our home airport in Newark, NJ.",1

I am impressed by the friendliness of the staff, the quality of shops and eateries, the cleanliness of the bathroom. Seriously impressed. I would be happy with an all day layover here!",1
2018-10-13,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,immigration process took nearly 2 hours,True," For transitting from international flight to a domestic flight, the immigration process took nearly 2 hours. Moreover, it was terrible for transitting here overnight. Since my connecting flight was the next day, I could not check-in. There were a few seats opposite the check-in counters. I did not sleep well in these seats. However, after checked-in and cleared customs, I could go to the sleeping area which provide many mats for free.",-1

Extremely unhelpful and poorly staffed auto rental facility! Building design not wheelchair friendly. Long distances to get anywhere. Gate area vending machines and snack shops extremely bad condition, either not working or poorly maintained and totally inadequate. Never saw a smiling face. anywhere in the airport!",-1
2018-02-22,0.1,Business,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,understaffed and inefficient,False,"  This airport is like a third world country. Endless walking, moving sidewalks and trams that are out of service. There are minimal food choices in Concourse B and those few that are available are grossly understaffed and inefficient. I am a frequent business traveler and all I can say is that if you have any choice at all, avoid MSP airport at all costs!",-1
2018-02-15,0.4,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,restricted restaurant and bar ordering,False,"  I feel compelled to lodge a critique about the way the airport has restricted restaurant and bar ordering to the iPads permanently located on the table tops. They have a beautiful full bar and restaurant at the gate we were waiting for hours. I went up to ask for a pint and was directed to order via the iPad. I asked if I could just pay cash and was denied. I think MSP needs to be careful not to get so technologically full of themselves as to restrict business. The iPads on all the tables photograph really well as high-tech, but make the assumption that all people want to go through the tedious process of online ordering. I went to another vendor and purchased a packaged drink for cash in 30 seconds and brought it back with me.",1
2017-12-04,0.4,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,it is absolutely abysmal,True, I don’t know who designed the layout of this airport but it is absolutely abysmal! There is little to nothing about it’s design that makes navigating this place convenient at all. That being said the airport was much cleaner than others I’ve been to and the restraunts were all very nice. I’m surprised with such a large remodel and billions of dollars invested that this is all they came up with.,-1
2017-11-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,lack of humanity experienced,False," While technology and design are key components of current air travel, the lack of humanity experienced across the board-from baggage check to restaurant / vending has left me frustrated. Staff on their phones, poor food, and no one to speak with. No descript pricing. Not good.",-1
2017-09-14,0.4,Family Leisure,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,shame passenger pick up is not non-smoking,False, It is a complete shame that baggage claim and passenger pick up is not non-smoking. Everybody comes out and lights their cigarette up right outside the doors which makes all non-smokers have to breathe in the smoke. It's terrible. Non-smokers should not be forced to breathe in the smoke.,1
