2022-10-20,0.9,Business,1,5,,5.0,0.0,,5.0,5.0,Way to problem solve Veronica,False,"  Shoutout to Veronica, ground transportation dispatcher. After a very long day of travel from Nova Scotia I finally arrived at Savannah airport a little after midnight only to find that no Uber or Lyft rides were available and there was a very long line at the taxi stand. When I got to the window where Veronica was managing a list of ride requests, I learned that the wait was 1 to 2 hours. Empty taxi's dribbled in and veronica, always with a smile bellowed out the next name on the list is all directions. People were growing impatient with the pace and the next taxi to show up was a mini van. After exchanging a few private words with the driver, Veronica changed strategies, put her list down and bellowed anyone going to ""fill in the blank"", in my case downtown, ""hop in"". I got a ride with 2 other fares in a van after only 1/2 hr wait. Way to problem solve Veronica. Everyone wins including the taxi driver who made a few extra$$. In case anyone wants to know the issue was related to a train stopped across the main roadway access for over an hour.",1
2021-10-02,0.4,Solo Leisure,2,1,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,I’ve never felt so insulted,False,"  SAV Airport is the only place to rent cars from, the process seems seamless but it’s not. For people coming from a flight directly to the airport it is but for locals it can be a headache with the parking of their actual vehicles. The woman at Thrifty counter was beyond helpful she made this experience so seamless and easy. The lady at the exit point for ticket collecting was rude and unprofessional. I’m usually a nice person but she had the nerve to say this is why people need to know how to read when we were trying to exit following the directions given to us since we had to cross load our vehicles. I’ve never felt so insulted.",-1
2021-04-24,0.2,Family Leisure,2,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,It was filthy,False,"  Coming from a large airport (Chicago) I was expecting better service and cleanliness in Savannah, GA. The security employees were pushy. Unfriendly, and rude to my three young sons as they were walking thru security. We arrived at our gate, only to find food and wrappers all over the ground. It was filthy. For a Saturday, we were surprised to find restaurants closed. I'd choose O'Hare and it's massiveness and cleanliness over this airport.",-1
2021-04-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,There was no one to meet us,True, I had requested assistance the night before our flight. There was no one to meet us when we initially arrived to head to Las Vegas and even though our entire flight there and back home the other airports had someone to meet us. When we flew back home no one was there to meet us and we had to wait for them to find someone. From now on we will choose another airport to fly out of and into.,-1

",True," I loved Savannah but will never return because I never want to step foot in this airport again. Not only was every single food option closed at 8pm, the vending machines were broken as well. Literally the worst airport ever. Never coming back to Savannah.",-1
2018-06-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,2,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,no baggage claim personnel present,False,"  Baggage arrived on an earlier flight, no baggage claim personnel present at the office until numerous phone calls and asking for help. 30 minutes later a lady arrived who was not helpful and kept saying she could not release my bag to me without the claim ticket which I had in my hand. After a few minutes of asking what I needed she finally actually looked at the claim ticket saying I’m sorry that’s all I need.",-1
