2024-09-02,0.1,Family Leisure,2,3,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,awful attitudes of the staff,False,"  We had a terrible experience at this airport mainly due to the awful attitudes of the staff.  We had orders barked at us and when we didn't understand something or failed to digest things said to us, we were shouted at like we were in a boot camp which I found very intimidating. I has my young son with me too. The staff are extremely unprofessional and when I said to the security worker that its also very stressful for us as passengers, she said ""I'm just doing my job"". No it's not your job to shout, intimidate and scare people. Its your job to remain calm, professional and give clear instructions. Not shout at ppl which scares them that much they're unable to digest what is being said. If I wasn't so tired & in a hurry to catch my flight I would have said way more and put her in a place. Also the girl checking passports & boarding passes screamed at me that much, her supervisor had to come and tell her to calm down. She didn't tell me what she wanted me to hand over, just shoved her hand out so I gave her passports and passes. She shouted I don't need those stop confusing everything just give me the passports. She was literally shouting at me.  They need to be trained better as I'm absolutely disgusted.",-1
2024-09-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Worst TSA experience ever,False," Worst TSA experience ever! 30 booths and only 4 open. Had 2 hours to catch my connection and missed it, because of horrible organization of this airport! Staff kept on saying ""everyone has a flight to catch"" - well, they were not ones to miss the flight due lack of urgency on their part. Cost me $400 to get a hotel to catch another flight the next morning, not even counting my lost time. Never again will I fly by that airport.",-1
2024-08-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,"no nearby restrooms"" ",True,   Why are there no nearby restrooms for people coming in internationally? This is terrible. The employees are  unprofessional and will yell while you’re standing right by them. Not yelling at me but just yelling and screaming at passengers in general. The bathrooms (when I finally ran through the place) were disgusting. You could tell they were not properly and regularly cleaned. This was hands down the worst experience I’ve had at any airport and I will do my absolute best to never have to transfer to/from here again.,-1
2024-06-22,0.3,Family Leisure,4,2,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,TSA was horrible,False,"   TSA was horrible and gave us an incredibly bad feeling after bullying us through the screening. I didn’t get any names because we were concerned of staying longer than necessary, but one of the lead females were incredibly rude and treating her own co workers just as terribly. We understand everything TSA goes through and we are grateful for a team that secures our safety but that does not  give someone the right to yell at me or my wife! My wife is pregnant and they were savages about getting us through and getting a female to pat down my wife. We fly all the time and this is the ONLY time we had a TSA issue. I will be reporting this further if we have more problems, this needs to be brought to the attention of the employees and the culture needs to shift away from negative attitude to helpful security!",-1
2024-06-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,4,4.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,,airport is so overrun,True,"  This airport is so overrun that I had to wait an hour for Uber to make it through traffic to the pickup area, and it took us another 30 mins to get out. The cops were shouting at drivers and people as well, not decent cop behavior. The AT&T cell service was overrun, too (showing all bars but not able to text or make a call). Won’t be coming through here again!",-1
2024-06-06,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,,Deeply disappointed,False,"   We got in on a late flight to find long lines, disgusting restrooms, traffic problems, baggage backups, airport subway train closed at 12:15 which led to an excessively long walk to car and backtrack to terminal and no response on the valet phone for car. Deeply disappointed and embarrassed that this is an international airport.",-1
2024-05-29,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,1.0,,5.0,1.0,“Passengers are treated like cattle”,False," Of all the airports I have visited, this IAH airport is probably the worst. Which is surprising as I'm comparing it with airports in a few economically poor countries. The airport people seem disinterested in their jobs. Even minor rains are treated as major disasters, causing everyone to take shelters indefinitely. From experience, the wait times for baggage to be delivered is easily 1-2 hours more than the time for baggage delivery in countries like Japan, London,UAE, Ireland, and Italy. In fact, the fastest baggage delivery I've seen was at the Mumbai airport in India - the bags arrived before we reached the baggage claim. Coming back to IAH, international flights struggle to find a docking gate at terminal E. Terminal E is best described as a shanty at this point due to repairs/renovations that hopefully will conclude during my lifetime. We were forced to sit on tarmac for hours after a long flight. Passengers are treated like cattle - beware, if you're requesting wheelchairs, you'll probably be wheeled around the next day if you're lucky. Sad.",-1
2024-05-18,0.2,Business,1,2,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,Terminal E is bad,False,"   Terminal E is bad. Probably the worst I have seen. I’m not sure how an international terminal can be so small and not have any amenities, restaurants, etc. on both departure and arrival. Something needs to be done to upgrade this terminal.",-1
2024-05-18,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,immigration takes ages,False,"   Worst possible airport, immigration takes ages, security check socks, signs are inadequate, arrogant staff, no help on hand, poor facilities, over crowded. By any standard, this is the worst experience I ever had",-1
2024-03-15,0.1,Business,1,1,2.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,“cannot support this corporate greed”,True, Staff at TSA and CBP even more rude than normal - I understand this is a cowboy state but you don’t have to treat people like cattle by yelling commands at them. Long line at global entry so what is the advantage of having it? At other airports I just breeze through. Prices for food have reached levels that I’m not willing to tolerate any more. More than $15 for a prepacked old Turkey sandwich at CIBO that I in addition would have to check out myself is simply unacceptable even though I could expense it. I simply cannot support this corporate greed! Toilets smell like in a 3rd world country. To use the “free” WiFi a ton of personal data is collected - no thank you!,-1
2024-02-20,0.6,Couple Leisure,2,4,4.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,,able to breeze through Immigration,True,"  Transited through Terminal E (International terminal). The airport is massive and the distances from domestic terminal to international terminal are vast. Terminal E has a wide spacious open concourse with all the amenities. Seating is plentiful at the Gates. Give yourself plenty of time 2h.5 hrs minimum to make connecting flights. The distances from the gates to Immigration and Customs are very long. The terminal was very crowded however with Mobile Passport Control, we were able to breeze through Immigration. The only drawback is that one has to exit the secured area and go through TSA security all over again with very long lines. From the transfer area one has to take the train to reach the domestic terminals. The free airport WiFi is very fast.",1
2023-09-30,0.3,Family Leisure,2,2,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,screening process is excessive,False,"  Overpricing is a bit worse here than other airport shops I've seen. The screening process is excessive and very time consuming. Unsure if it is generalized, but on our screening, the TSA agent was one of the least courteous, rudest, pushiest, most impatient i have seen. Watched her shout at an elderly man at least 4-5x to empty his pockets while he was trying to do so. She showed no respect, no patience, and no courtesy. Extremely memorable and unpleasant experience.",-1
2023-09-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,really heavy screening,True,"  One of the worst arrival and transfer experiences I've ever had. Long lines - even with advanced traveller programs (Global Entry + TSA Precheck). Just horrible - really heavy screening, questions, etc. Almost missed my 90 min connection time. Global Entry is basically useless - they take your pic like everywhere else - and then you have to go through all the passport checking, 30 questions. Then you have to walk really far to get your bag and to recheck your bag to final destination. Then you take a train to another terminal where only half the train doors opened,  then run to make a connecting flight.",-1
2023-09-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,departure staff at check-in were incompetent,False,  Upon arrival had to wait over an hour in passport control. Upon departure staff at check-in were incompetent. Said I was overweight and had to take out 5 items and go back to the end of the check in line and wait 45 min again! Seriously the dumbest thing that has ever happened to me and I have been traveling by air for 50 years.,-1
2023-08-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,5,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,,international pickup area is torture,False, The international arrival pickup area (terminal E) is a torture. Too crowded (jam packed with people on a narrow street side corridor/barrier) - outdoors with little shade - and it takes 45 minutes and an hour last year for our ride to snake around the terminals to get to you. Not nice when it is 100F outside. Or any time. They have construction going in - but it was the same a year ago and doesn't look like they are prioritizing this area. Worst i've ever experienced. It's a mad house. So chill when going thru this gauntlet. Really is bad for IAH to put people thru this.,-1
2023-08-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,Not suitable for families,True,  Easily one of the worst airports in the world. Just spent 12 hours stuck here with 3 kids. There was no care from any staff. They all pretty much just sit there and say it is what it is. Used to love Texas but the airport experience here will make our family think twice before ever visiting again because of the airport experience. Not suitable for families.,-1
2023-08-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Customer service is non-existent,False,"  Worst airport. Very much like all the other reviews. Customer service is non-existent. Workers are rude, slow, shout at you, and make an already hectic airport, a challenging experience. I will never travel through this airport again if I don’t have to. This is the only airport where you have a two hour layover and can barely make your next flight due to all the lines you need to go through when you’re traveling internationally. There are never enough custom lanes open. The security lines are long and make you fear that you will miss your flight.",-1
2023-05-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,1,,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,no customer seating at the gates,False,"  Taking a trip from United at Terminal C. I was amazed to find there is no customer seating at the gates. Everyone is looking for a place to sit and mostly sitting in restaurant seating which are few bathrooms are dirty, poorly serviced.",-1
2023-05-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,unorganized and unclean,True," The airport is unorganized and unclean. Food courts lack clean dining tables, the seats are uncomfortable at any gate, they lack adequate and up-to-date ATM machines, and the signs directing people are straight up confusing.",-1
2023-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,Signage is more confusing than ever,True,"  I've used this airport close to 30 times. It used to be an okay airport but has really gone downhill. The construction around Terminal E is a complete disaster. On the positive side, staff were prompt and friendly with taking care of my wife, who needs a wheelchair to go any distance. TSA's staff, who is usually exceptionally rude at IAH, were decent this time. That's where the positives end. Signage is more confusing than ever, the tiny trains between terminals are completely inadequate. The worst part is passenger pickup. Rather than drive, we used Lyft. Getting to IAH wasn't bad. Getting picked up was a nightmare. Traffic was gridlocked as was the narrow sidewalk. No one was in charge, just airport staff randomly blowing whistles. After an hour of this nonsense and our Lyft driver unable to reach us, we slowly made our way back to the terminal and went to Terminal C to arrange pick up. A lot of other folks had the same idea but it wasn't nearly as chaotic as at the former Terminal E. It's clear no thought whatsoever has gone into compensating for construction issues. I'm afraid the situation is ripe for a serious incident, especially with summer coming up.  It's embarrassing people visiting Houston for the first time are subjected to such an incompetently run airport.",-1
2023-05-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,3,,3.0,,,,1.0,security staff were rude and unclear,True,"  This is the worst airport we have ever gone through. The security staff were rude and unclear in their instructions then got annoyed if you didn't do something exactly right. They shouted to put all electronics in a box outside of your bags for security which was fine. Didn't specify these weren't to be on top of each other (we have never did that in any other airport, as long as they were in the tray its been fine) the aggressive woman at security took my husbands tray off the belt and basically threw it at him almost smashing his phone in the process but didn't give clear instruction as to what she wanted him to do. Same with my things, removed our trays about 3 times with no clear instruction.  The security staff were so rude, unhelpful, unclear and shouldn't be working with the public with their attitudes.  I must say the man we had at passport control was incredibly lovely and we enjoyed a conversation about family and kids. But from beginning the experience with this man, it was ruined by security. We can't comment on seating, shopping, WiFi or food and beverages as our connecting flight was really quick.",-1
2023-05-01,0.9,Couple Leisure,4,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,Everyone was very helpful,True,  My husband has cancer and has mobility issues. He needed wheelchair assistance to the plane. This airport has many electric carts that can pick people up and deliver them to the gate. We had assistance both with wheelchair staff and cart staff. Everyone was very helpful. We were able to get around without a lot of stress.,1
2023-04-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,don't want anyone to feel welcome,False," The first employees you get contact with when arriving from out of US all seem to hate their jobs. There were nicer, more polite Drill Instructors in basic training. These people are many travelers first impression of the US. Being a US citizen returning to the states I was appalled at the head em up, move em out, rawhide! approach to moving people through whatever multiple inspection required. No actual direction, very poor signage, rude demanding ""ambassadors"" of the US. Not every person travels daily through airports, think about that as areas are designed and signed. If you don't like your job---find a new one. In one of multiple herding lines I heard very kind people say I'm not from the America's, wanting some guidance or information. The responses were not helpful to anyone, unkind and sometimes down right nasty. This airport is not only may peoples first impression of the US, it is also peoples impression of Texas. Apparently Texans and their international airport don't want anyone to feel welcome. With all the herding, I have no idea about any shopping or food choices because if my flight hadn't been delayed. I would have missed it.",-1
2023-03-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,3.0,2.0,Will this ever end?,True," It is still a misery being picked up at International Arrivals at IAH. For the majority this misery comes after a 10+ hour flight. I have never seen so many passengers on the phone shaking their head. Will this ever end? The slogan 'change is coming to IAH' sounds OK, but when will this change arrive. The damage to the reputation of IAH will last decades. This is a long and very poorly planned endeavour leading to high levels of frustration. I may change my opinion once the long awaited and promised change has come.",-1
2023-02-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,4,4,1.0,4.0,0.0,,,,no seats for passengers,False," Beautiful airport, BUT I am 64 years old and when I got to the gate there were no seats for passengers to sit in while they waited. There were tables and seats for a restaurant and 7 seats for people to use and charge computers. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! Every other airport I have ever gone to had plenty of seats at the gates. Houston, you are pathetic! You spent lots of money to make your airport beautiful then forgot to seat your customers. And there are a lot of older people who fly. You have now taken sole possession of the worst large airport I have ever been too. Congratulations! BTW, I flew United 1696 to Salt Lake City and was at Gate C-4.",-1
2023-02-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Confusing and unprofessional,False, Confusing and unprofessional. At the customer support there seems to be only one person who knew what to do. The rest of the people didnt know what to do and kept having to get someone who did know. They were not very friendly or helpful either.,-1
2023-01-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"Dusty, cold, dirty",False,"  Flight IAH-EWR from Terminal D (D9). I started freezing once up on the escalators and went to the restaurant there. Everybody was wearing coats and scarfs because it was just cold. I went to the gate and looked around. I did not know Terminal D is also a construction zone. Dusty, cold, dirty areas at Gate 9. No isolation, no carpet, no ceiling. This is just another part that IAH is losing it's reputation and rating for years to come. It will take time once the construction is done.",-1
2022-12-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,No comfortable place to try to rest,False, Terrible airport. Because of my delayed arriving flight I had to spend the night. Employees are rude and unhelpful. No remotely comfortable place to even try to rest. Dirty and it smells.,-1
2022-12-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,poor planning and lack of signage,False," Twice in the past 30 days we went to the airport to pick up family members arriving into Terminal A. We waited patiently in the cell phone lot until they got their bags then headed to the terminal to pick them up. Traffics to Terminal A is a nightmare and it doesn’t appear to be due to construction, its just poor planning and lack of signage to keep people in their correct lanes and moving smoothly. The first time in mid-Nov it took me at least 25 min from the time I left the cell phone lot until we got to the terminal. Today, after waiting in the long line for nearly 20-25 min when we arrived at the pick up door it is not apparent that there is more than 1 door to pick up a nor is it apparent from inside the terminal either. We were at the pickup spot waiting for our passengers who were traveling with a small child to find us. Unfortunately they were at a different door. As we tried on the phone to find each other the parking attendants who were very unprofessional and extremely rude ordered us to drive away. I was almost insistent that we weren’t going to leave since we knew my son, daughter-in-law and their toddler daughter were with all their bags looking for us somewhere and furthermore, not knowing that there was another passenger pickup door did not want to go back in the long line of traffic that I just finished wasting my time in for the past half hour. Finally one of the attendant got so indignant I thought he was either going to get physical with me or call the police on me so we elected to drive around to the other pick up door (which we did not even know existed). When we got over to the other side the parking was just as chaotic as we looked for our family. I knew I wasn’t going to leave the terminal from there until we picked them up because that would have put us going into another 20-30 minute long line of traffic. We were finally able to find each other but the entire ordeal from leaving the cellphone lot to pick up was right at an hour.",-1
2022-11-09,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,everywhere was electronic,True,"  You can not simply order a meal and a beer everywhere was electronic, so if your phone decides not to work prepare to be hungry and thirsty. They should have a back up, but the staff has no choice but to apologize and are helpless.",-1
2022-10-31,0.5,Business,2,2,3.0,2.0,0.0,,3.0,,inconsistent experience depending where you are,True," Somewhat messy, with inconsistent experience depending where you are. Flew 4 times through IAH in the last few weeks and I have not been impressed. In addition, access to the airport is somewhat messy and we had to wait in line to get on a shuttle bus from and to car rental. Not sure why it was so busy. I think the experience can vary wildly depending on which gates you fly from.",-1
2022-10-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,bathroom looks like it has never been cleaned,True," Landed at IAH for a connecting flight to Phoenix and the first thing you get hit with is the smell of disgust, awful smells. Walk into the bathroom and it looks like it has never been cleaned or maybe not since the beginning of the year. Sit at the bar the prices are the worst I have seen at an airport and there is no customer service - what the heck? Hello bartender are you here? Would never come back here ever. Never been to Houston and never even want to based off the airport.",-1
2022-10-05,0.3,Family Leisure,4,1,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,always find it confusing,False," I have traveled to and from this airport several times. I always find it confusing where to go next. I find the easiest way is to follow the other passengers. We had been asked to check our carry on luggage as the flight was very full. There was no information where the luggage would show up. Each carousel we went to did not have our flight information. So as one carousel started up, Travellers scurried over hoping their luggage would appear. We should have had the theme music from Benny Hill playing overhead. The restrooms could use a face-lift. They are not only very well used but usually gross. New toilet seats at least, and more frequently cleaning would help a great deal.",-1
2022-09-16,0.1,Business,1,1,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,The signage is terrible,True,"  What matters is whether it’s easy to get in and out of the airport, find my gate, and whether bathrooms are clean. IAH fails across the board. The signage is terrible. If you’re parking in a garage on site, good luck finding it based on the signs and once you do find the garages, you better have a reservation otherwise you’ll be directed to a parking lot offsite. That’ll add a solid 45 minutes. Once in the airport, I hope your not in terminal E because if you are, prepare for more very confusing signage and a long walk through other terminals to get to E. The employees here are friendly and helpful, and thank goodness because you’ll be searching for one after the signage frustrates you. IAH, this is beneath you. Clean up the signs (I suggest going digital so you can update things for construction). Improve the parking. Invest in the infrastructure, not the shopping",-1
2022-08-23,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,turmoil going from one gate to another,True,"  We are Kiwis in transit through this hellish airport. Never in my life have we seen such turmoil going from one gate to another and hard to follow instructions..we were diverted to Dallas and return to Houston to find only small customs staff on . Only 6 gates open on 10 gates closed, 2 to 3 thousand people waited for around 3 hours to clear customs. Shocking...my fingerprints taken again. Stupid little train trundles around shifting people between gates, totally inadequate its a joke. Trying to find help or taxis a joke. Do not fly here and do expect Air New Zealand help at the airport, they won't be there. Departure gate D has 1 small coffee shop, that's it, people Q for gates and you can hardly get past them. Why on earth it this airport rated so well.",-1
2022-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Long lines to get through customs,False,"  I was so embarrassed that this was our home airport. Flew home from Istanbul to Houston on August 1, 2022 terminal E. Long lines to get through customs, only a few windows open and officers obviously did not want to be there, most were moving very slow and rude. Got to baggage and our belt broke after only a few suitcases were gotten, had to wait 30 minutes while they fixed it instead of using one of the others. Then out to mass chaos to wait to be picked up, only one officer trying to keep things moving. Took our ride over an hour to get to us. After landing we didn’t get home until 3 1/2 hours later. This is totally unacceptable for an airport that is rated so high. I told my husband we would drive to another city before using this airport again.",-1
2022-07-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,3,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,avoid this connection in the future,False,"  I flew in from Buenos Aires and arrived at 5:30 a.m. on 7/29. Fantastic flight crew on United. Customs agents were upbeat and friendly even at the early hour. Those working the baggage recheck for connecting flights and security check to gates were extremely rude. I’m embarrassed that this might be someone’s first impression of our country. A woman literally yelling at people to move faster, on the top of her lungs. Over and over. Several young ladies being pushy in the security line - treating people like they were stupid. I’ve traveled quite a bit out of the country. I don’t know any other languages and I have never had anyone act like that ever. If you work in the international terminal there should be an understanding of a language barrier. And honestly just be kind and informative - not a bully. Not a good look Houston. Will avoid this connection in the future.",-1
2022-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,failure at Terminal E,True," I'm having a hard time to find words about the failure at Terminal E/Intl Arrivals. For the second time I had to go through the misery. Once I left the building there was no way turning back. Officers yelling keep going, BUT there was no way to 'go'. Carts blocking the whole walkway and people are getting angry. This will destroy the IAH reputation for years to come. After long 10 hours plus flights people have to go through the failure of planning the construction. Nobody there to clear the luggage carts, nobody handing out water in the heat and everybody involved seemed to be overwhelmed or resigned since this is going on for so long. This crisis and chaos needs manpower and some brain to get some ease. Clear carts, water, support - all non existence for weeks and month now. Why not have shuttle buses to the whatever lot to clear out and ease the failure mess. I said it and will do again: ""How can this have been so poorly been planned?"" Who is responsible for the canned reputation of IAH? It took 2 hours in the heat to get picked up and I was lucky.",-1
2022-06-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,This airport really is an embarrassment,False,"  Someone please fire the airport director. This airport really is an embarrassment. I’ve travelled the world and never seen such an amateur show. The current construction works have been so poorly thought through that passengers arriving at multiple terminals are all funnelled into one passenger pick up area. Hundreds of tired and fed up people squeezing along between temporary barriers trying to get close to the road for their pick-up, all in the Texas summer heat. Cars arriving to pick up passengers are also squeezed into 1 then 2 lanes meaning there’s constant chaos at the pick up point. The police have zero effect. They just blow their whistles and aggressively wave at cars that are already moving the way they’re waving. TSA and immigration staff are also unnecessarily rude. Today I watched an immigration officer tell a traveler “take your ugly damn hat off” - utterly unprofessional and surely not the image the USA wants to portray to the world. Avoid this airport if you possibly can.",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,,An embarrassment for Houston,False,"  Construction and lane closures has made getting in and out of C terminal impossible. I waited literally 50 minutes to go about half a mile. I am not exaggerating. Totally unacceptable. An embarrassment for Houston. This is our international airport and face to the world? There is one car ramp to get to terminals CDE and once you're on it, there is no turning back or turning around or finding an alternate route. If there had been an emergency and an ambulance or fire truck had to get through, then forget about it. It's a serious public safety issue. Besides the ramp, there is another road full of cars that feeds into CDE, so you have multiple lanes of traffic funnelled into a bottleneck of two lanes: one lane is used officially to drop off and pick up DE passengers; the other lane meant for traffic to continue on to C terminal is used in reality to also drop off and pick up DE passengers. So both lanes become blocked. And there is no one there to direct people to move on from the two lanes. Bad for you if you have to drop off or pick up at DE. And super bad for you if you need to make it through that blockage so that you can actually get to C terminal. Houston Airport System, did you not think this through? You've done a horrible job planning. And you're doing a horrible job rectifying the mess of your lack of planning. Open up some lanes and hire employees to direct traffic!",-1

I walked to multiple terminals to find someone to assist me. There was no one there to assist anyone. I finally went to the United first class lounge and a kind woman assisted me, although she told me she wasn't supposed to. Not everyone flying is accustomed to using smart phones to assist them and staff are needed at the terminals. Our luggage was lost for several days, and the only people who assisted were the Lake Charles and Baton Rouge United staff. I tried calling Lafayette, and no one answered the United phone",-1
2022-04-27,0.4,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,The Airport is difficult to use,False,"  The Airport is difficult to use as the Concourses are very large with massive distances between in Concourse gates. For example gates 7-8-9 are close together and the next gates may be a football field distance away. There is an incredible amount of commercial space between gates making the distance between gates large. The Signage is poor and confusing with only arrows that point to Terminal/Concourse directions. Concourse C actually is in two buildings separated by a long distance. There should be fast people moving sidewalks all over the place. There are Airport maps but few and far between. I saw one. During my visit there was a severe weather problem so all planes were rerouted or held. Gate changes occurred frequently. I chased my plane from E to B, to C33 and o er to C9, back to B and back to C9. By then I was exhausted. I caught a handicapped ride from B to C once. The only solution I have is to cut the commercial space or put in rapid people moving sidewalks everywhere. I will avoid this airport in the future.",-1

2022-04-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,how awful the TSA people are to travelers,True,"  Arriving was a nice experience, everything was organized, professional attitude from Customs and Immigration staff and the arrival areas. The difference is at departure! I arrived and departed on the same day so I experienced the whole process in one. Many airlines do not have assigned counters until 3 hours before a flight so if you need to contact the airline anytime before that 3-hour window, there is no option! My departure flight was scheduled for 7:33 pm and it was delayed to 8:50 pm, I was at the airport at 3 pm with a web check-in boarding pass that didn´t work and NO counter for help until 5 pm. As soon as the boarding pass issue was finally solved then Security TSA barking and having just one machine for 6 flights so the queue and the mess was horrible only to be barked at when it was the turn to pass through the machine. Trying to find something simple and affordable to eat and the cheapest option was Wendy´s where the smallest combo was $12.79 and a regular small coffee was $4.49. I can go on and on about other stuff but I just can put more energy into recalling how bad Terminal D is, how awful the TSA people are to travelers.",-1

They yell at the lines about stuff no one understands instead of using a speaker. I think they enjoy yelling. I travel a lot and this is the worst. They have this conveyor belt system. You are not allowed to fetch your own tray like 99% of all other airports. If you go to push the tray like you are used to, you are barked at. If you are not exactly on the line, barked at. You are not even allowed to carry your wallet through the checkpoint. DC was a smooth cakewalk compared to this. I will pay to avoid this airport in the future. Right now I am sitting sideways in a seat because it is bolted to the ground made for the size of a child. I am not even a big guy. Don't even get me started on how bad United is. They also installed some self checkout system at the bar. I am not paying for that. I really have come to dislike the USA. Mexico provides first class service compared to this.",-1

2022-03-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,How can this be so poorly be planned?,True," The arrival at IAH due to construction is a nightmare right now. After deplaning the baggage belt in Terminal C area was packed like crazy and no way to do any social distancing. After getting in to our pick up car the chaos unfolded. It was about 7.30 pm and the bottleneck turned into gridlock. No car able to move and numerous cars honking. There was nobody and I have to say it again 'nobody' out there directing any traffic. Frustration levels heating up and honking for over 15 minutes and I mean hundreds of cars. The whole ordeal took an hour. The same or worse situation yesterday at the Terminal E (International arrivals) area. There is one left lane and it took 2 hours to get there to pick up my wife. Passengers were more than upset after mostly 10+ hours flights to go through that experience. If this happens every day the amount of ""IAH hate"" that will accumulate over the construction time will take decades to ease. How can this be so poorly be planned? To avoid the image and reputation loss during construction better planning and execution of this 'plan' would have been a not so bad idea.",-1

The TSA agents at IAH right off the bat were incredibly rude, I understand dealing with people can be difficult and they don’t have to be nice per se, but making fun of people out loud right in front of their face is pretty low. The airport itself may show off how many restaurants and shops it has but the purpose of an airport is to fly people around. The employees driving vehicles gave little regard to people walking around them, the terminals are laid out very backwards, and there is little seating room at the terminals.",-1

2021-11-21,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,She was atrocious at best,True,"  My wife, daughter and I just checked in for an early morning flight to D.C. and our experience started off horribly wrong from the time we walked into Terminal C. We pre-paid for baggage well in advance and had our electronic boarding passes and baggage receipt at the ready; however, the United employee at the baggage desk was adamant that we hadn’t paid and we held up the line for a solid ten minutes with her aggressively repeating herself that we hadn’t pre-paid. Finally, she calmed down and decided to help us. We are still trying to figure out what happened and why it happened. We then made our way to the TSA Clear check-in and the first agent we encountered in no way deserves an employment opportunity that involves human contact. She was atrocious at best and I am thankful she is not empowered to carry a weapon in her position - she is dangerous! I do not suffer from any type of anxiety but after our check-in experience, I feel like I have been chased - and to think, we actually paid for the experience months in advance and went through the TSA pre-check interviews and all of the requirements only to be belittled, degraded, and treated like trash. As a resident of the greater Houston area, I am ashamed at what my family just experienced as it is a reflection of not only this airport but also the area in which we live and the people who live here. There is obvious change needed in this country right now and a great place to start would be Bush Intercontinental Airport.

I suggest you send them to Middle Eastern airports, they could learn a lot about efficiency and respect. Shame on the TSA for allowing this pathetic behavior in its workers. I'm guessing they all lead pretty miserable lives and it makes them feel better to treat everyone like dirt. Maybe you could offer them therapy or anger management. These workers are way too highly strung to be working with the public and it will end with one or more of these losers killing someone. Perhaps it's time to disband this ""organization"" because I doubt you will do anything to change this cop/prison guard attitude you have going on right now.",-1

Besides my kids, I had two car seats, a suitcase, a diaper bag, a couple of other small bags to drag around, which was impossible to do myself. Though it was a busy morning at the airport (August 6th), this woman helped me out with carrying my stuff and letting me cut in line and just went above and beyond overall.",1

It took us 2 hours to get through Customs. There was an estimated 1000 to 2000 passengers waiting in the Terminal E to show Passports. Out of the 40 or so Customs Lanes available only 5 were being used. Once we finally got through that, our luggage was spread out all over the baggage claim area. Once we claimed our baggage, we went through TSA where we were yelled at and threated by a woman who said things like ""pay attention"" there was no clear guidance on anything, and ""I wish one of you would lose your cool"" basically trying to pick a fight. Passengers have no say so in what the policies are when going through TSA, no clear directions, no TSA agent guiding us to the right lines to get into. So unprofessional.",-1

We must travel to France routinely to visit family, but each time we paid $300-$500 more than had we flown out of Austin, Dallas, or even LA! I just checked flights to Paris today and the difference between Houston and Austin is nearly $400 per ticket!

2021-04-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,They were rude and downright hostile,False,  This was by far the most stressful and negative experience in my travel history. The whole set up was a mess and the entry point to check into customs was completely out of compliance for COVID-19. They were so understaffed that we made our connection by the skin of our teeth. Never again. The worst was the absolutely bad attitude the TSA projected. They were rude and downright hostile. The only good point was the golf cart driver that was amazing. He did everything he could to get us to our gate and showed genuine empathy for our situation.,-1

Food prices are  inflated. Most businesses do not accept cash, can’t print out a paper receipt (they want to send it to your email address or phone number).  Food and other items are ordered on tablet computers. If I have to pay $10 for a taco or $6 for a cup of coffee I would like to have some human interaction. Very few vendors speak any language other than English. On the other hand, most of the vendors are friendly and polite, if you can find them.

Who gives them to right to treat people like that! Now if that gentleman would of stuck up for himself he would of been in the wrong! Will never fly through there again just for that!

I asked where TSA precheck was (apparently I went to the wrong checkpoint) and did not tell me until I finally got through. The TSA staff stated ""if you didn't want to take it your electronics you should have went thru TSA precheck line"". Funny, I didn't know that was an option.

Firstly, where is this message told to the passengers before buying or carrying, secondly, why is there no alternate method to test something that is not transparent? Instead they gave me two options, either leave my bottle which cost over $120 or pay extra $30 and go through security again (my flight was about to leave). Why isn’t this conveyed to people before!? Why do I have to lose the money I paid for something they can’t convey prior to me buying? I’m really frustrated by this.",-1

2020-02-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,TSA employees absolutely awful,False,"  TSA employees at this airport were absolutely awful. I asked if I needed to remove anything from my knapsack Like an iPad and was told no. On the other side my bag was flagged I was told I was supposed to have taken out my iPad. Everyone around me had done the same. Signage would have helped. They took it out, but then kept Rescanning my bag. Each time someone would take my bag and walk very very slowly to the other end of the room and put it at the back of the line . So now it was something in my bag and not the iPad. By the 4th time they decided to check my bag. But the security woman was nasty towards me for showing signs of stress. I had been there for at least 40 min. Apparently I looked at my watch - I was told to stop doing that and to Calm down. She then proceeded to aggressively lecture me. I just said that if I had been informed at the beginning about the iPad all of this could be avoided. Never ever say anything. Lesson learned. Most airports I’ve been through don’t require iPads to be taken out.",-1
2020-01-12,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Customer service is extremely lacking,False,"  Customer service is extremely lacking here! First of all, the guy checking in our luggage moved so slowly, the longer line next to us moved twice as fast at least. I was worried our car seats might not make it on the plane because we had to run off to security. We couldn’t wait to watch him put them on the belt for checked luggage. He just sat them on the ground next to him and moved like a slug doing I don’t know what. The airport is giant and you can’t see the TSA PreCheck from the regular security check line. So I asked a lady, she pointed and said, ‘Over there.’ Ok, short and to the point. We went to find where ‘over there’ was. Found the TSA PreCheck line but it didn’t display our gate # overhead. So I asked if it was the line for TSA PreCheck to our gate because it didn’t list our gate number. She just said, ‘Do you see the TSA PreCheck sign?’ I was so shocked by the tone and response I paused for a moment and said, ‘I don’t see our gate listed.’ She said, 'You walk around'. Everyone in our party was taken aback and told her there was no need for the attitude, just a simple question. She just continued to be snippy. We rushed past in a hurry to get through. We showed up exactly two hours earlier than our 6am flight and everything took so long, we made it to our gate 10 minutes before boarding! Getting on the plane was such a relief to be welcomed with the customer service that the Seattle based flight crew of Alaska Airlines always brings!",-1

Unfortunately IAH airport has still not moved into understanding customer service. Firstly my global entry application was ignored with an X printed on my receipt and then my wife and what appeared to be all other passengers arriving on ESTAs also had x printed on immigration receipt. We then duly joined the queue which moved very slowly for over 1 hour 30 minutes before arriving in front of immigration lanes. Unfortunately it was now 3pm local time which resulted in at least 90% of the gates closing and our processing taking an additional 40 minutes. Fortunately for us we had allowed 3 hours transit time for our connecting flight to MIA or otherwise we would have been like many other passengers in missing their connecting flight.,-1

I overheard one worker say she didn’t need the job and she wasn’t going to deal with these people. One gentleman took me off the plane and left me sitting, my wife had to eventually push me because we had a connecting flight with a very short time limit due to sitting on the plane for a hour and a half, because first another plane was at our gate then the ramp would not line up with the plane.

I have several metal implants holding my spine together, and I told the TSA woman this. She insisted on doing her pat-down, which whatever, do your job, but she was so rude, and aggressive in her demeanour. She basically told me to shut up at least twice. Her partner was a man, and he was so embarrassed by her behaviour that he wouldn’t even look at me. It’s a very busy place, and once I went thru the full-body scanner, I didn’t hear it beep and there was no indication that I was not permitted to proceed, and it was someone else instructing me. So, I went to grab my things out of the grey box to get out of the way. She says to me, I didn’t say you could leave. Ok, I responded. Then she says, stand on that mat, and don’t move, but instead of asking as a normal person would, she’s talking to me like I’ve done something wrong. She then informs me she’s doing a pat-down, and she now has myself and two other ladies waiting for the same treatment. She then asks me if I have pain anywhere, I responded yes, I have pain in my back, she says again with needless aggression, I didn’t ask you about your back, I asked you if you have pain in the front (which was not what she said). She’s yelling this at me. She says I’m not patting down your back like I was somehow supposed to know what she meant! So, again I corrected myself, and I responded with no, I have no pain in my front. Then she does her pat-down but is going around my yoga pants waistband to my back and down my legs. Maybe the TSA could use a crash course to teach their representatives some basic anatomy as she most definitely was patting down my lower back. I also was holding my passport, you know normal behaviour to have your passport in hand in an airport, she says, put your passport down! Then she swabs my hands, she actually looked disappointed when she couldn’t find anything. Is this the way they treat visitors to their country? That was the most disgusting behaviour I’ve ever witnessed and experienced in an airport, ever! I’m all about keeping everyone safe, these safeguards are put in place to protect all of us, I agree with screening 100%. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. My disabilities are a big part of my life, and I do my best to fit in with everyone else, this woman should not have a job dealing with the public. She demonstrated quite proficiently that she has no regard for those with disabilities. Shame on you for treating people like this! You should be ashamed of yourself. My only regret is not getting her name. I will gladly pay more money next time, so I don’t have to go thru Houston.",-1

2019-10-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,one of the dirtiest I've ever been to,True," I've flown in and out of George Bush Intercontinental numerous times over the years. Honestly, this is a hard airport to like because it just seems stuck in 1989. But this is also a hard airport to truly dislike, as I've never had a particularly negative experience there. The biggest selling point for me is that I don't ever remember coming across rude or gruff personnel, even TSA during peak traffic hours. I'm sure a rude TSA or ticket agent exists at Bush, because it's a massive American airport after all, but I've thankfully never encountered them! They have a pretty cool display in (I believe) the American terminal which walks one through the evolution of Houston's space program history, nothing fancy or attention-calling, just factual with a few artifacts. There is a selection of decent bars and restaurants throughout, though not much in the way of anything Texas-specific that I can recall. Other than these things, the terminals are dirty. United's terminals are separated and disjointed. Security lines can be painfully slow if you don't have TSA Pre-Check or clear. The airport is honestly one of the dirtiest I've ever been to in the developed world - yes, I just reiterated the point! Seating is very crowed, and so are places to actually charge your phone, iPad, or Kindle. As I said, it looks like the airport hasn't been updated (or, in some cases, even cleaned) since 1989 - when George H.W. Bush, this airport's namesake, was actually president! Some parts of the airport have an indescribably strange smell that I can only describe as dank and damp. The WiFi connectivity is something I'd expect in a developing African country (or Australia, where it's also surprisingly bad). The shuttle bus system from and to economy parking lots is just chaotic and abnormally unsystematic - and illogical. Honestly, if the City of Houston could just improve the layout and dump a lot of money into modernization, Bush would honestly be an amazing airport! Until then, it's like an old lawnmower: just barely running on choke mode while sitting in idle. What a shame.",-1

Weather issues shut down the IAH airport shortly after arrival. No problem - completely understand. We came in on a 10.5 hour international flight and were trapped between customs and security points waiting on luggage. Very little seating. 150+ passengers. The airport personnel were not unloading luggage so we sat for over an hour. We were told not to worry about connecting flights, since the airport was shut down. Well luggage came and we heard the boarding call for our connection. We dashed to the security point. We had pre-TSA tickets but there was no pre-TSA line. TSA personnel just shrugged and told us we had to get in line. We made it through and heard our final boarding call. Our carry-ons went thru the scanner, were sitting in sight but we could not reach them. We very politely asked 2 different TSA staff just to please push our carry-ons about 3 feet where we could grab them - both shook their heads ""no"" and would not help us. So, when we could reach our stuff, we grabbed it and ran like the wind. I didn't even get my shoes on. Had to race 10 gates to get to our flight. Mind you, we are 60-something old and running through the airport is not something we need to be doing. Glad we still do some jogging or we would not have made it. We have a profoundly disabled son at home and we needed to get home to relieve our staff before the shift ended. We made it home by the skin of our teeth! We had given ourselves 5 extra hours just in case. Very stressful experience. I hope passengers from other countries don't think this is the way Americans are.",-1

",False,"  Don't go to this airport unless you want to queue up for at least 1.5 hrs whilst 3 officers check your passports and onward travel. There was in excess of 300 people behind us and as people became vitriolic about the wait a female agent approached the queue and threatened to remove them to the back of the queue if they continued to complain. By the time we got to the carousel to collect our cases, they had been taken off and put to one side. This has to be the worst airport in the US and the rest of the country's I've visited. I've given it 1 star but really dose not deserve any. Appalling introduction into the US.",-1

2019-05-08,0.5,Couple Leisure,5,5,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,where is common sense?,False,"  After a lovely visit to the United States, our New Zealand family had the worst experience ever at the Houston International Airport. Their flight was cancelled on Friday night and was not rescheduled until Sunday evening. After going through TSA and having a humiliating experience only to find out they were not going to be able to fly out until Sunday evening. The people at TSA were rude and had my sister-in-law go through a horrible screening. She has had 2 knee surgeries and told the TSA about it. They didn't care, they put this sweet lady through a humiliating screening. We understand safety, but where is common sense? After their flight was cancelled, Air New Zealand gave them accommodations for 1 night. They had to reclaim their baggage. That took until 1 am because a belt on the baggage claim was broken. They had an extra 48 hours in Houston at their expense. Sunday arrives and they finally believe that they will be able to board the plane for a 13 hour trip to return home. My sister-in-law was very nervous because of the previous experience with TSA. Again she explained that she had metal in her knees due to surgeries. The TSA agents were again rude and disrespectful. They put her through the humiliation again! Many people dislike Americans. They find us rude. It is unfortunate that some make a name for us all. This is not the America we want the world to see.",-1
2019-05-03,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,,arrival is amongst the worst ever,False," My arrival experience was very similar to that described by the previous reviewer. It was utterly shambolic and I have spent much time over the years arriving into US airports. This particular arrival is up there amongst one of the worst ever. The passport machines rejected over 90% of all applicants and help (though not needed by myself) was not readily forthcoming at all to other passengers; when another passenger asked for assistance she was told, ""no, not my problem. You should read it properly"" by a staff member. I was in another lengthy line for just over an hour after receiving a cross on the paper from the passport machine. Out of the many desks available for use only two were open that particular evening and there were no other officers around. What never helped matters either was having the airport greeters walk up and down the line with various accoutrements attached to them like clipboards and radio handsets (to show how important they are no doubt) telling passengers that it is not their fault and not the fault of the officers either!. At least the immigration officer I saw was friendly particularly when he realised that I shared the same birthday as he. Departures through Terminal D back to LHR has nothing much to write home about in terms of restaurants. Would suggest that you eat elsewhere before arriving here. Not many seats around the gate area of D7 either.",-1
2019-04-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,"inconsiderate, inept system",True," George Bush Airport management need to try travelling through their airport to experience the hell we passengers have to contend with. We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London, a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each - we thought we were lucky! (In retrospect, it seems other travellers have, perhaps, learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure - and they found alternative routes). Plodding the long route to ‘Immigration’ brought us to a large hall where we were confronted with, probably, 20 modern, state-of-the-art, passport-reading, data-collection machines. It is apparent from 95% of all the passengers being directed to the snake-queue (with a cross on the machines’ print-outs) illustrate that these state-of-the-art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot! I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue (line) for immigration and only two of the immigration desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient, utterly farcical process, to rush on to Baggage Reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped, little in the way of a clue which group of off-loaded bags might contain ours. 10 more minutes wasted. With just less than an hour left we rushed off to check-in our bags. Scanning the labels affixed in London we were then told that our flight to Pensacola (21:30) was ‘delayed’ until the next morning. (This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware: the flight was cancelled, cynically categorise as ‘delayed’, without any regard for the inconvenience to us, United Airlines customers, or for those who were travelling to meet us.) As with others’ reviews, finding a member of staff to provide any help, reassurance or information was nigh on impossible as we passed through to this point. The staff directing us just were’t interested in our concerns at the speed of the queue/processing: indeed they said that we should complain to the immigration officer - see how we got on! We did: it’s all because of the reallocation of staff to the Mexican border, we were told. Seems to me that the technology employed to replace the immigration officers is unfit for purpose, the immigration management team are not fit for purpose. Please don’t think that this inconvenient, inconsiderate, inept system is only foisted on aliens (from outside the US) there were US citizens with us in this queue as a result of the ineffective, technologically defective equipment. In conclusion, reviews on this website of the Houston Airport’s customers seem to indicate that our flight was only 30% populated because those in the know have found another airline/hub airport to use in preference to this shambolic shower. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes, we spent a further 40 minutes being processed - we were provided accommodation at the local Holiday Inn and food vouchers - and a flight ticket to continue our journey the next morning. Interestingly, our onward flight was completely full - accommodating passengers who’s earlier flight had been cancelled. After this trip, we will not fly by United Airlines to George Bush Airport again. George Bush Airport management need to recognise and address these problems before they lose their rest of their passengers to others.",-1

We had 1h25 minutes for our connecting flight to Frankfurt, but after 4! security checks we had to run to make it to our flight, if we were 1 minute later we would have missed our plane. Why isn’t there a separate queue for connections? We had a digital and manual passport control, a security dog check and when we thought that was it, we had to go through the scanner again! Already twice at our departure airport. We weren’t even entering the USA, but still had to go through this? I understand that security is important these days, but this was really ridiculous.

The customs line was an hour and 45 minutes, then security was another 18 minutes and of course, after all that, we missed our plane and had to deal with totally unconcerned Spirit agents, but that's for another review. TSA agents here are surly and unhelpful if asked a question, when we were rushing to our (already departed) plane after waiting what felt like an interminable time in customs, my daughter asked an agent a question about the location of a terminal, and, I kid you not, we had to wait a few seconds so he could finish softly singing his song before he reluctantly turned his inept attention to us. The tram was so slow it felt like a children's train Cedar Point. Avoid this airport if you can.",-1
2019-04-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,did not help us whatsoever,True,"  We were on our way home to UK from Cancun via Houston . Our flight was delayed by United Airlines due to storm in Houston. Fare enough. Instead of 3.5 hours we had about 1,5 hours, landing about 2 pm local time at HIA. We had 1 hour and a half to catch our flight to London scheduled for 16:25. Going through the whole process of passport checks, security checks and customs we realized that we have very limited time and started to worry. As we approached the last hurdle the baggage check we were told to go to a certain queue obviously for other people like us catching other flights. My friend was also doing it on the next line. I noticed they searched his bottles of Tequila that we both bought in Cancun. They were properly sealed and put back in the boxes and we were assured that this is ok to travell via Houston. I went to ask what is going on and asked kindly what is going on and that we are running late for our flight. One of the girls working as security replied to me -What is it got to do with me! At that point i thought that this was appalling to get answer like this but as we had very little time to get to the gate i decided not to get involved anymore. I few minutes later to my horror i realized that i have forgotten the bag with my two bottles. Immediately returned back and asked for it. An officer has given them back to me but they started checking them one by one the slowest possible way. In the meantime they confiscated on of the bottles from my mate although they wanted to take the other one as well. While i was waiting nervously for it to happen rep of United airlines looked at the screen and said my flight was now gone and i have no chance of getting on the plane. I desperately tried to call my wife who was at the gate but could not get through. Eventually a got my bottles and looked at the screen hoping for delay but there was nothing to confirm it. I had to run to gate E5 with my 13 old son and when we got finally there, there was a huge queue and people were still getting on board. Obviously the flight was delayed but nobody advised us on that and it was not shown on the screens. I cannot believe how unhelpful and rude were some of the people from security department and United Airlines. They kept repeating we are going to miss the flight and did not help us whatsoever. It was the opposite. They were rude and sarcastic.",-1

2019-03-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,Rest areas are non existent!,False,"  
I have been to nearly 40 to 50 airports and have to say that Houston airport is the worst one I’ve been to in my life. First of all, the connecting international flight after a 15 hour flight from Australia was scheduled only 90 minutes apart. Which means we only had 90 minutes to 1) Go through customs. 2) Go through TSA screening. 3) Retrieve all of our checked in luggage and take it on a 20 minute walk across the airport and send it through the scanner. 4) Go through security Again with our carry ons. 5) And finally get to our gate which was another 20 minutes away. We had 2 little kids with us and every time we asked the security staff to let us cut the lines because we will miss our connecting flight. The answer was the same: we will make sure we get you to your gate on time. Well. Guess what happened? We missed our flight. We were stuck at this horrible airport for an additional 6 hours because appearently United Airlines closed their gates 10 minutes prior to departure even though they’re missing passengers and the security staff kept telling us to not pay any attention to the boarding time but the departure time is what we should aim for. Completely dumb and uninformed. At this point the gave us the boarding passes for our next flight which was on the other side of the airport. And we had to walk to the customer service to get those boarding passes which was at the other end of the terminal we were at. The worst thing was that the gate was changed one hour prior to boarding to a completely different terminal. We had to walk for another 25 minutes carrying our kids who at this point had not had any sleep in 30 hours and every time we asked an employee with a cart (people mover) to help take us to the gate, they kept coming up with some excuse to not take us by what seemed out of complete lazyness. I found 2 carts parked and attempted to drive one myself but it had a pad with a code on it to start it. So. Back to the walking we went. Rest areas are non existent. Terminal seating is horrible and you can’t find any family oriented restaurants in terminal C, D or E. It’s all a bunch of bars and snack shops.",-1

The terminal is clean, well lit, and modern. You start to realize why you should avoid this airport at all costs if you travel through customs. Got global entry? They didn’t staff the kiosks, back of the line. Got mobile passport? That line feeds in to the regular line overflowing with people. Once you get past the customs line do you realize you have to then wait in the three times as long TSA line. Got pre? They don’t have a preline. I gave myself a three hour connection in Houston and still missed my connecting flight. What a disaster.",-1

I have decided to stop using United because they route me through Houston. The last two years I have traveled through Houston to a destination in Mexico. Both times it has been a nightmare. Departing wasn't so bad, except that I couldn't find a functioning water fountain even though I walked up and down two concourses looking for one. When I asked I was sent to one that was out of order. It is returning from Mexico that is horrendous. Even though we have Global Entry and TSA Pre, we invariably are sent on a wild goose chase (the employees don't seem to know that TSA Pre in Houston is closed and they always sent us to a different building so we can go through TSA Pre). We end up running like mad, trying to grab a sandwich and still making it to the gate in time to board. I suspect the TSA worker at Houston are some of the unhappiest. I would be too, working in such a poorly managed environment.",-1

People stopping in their tracks and looking around for some sort of instructions to get to their gate. There also should be an advisory informing walking time as opposed to taking transportation. Signage to subway is poor, never saw any. Very few workers to ask. If possible, I'll avoid IAH like the plague.",-1

Despite it being the early morning shift, in which you encounter groggy and stiff personalities, I wanted to say that they were very friendly and polite. They greeted me with a smile and kept the line going smoothly. Also to note, my husband was wearing his San Francisco government badge and they let him pass through without being scanned. Because they did that though, he accidentally left his garment bag in the conveyor belt. Luckily I heard them announce it on the intercom.

Tables with iPads and charging stations everywhere. Chairs bolt to the ground. What normal seat that is available is limited to one row per cate. The club music from the bar floods the terminal. One review says this terminal is “Sexy”. Yes that may be a good thing for a night out clubbing but not waiting for an international flight. Thankfully I didn’t have a delay or long layover.,-1

This airport is entirely too big to function effectively. The gates are to far apart, so do some inquires before hand to see which gate you land at and which one you will depart. As for me, I was asked to go to gate C from gate A. Quite a journey due to my heart surgery. There was absolutely no one to help me go from gate to gate, even though they had numerous empty golf type carts. An IAH employee called 3 separate times for a pick up for me but no one ever showed up. This airport is more concerned with the shops/restaurants than with passenger safety. I am a true Texan at heart but this airport needs functionality instead of being a big broken Texas mess. I will not be traveling through this airport ever again.

2018-07-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,only one TSA agent verifying tickets,False,"  I have never had issues with this airport. I have flown in and out of Bush for years now. I had a flight that departed IAH at 5.15am on Saturday morning. I arrived at the airport early, as I always do, just in case something unexpected happens. I guess I should've given myself four hours because the line to get into security was around 200 people deep with only one TSA agent verifying tickets and identifications. I waited in that line forever. Then, my flight was scheduled to leave in 10 minutes. I knew I wasn't going to make it because there wasn't enough staff to accommodate the growing number of passengers entering the security line. There was another TSA agent, but he was just sitting there helping the small line of TSA-Pre Check. When there wasn't anyone in the Pre-Check line, he just sat there in his chair and didn't even bother helping the growing line. Once I got up to the TSA agent, she met me with anger. She was rude and didn't even communicate to me with words! She just motioned me to move to the side without any explanation. I had to wait another 10 minutes, and by that time, my flight had already left the gate. I am very dissatisfied with my experience. Why was there only one TSA agent? I'd probably be rude to customers too if I was the only one working that terminal with a line of 200 people and growing. If you're going to the airport, just remember to be there maybe about six hours before your flight, because you never know how short staffed they will be on any given day.",-1

2018-04-20,0.3,Business,1,4,,4.0,,,,1.0,lack of organisation,False,  The installation of new security check machinery has been let down by a complete lack of organisation of the personnel. I witnessed three individuals wait in excess of 15 minutes for an opt out search due to no communication. Bags that were pulled required a 25 minute wait until a team member could perform a search due to an absence of “appropriate” staff. A request to expedite the process (I nearly missed my flight) was met with aggression as opposed to an explanation. Fair to say that the investment of personnel has not been matched with employee training.,-1

I was returning from a vacation in Mexico with my teenage daughters and almost missed my flight due to the slowest TSA operation I have ever encountered. Customs was efficient and a simple process but not security to get on my connecting flight to VA. I figured it being spring break would add to congestion but when other passengers are panicked about missing flights because lines aren’t moving then it is truly Houston we have a problem. My sister traveled on a different fight and missed her connection due to the hold up. Agents were predictably rude, unhelpful, and uncommunicative. I actually had an agent push her finger into my stomach and asked why I still had a belt on and told me to lift my shirt up high. Guess what, no belt, just a muffin top. The airport looks nice as we raced around trying to get to our gate-would have enjoyed being able to eat at one of the restaurants.",-1

I had 1.5 hours between flights and thought this would be enough, but no. There appeared to be only 3 desks open and 2 large aircraft landed at the same time, so the queues were very long and no staff around to speak to. When I finally arrived at the kiosk, the lady asked me why I didn't tell someone that I had a flight to catch! IAH need to employ more people! It is a ridiculous system in the US where you actually have to collect your bag then check it in AGAIN for onward travel. This is the only country where you have to do this. Every other country you can check your bag all the way through to your final destination. For a first impression of the US, IAH has sorely disappointed and unfortunately this is the airport I have to travel through every time as I now live in Houston.",-1

2017-06-30,0.9,Family Leisure,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,very cool and hip experience,False," A few months ago I've heard of a brand-spanking new high-tech Terminal C North was constructed at Houston and I was very pleased that my flight was there. This was the terminal of the future. The design was very modern and clean. Blue LED mood lighting filled up the whole terminal much like the one in the 787 Dreamliner. The terminal is huge with very high ceilings. The restrooms were like I was in a five-star hotel - very modern and clean and big. There was a nice selection of food and beverages to choose from. The restaurants were not your typical Mcdonalds (no McDonalds at IAH anymore though) or Subway restaurants rather they were the specialty, high-quality local restaurants that made it all the more special. There was also a decent amount of shops to choose from though I felt there too many selling the same things: souveniers, neck pillows, and magazines. What really got the kick out of my Terminal C North experience was the seating. They were not your typical airport seats rather they were leather and very cushioned armchairs and in front of you a table with charging ports and an iPad. Yes, an iPad in every seat! You can do countless things with the tablet to get you occupied such as games, access to the Internet browser, shopping, magazines and you can order food and drinks from it! Very cool and hip experience at Terminal C North and I can't wait to be there again!",1

2017-04-24,0.4,Solo Leisure,4,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,nothing to do but wait,False,  Layover to and from a family vacation in Roatan. On arrival was 15 mins too late for shuttle trains between terminals. I had several hours between flights so I walked between Terminal A and E only to discover security and United counter were long-past closed so I couldn't check bag or get to more secure part of the Airport. On my return flight I arrived earlier in evening. Was told I couldn't check my bag until it was within 12 hours of my flight. Went back at the appointed time - original info was incorrect and again I'm outside the secure area - only another 6.5 hours to go. Nothing to do but wait - not paying $300 for a room. I have books and puzzles but even Starbucks is now closed. Place is bright and clean enough but there is not even anywhere to plug in my phone.,-1
2017-04-16,0.8,Family Leisure,4,5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,very pleasantly surprised,False," Before transitting via Houston from an international airline to United Airlines I read the reviews on this site. The reviews had me very concerned about that 2 hours we had for transit from Terminal D (internationl) to B (domestic). My husband also required a wheelchair and this only added to my concerns and yet, we were very pleasantly surprised by the help and friendliness of the American staff. We received help from the airport staff who assist passengers with needs such as with the wheelchair (but you must book the wheelchair or other assistance with your airline). We did not experience the long queues at customs and they were not rude. Note. We landed and departed at off peak times - ie midday and 8pm. The airport is very modern but there is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) distance from Terminal A to Terminal D.and so you definitely need to take the upstairs Skytrain between terminals. There are some curvy corridors when navigating from arrival lounges, shops and the Skytrain but there are plenty of signs that point the way towards the Skytrain and other terminals. Note. For international to domestic transits you really need to allow 3 hours in case of queues and flight delays but it can be done within 2 hours if you are organised and only have carry on luggage and study the online airport maps to get an idea of where the Skytrain is located. Plus, the local USA airlines tend to stop passengers on to the domestic flights if is within 30 minutes of the plane leaving.",1
2017-03-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,5,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,Customs was the worst,False,  Customs was the worst we have ever dealt with. The waiting lines were more than 2.5  hours long. The staff was rude and kept moving us from line to line only to get put back in another line. There were dozens of people around me that missed their flights for the lack of help with customs. Out of all the times and places I have traveled I have never felt so frustrated. No one was helpful and they were certainly were not in a hurry. This airport has been the worst one of my life!,-1
2017-02-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,an airport to best be avoided,False,"  
An airport to best be avoided. If you do use it for transit, be sure to talk with the crew of the incoming flight. They may be able to help speed things up. Otherwise it seems you need to allow at least three hours transit time. There is no transit area, so you must clear immigration. There is an automated system, but it rejects most people and you go into another queue for manual processing. When I was there, there were 3 immigration counters operating. It took about two hours with no possibility of sitting, eating, or going to the toilet. Staff were uncommunicative and only sometimes apologetic. Once out of immigration you must collect your bags and find where to drop them again. It seems easier if you are travelling United or Star Alliance. It's a longish walk to the departure part of Terminal D. After leaving your bags, you must go through security to get to the departure gate. It is extremely thorough. Because I missed my connection and was coming next day the line was short. There are no signs about the rules, but they include: Remove everything from pockets, remove laptop from bag, empty water bottle, remove shoes and belt. You get scanned in a machine, wiped with explosive test, then patted down. I forgot to empty my water bottle. If I wanted to keep the bottle, the only choice was to exit and repeat the whole process. Did so as I had time and no queue. Everything was repeated including patting down. In the gate area there is good fast free wifi. Lesson: travelling from NZ to Europe, go via Asia.",-1

I fly internationally every month and will assiduously avoid IAH when coming in from Latin American cities. DFW is a much better alternative - international transfer security Pre-Check availability and TSA agents that don't treat you like garbage. IAH is also a dirty airport in general. You can tell when an organization has pride. At IAH, you can smell indifference the minute you get off the plane.",-1

The employees were continually yelling at us as if we were incompetent. They were not helpful to anyone. Instead they made snotty remarks and gave so much attitude to passengers. I can usually tolerate rudeness but it was all I could do to not say something back. I'm sure their job isn't easy or fun but they could at least have some humanity.,-1

I travel all the time and I have never met ruder people in my life, they seem extremely unhappy working there. They are yelling at people like we were going through military training. We were traveling on our honeymoon, coming from London, through Houston to Costa Rica. It was such a bad system, we had to go through customs, wait in line forever, why? I have no idea when we were in transit just trying to get to Costa Rica with no intention of staying in Houston. On the top of this, they had two hours to transfer our luggage and they failed to do so. They lost them! I will avoid this badly organized airport in the future for sure. I suggest you travel through different airports to avoid unnecessary stress.",-1

Once again the arrivals hall and immigration was full of hundreds of people. About 5 lines were open. It took over an hour to get to the immigration official. Then we were in another long line, about 40 minutes waiting for security screening to re-enter the terminal and go to our gate. We were lucky with a long layover and bags checked through but poor folks with tight connections and baggage that had to go through customs were really hooped. People using this airport for international travel need to be aware that one hour connecting time doesn't even come close to what is needed.",-1

I am Vegan as are many of your visitors. Nothing at your airport is Vegan nor Vegan-friendly. Please note that even small airports and international ones like Cancun have Vegan-friendly options at their restaurants. Do know that the entire world is not ""grits and gravy; ribs and chitlins; as is assumed in your airport. A salad of lettuce-only is not sufficient. How about some other options! Even chain restaurants offer Vegan-friendly. Do better; be inclusive.",-1
