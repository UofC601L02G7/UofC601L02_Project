2024-06-23,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,TSA in this airport is incredibly rude,False,"   The TSA in this airport is incredibly rude. I came in with a fractured ankle, and nobody was helping me. They were screaming at me. I managed to take a picture of that rude person, who wouldn't even tell me his name and covered his tag so I wouldn't catch his name. Embarrassing. I hope he and the other rude people around gets fired. This is terrible. No one deserves to be treated like that!! Thank you Shanon and Cameron for be the only kind and professional people at this airport.",-1
2024-03-30,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,TSA yelled at and berated my daughter,True,  The airport itself is nice and clean but the staff were awful! I consider myself pretty easy going and let a lot of things brush over but the way my daughter and I were treated was completely uncalled for. It was myself and my 5 year old learning disabled daughter traveling home from a vacation visiting family in North Carolina. TSA yelled at and berated my daughter for struggling to follow exact instructions scaring her and made following instructions that much harder. It turned our already stressful day into a nightmare. I understand millions of people move through the airport and there are protocols that need to be followed for everyone’s safety but I can say with absolute certainty we will never fly into or out of Raleigh again. Experiencing one moody/rude person is easy to pass off as they are having a bad day but literally everyone! Staff really need to get in touch with how to treat travelers like human beings not prisoners. Chicago O’Hare TSA/staff are top notch and were so kind for our trip flying out making our experience this morning that much more shocking.,-1
2023-08-02,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,TSA agents are rude and condescending,True," This airport is fine, but the TSA agents (terminal 1) are rude and condescending. I frequently fly with small children (my 12th flight with 2 two-year-olds) and have never had a worse experience with TSA practically berating me over stroller. Most airports have you breakdown the stroller and run through machine. NOT here. If you don’t want to be harassed, do not break your stroller down. I would suggest you refrain from asking either because they will make jokes about you in front of everyone. They are slow, unhelpful and unprofessional.",-1
2023-03-27,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,5.0,an exceptional airport,False,"  Being fed up with the chaos at many ports of entry into the USA from Europe (as a non USA-citizen), I thought to try out a new way to enter the USA with less wait, hassle, stress and frustration. I flew the non-stop AA flight from LHR into RDU. Even though I was in business class and was among the first to disembark, I believe all passengers entered the USA (border control), in 15 minutes or less. It took me 3 minutes from plane door to curbside.  Also, the airport is modern and clean, really nice staff. With just one or two daily incoming flights from Europe, I don't think there is a better way to travel into the USA from Europe. I connected the next morning on a very early (5 am) departure. Staff told me there was a 'morning rush', so I was a bit nervous about TSA opening only at 4 am. Arrived at 3:30 am, and soon after that TSA started processing passengers. Again, lovely kind people all around. What an exceptional airport!",1
2022-10-20,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the worst airport I have to use,True,"  I fly every week. RDU is always the worst airport I have to use. And this is saying something since I have to fly out of NYC airports. The security check point is horrible. Regardless of time of day - even 5.00 am. The line is so long it spills out into the baggage drop area. And it's ALWAYS this way. The staff are so rude. They obviously enjoy harassing people. Then, should you have enough time for food or coffee, the lines are huge for these too. Don't even think about Starbucks unless you get to the airport 3 hours before your flight.",-1
2022-07-02,0.1,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,I am extremely dissatisfied,True,  I had a Frontier flight that was scheduled to depart at 9.46pm and found out it was delayed. Upon hearing that I was ok and figured I could just enjoy some of the restaurants and found out that every bar and restaurant closes at 8pm. I was told by an employee that when flights are delayed they are supposed to receive a memorandum that will keep the restaurants open until those flights have departed. There are too many people that pay good money to fly and there are no accommodations to keep them comfortable and entertained until their departure. I strongly recommend the hours change from 8 to 10pm for closing time. I understand these places open up at 4.30 or 5am but you still have fliers who take flights late in the evening. These little stores that stay open does not meet the demands of customers. I am extremely dissatisfied.,-1
2022-03-20,0.8,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,extremely clean and efficient,True," I have flown to/from RDU 4-5 times now at different times and hours during 2020-22. I must say that it is one of the best run mid-tier airports in the country. Beautiful and thoughtful design, airy and welcoming, extremely clean and efficient. The security wait times have always been under 10 mins. Decent food and shopping options too. It's hard to fault this one, just needs to step up when it comes to wifi and entertainment options. Otherwise, it's a great airport.",1
2021-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot,False,"  The Terminal 2/AA/Delta etc arrival area, where most airlines come in, is the most poorly run pick up area I have ever been to. Twice this summer I had to experience the gridlock of cars attempting to pick up people at this terminal. There is no way to pull over to pick up people, even when they are right there waiting out front. The security officers yell at you to keep driving around, adding to traffic issues and do not give you a chance to pull over. My 80-year-old mother was stepping across several lanes of traffic to try and reach me and the security officer was yelling at both of us. I had already circled around 3 times! The poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot. If they would let you pick up passengers, there would be fewer problems. They should redirect rental car buses to another location or spread arrivals out so there are fewer people trying to be picked up at the same time. The security officers should get off of their Segways and try being helpful instead of yelling at elderly people and those picking them up.",-1
2021-05-18,0.1,Business,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,no free internet available,True,  Remarkable that they speak several languages over the loud speaker but have no free internet available. A disgrace to the travel industry. I will rethink coming through RDU ever again.,-1
2021-01-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,give yourself far more time than you think you’ll need,False,"  The airport staff, especially American, appears to be inept. You’d think in a small regional airport that you’d get through it more quickly than a major international one. If you thought that like me, you’re gravely mistaken. RDU is the worst-functioning, most difficult-to-manage airport I have been to! Be prepared to wait, and give yourself far more time than you think you’ll need.",-1
2019-11-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,a negative experience,False,"  TSA employees in Terminal 1 were rude and totally unnecessarily aggressive in screening/searching people. Worst I've seen. We were surprised as we never had such treatment in Terminal 2 which we normally use. Found Terminal 1 to be like a bus station. Insufficient restaurants, limited seating. Overall a negative experience.",-1
2019-09-27,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,TSA agents couldn’t have been more unprofessional,False,"  I was traveling from RDU back home to Pittsburgh with my son and daughter. We had an 8.15 am flight so we arrived at RDU by 6.30 am to give us plenty of time check our luggage and pass through security. The TSA agents couldn’t have been more unprofessional and down right rude. There was no explanation of what to do they just started yelling at my son and daughter to walk in a line and telling them they were “moving to slow” and “walk at a normal pace”. My son has ADD so when no instruction is given I’m not sure how he would no what to do, especially being 9 years old and never flying before.",-1
2019-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,"My wife, son and I missed our flight",False,"  The TSA need to either hire more employees or find a faster way to get people through to their flights. My wife, son and I missed our flight because of the TSA line being wrapped all the way around the building. We would have made it had they done a better job moving people through with flight times leaving soon!",-1
2019-07-20,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4.0,,hour wait for security,False," Leaving Raleigh-Durham airport in the morning is a nightmare! I have never seen anything like this. An hour wait for security alone. The situation is a disgrace to the Triangle area. If Atlanta, Chicago and other massive airports can accommodate a morning crowd without a wait like this, RDU should be able to. Get your act together!",-1
2019-04-13,0.5,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,5.0,3.0,TSA person scolded me,False,"  TSA person, I felt scolded me for wearing the type of personal undergarments I was wearing. She very harshly pointed to areas that had to be verified safe. As a fuller upper body, I am accustomed to being patted down due to being of ample upper body and whatever but this time, the TSA person, in my opinion went to far. I told her I had on spandx and she said “that’s just not spanx, you have something else”. I was absolutely flabbergasted. So, after being patted down to a degree of humiliation, she said” you can go.” There were all male TSA and male employees around. I know all this is for security. It’s not pleasant but I do understand. However, some things are just common sense. All other agents that day were professional and kind. Where as I would have rated this experience a 10, the TSA episode bumped the rating to 5.",1
2017-12-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,had a terrible experience,False,  I had a terrible experience at the Raleigh airport TSA check in. The check-in people were extremely rude. I am pregnant traveling alone carrying my luggage and they made me go back to the end of the line for a small amount of water in my water bottle. The supervisor and check in staff were extremely rude and harsh. I ultimately had to throw away my water bottle since I was pressed for time.,-1
2017-09-02,0.5,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,,5.0,0.0,,,,wait an hour for a gate,False, I am normally quite happy with Raleigh-Durham but we just arrived back from vacation this evening and the airport made us wait for an hour until a plane could leave our predetermined gate. I have been at other airports that will just reassign the plane to another gate so that passengers can continue on with their journeys without the inconvenience of the delay. I found this extremely disappointing since I expected RDU to have a better customer satisfaction operation. I blame airport operations for this blunder and feel this could be addressed as an improvement opportunity.,1
2017-07-24,1.0,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,4.0,4.0,"open, clean, and inviting",False,"  First time going to this airport since 2007 and since then it has completely renovated and added two new terminals to replace the old ones. Terminal 1, dominated by Southwest, is open, clean, and inviting. There were no lines at security, and I went through the TSA line within five minutes. The terminal was easy to navigate, with plenty of open space and updated arrival and departure screens for the various flights. Upon returning home, it was easy to find baggage claim and wait for my ride.",1

2016-10-10,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,a horrible experience,False," Took JetBlue Flight #985 on Oct 9,2016 from NYC to Raleigh-Durham. When we arrived in RDU, the gate was closed and passengers had to yell to be let out. I parked my car in parking lot 3 so needed to take airport bus. The bus was leaving as I got to the bus stop and I waved the lady to open the door for me and she refused. It was 2:30 AM. There was nobody else on the bus. Had to take taxi, so ended up paying more then parking at the premium parking. What a horrible experience.",-1
