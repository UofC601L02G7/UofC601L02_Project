TSA usually gets a bad rap, but I'm here to tell you they were awesome today. I was taken to the side where an alternate route of id verification was sought. I was treated promptly and with the utmost in professionalism. Thanks TSA - I made my flight.",1
2024-07-15,0.9,Business,5,5,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,terminal 3 is really excellent,True,  Phoenix is the easiest of all major US airport to get in and out of. I picked Phoenix as my home based in part because I needed a reliable airport considering how often I fly and PHX does not disappoint. The new terminal 3 is really excellent and the improved lounge situation at Terminal 4 is really appreciated.,1
2024-03-12,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“Easily the worst airport”,False," Easily the worst airport I have ever traveled through. To transfer from one US flight to another flight wholly in the US you have to reclear TSA. They don't have free wifi, Anchorage Alaska can manage free wifi WTF Phoenix. The airport is so spread out and disconnected forget getting something from another terminal.",-1
2024-01-08,0.3,Couple Leisure,5,5,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"fails to live up to its false moniker"" ",True,"  ""America's Friendliest Airport"" is false advertisement. Phoenix Sky Harbor is anything but and fails to live up to its false moniker. From baggage claim, it is impossible to find the Rental Car Center on your own because the signage for such could not be found. At 10:30 PM, I could find no airport personnel to help and an airline employee whom I was able to find seemed genuinely annoyed and displeased that I was asking him for assistance. Upon my return, the rental car return was extremely confusing and nobody from the rental car agency could be found to assist me. I just dropped my car and prayed that I had left it in the right spot and wouldn't incur any additional charges. Once I arrived at my terminal from the Sky Train, signage initially directed me to ticketing and check-in, but then the signage abruptly stopped when I reached the escalators and a four-way intersection. I looked all over and there was no more signage to tell me where to go. Another passenger saw my confusion and directed me where to go. Once I received directions, I looked for additional signage in the direction I was sent, and could find none.",-1
2023-08-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I will never forget her,True,"  I truly believe that the woman at Passport Control saved my life on Thursday, July 20, 2023. After being the last to disembark from a British Airways flight from London, I mustered up what little strength I had as I approached Passport Control. The woman at the entrance to Passport Control took one look at me and said, ""You are having a medical emergency. Come with me to the wheelchair line."" She whisked me to the front of that line and waited for the EMT staff to wait on me. I was taken to the Banner Medical Center via ambulance where we discovered I had an acute case of Pulmonary Embolism. I was going to try to push through my final flight to Tucson and get tomy home city. Had she not recognized the acute state of emergency I was in and taken me to get care, I may well have died. I will never forget her.",1
2023-04-21,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,One of the worst airports,False,"  One of the worst airports I’ve been to. Surly employees, no bars only cheap food in overpriced chain style beer pubs or family grab and go’s. And not one place to get a drink in Terminal 3.",-1
2023-03-03,0.1,Business,1,1,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,Half the restaurants were closed,True,"  Terminal 3 restroom across from gate 6 was filthy and there wasn’t any paper towels to dry your hands. Half the restaurants were closed, not enough choices although it was only 6:30pm.",1
2023-02-28,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,3.0,40 minutes for wheelchair assistance,True,  Phoenix Sky Harbor is not set up up to accommodate people with injuries or disabilities. I flew in and out of there in January and February with an injury and had bad experiences. In January I had to walk long ways to get from rental car return to Sky Train and then waited 40 minutes for wheelchair assistance. In February walked long distances again. There needs to be assistance provided from rental cars to airline ticket desk.,-1
2023-01-15,0.8,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,like consideration for announcements in English and Spanish,False,  Very good service but would like consideration for announcements in both English and Spanish. We are proud Arizonans for over 20 years having retired from the Army in southern Arizona.,1
2023-01-12,0.1,Business,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,the worst TSA experience,True,"  The TSA agents were the rudest I have ever encountered. I'm not sure if the TSA here trains their agents to intimidate passengers - like drill instructors in the military - but I met a few today that seem to have forgotten they are interacting with people just trying to get on an airplane to get home to their family. Very scary, unnerving experience and I will go out of my way to avoid this airport in the future. (Otherwise, service inside was lovely, great restaurant selection, super friendly people, clean and pretty airport. But the worst TSA experience of my life)",-1
2022-12-07,0.1,Business,4,1,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,the floors were filthy dirty,False,"  Next to TSA pre the floors were filthy dirty, dust, hair, black stains on the floor. TSA had me take off my shoes and didn’t have socks so I had to step on that filthy floor bare foot.",-1
2022-11-28,0.8,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,restrooms are not clean enough,True," Why there is no a nap/chapel/compassion room in terminal 3? There should be also a multi faith room, why there is no one? Also family restrooms are not clean enough.",1
2022-10-29,0.9,Business,5,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4.0,an extremely pleasant experience,True,"  Based in Phoenix, I often have to travel through both Terminals and it is an extremely pleasant experience, specifically when compared to many other airports in the US and abroad, It can get a little crowded specifically in winter but with Clear and TSA Pre I never spent more than 5 min waiting for Security. Facilities are clean, including brand new Terminal 3 and there are amazing food options. There is nothing I can complain about outside of the lack of International flight options with only 1 daily destination to Europe and None to Asia … a shame for an airport serving more than 40 million passengers per year!",1
2022-10-25,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,4,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I am truly sorry I bothered you,False,"  Of the 5 service employees we encountered, only one was cordial and she was on her break. All the others were short and talked down as if they didn't want to be bothered. Bought food and asked for some napkins and was given only one for the two of us. I am truly sorry I bothered you.",-1
2022-07-16,0.3,Family Leisure,4,1,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,It is absolutely filthy,False,  I fly out and into this terminal many times throughout the year visiting family. It would be nice if the terminal was kept clean in terms of the floor and the garbage. It is absolutely filthy tonight,-1
2022-06-29,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,,What is going on in Phoenix?,False,"  The most crowded, chaotic, and hectic airport I've ever been to. Poor foot traffic flow, not nearly enough seating, rude vendor employees. What is going on in Phoenix?",-1
2022-06-18,0.5,Family Leisure,3,3,,5.0,0.0,,,3.0,It was violent and just a horrible experience,False,"  I was picking my son up on June 8th flew him out to help him recover from surgery. The flight attendants were great, just wonderful at helping him in his wheelchair but as we (my daughter was driving) pulled up to terminal 4 a male employee directing traffic began screaming at me to keep moving. I brought my daughter to do just that while I went in and wheeled him out. I was sincerely just trying to ask him a question and he refused to look at me or acknowledge me just kept screaming. It was violent and just a horrible experience. I really just had to share that with someone. What an obscene way for this airport to do business.",-1
2022-05-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the airport was filthy,False,"  Most unfriendly airport ever! TSA were rude and spoke very condescendingly, like we were animals being herded! All the food vendors were rude and never said thank you, acted like we owed them. Inside the airport was filthy! Looked like the maintenance and janitorial crew went on strike! Ticket counters for Alaska Airlines were very friendly. I saw signs in the airport saying it was a friendly airport. It's a lie!",-1
2022-04-30,0.1,Family Leisure,2,2,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,never had a worse airport experience,True,  I have never had a worse airport experience. Never have I been treated so rude by airport employees and I fly monthly with my toddler. From TSA agents to the delta desk agent the were extremely inconsiderate and unhelpful to my small family. Usually the airport is a breeze for us but I will definitely avoid flying out of this airport in the future. And to top it all off there was someone openly watching porn and commenting on in in the terminal in front of children. I was mortified.,-1
2022-04-25,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,not nearly enough seating,True,  Bathrooms are filthy. There's not nearly enough seating for passengers and corridors are lined with people sitting on the floor. 1/2 of the restaurants are closed for no reason at all. And get this- you can't go to a restaurant bar before standing in a wait line. Everything is done wrong. Whoever is managing this airport needs to be replaced.,-1
2022-03-27,0.1,Business,4,1,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,this was just too much,False,"  Flew out of Phoenix terminal 3 3/27/22. The bathrooms were horribly dirty. No toilet paper in over half the stalls in the women's concourse E bathrooms. There was debris all over the floors, and the trash was overflowing. It was disgusting. I fly almost weekly and let a lot go but this was just too much.",1
2022-03-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,4,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,I feel service can be improved,False,"  So first time in a while that I've been to this airport. I got a little turned around and looked everywhere for someone to help, unfortunately everyone ignored me. Finally I went up to a desk and asked the lady attending the Hawaii desk and asked my question. She treated me rather rudely and cold. Don't usually leave reviews unless I feel service can be improved and I think it should be. Also have an anonymous tip line, it makes it easier.",-1
2022-01-17,0.2,Business,4,3,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,My experience was frustrating,True,"  I was dismayed to see that a few years ago, this airport received high ratings. My experience was frustrating. I went through Phoenix in transit. Flights were on time in my case. However I had a hankering for a smoothie since I ate some food brought onto the airplane. Since I had lots of time, I went to every set of gates. You can't even buy a smoothie in this airport. Panera Bread had some on the menu but were all sold out. Every flavor. No wonder! Many restaurants were not even open. I travel a lot, and this airport is now near the bottom.  Covid is no excuse because I have traveled much during the pandemic. A few other things.  The charging stations are all on little block tables that are always very crowded. Some of the outlets are so worn out that your adapter falls out or you have to shake it to connect. But usually you can find one that will work There are no outlets in lounge seats at all. Some signs do not show gates in both directions. Went towards the C-Gates and had to look backwards to see that I had to turn left for C1 to C9. I surmised that because I have airport experience but woe to the person who does not. I know to have very low expectations when coming through here. Hopefully I will not have to use this airport for anything in the near future.",-1
2021-11-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,the worst international airport,True,"  Do not travel through Phoenix Sky Harbor. Long lines, over zealous security having every other bag extra checked, the airport is dirty, they have everyone crammed into a small area and no restaurants are open. Hundreds of international passengers arriving from 10+ hour flights to this pathetic excuse for an airport. Travel through anywhere else. This is the worst international airport I have ever experienced.",-1
2021-11-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,the worst traveling experience we’ve ever had,True," For the last 3 years, I know there’s a pandemic, Sky Harbor has been the worst traveling experience we’ve ever had. Twice, we have reserved a rental car and showed up to no cars available. We make other arrangements now. The food and service options have taken a nose dive. The ‘we don’t care less feeling' is palpable from people working everywhere throughout food service options, which I might add is almost null. Maybe this is showing businesses that they need to pay people a living wage. We will be making other arrangements so we don’t have to eat in this pathetic excuse for an airport.",-1
2021-11-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,2.0,barely any restaurants open,False,"  There’s barely any restaurants open, half of gate A they are all closed and the other half of gate A is so packed you have to wait super long for a table which makes no sense. Opposite of covid safe and pretty ridiculous for people who have a long stressful day of traveling. Do better.",-1
2021-11-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,No restaurants open,True," If you have a red-eye flight or anything from 7pm onwards, you're absolutely screwed on food choices. No restaurants open, no staff to help, and extremely overpriced sandwich/chip options. Since it's silly to eat dinner at 6pm, we wanted to sit at the airport at a bar/restaurant like every other airport in the world, not Phoenix airport. After arriving at 8, everything was closed which is absurd and unheard of in the travel industry. After looking through every single gate for over an hour, we had to settle on a self-serve kiosk. Give a guess how much 2 sandwiches, 2 fruit juice, 1 bag of chips, and some pathetic soggy veggies was? If you guessed anything lower than $47, then you're wrong. Absolute abomination and the management needs to learn how to get a grasp with their pathetic excuse for an airport. Just quit your jobs now and give it to someone that will actually look after the customer. FYI, whilst eating our ""dinner"" there were many other travellers in the same boat desperately looking for food and stressing to find something for their flight. This wasn't just an issue that we experienced ourselves.",-1
2021-11-09,0.3,Business,1,2,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,don’t book a flight through Phoenix,False,"  Good evening peasants! Please don’t come to Phoenix Sky Harbor after about 8 pm and expect to be treated like a human. I mean, if you are hungry, don’t expect to have an open restaurant or bar. We may allow you to buy some food that is covered in plastic, but for sure no alcohol. You should have planned better. First, you should have booked your flight with a carrier that did not re-route and re-book you. Better yet, don’t book a flight through Phoenix. Even better yet, don’t be such a looser and charter a jet that takes you directly to your destination. Didn’t become a rock star or a movie star as a kid and you worked for a living? Bad planning. Served in the armed forces? Gosh, thanks so much for your service, no human food for you either. It’s just business, I’m sure. Stop whining, we left the lights on! The news stand is open, and they sell candy. How ungrateful. Well, that is what you get when you sell things to peasants. No gratitude.",-1
2021-11-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,nothing was open,True,  Had a red eye departing 1130pm straight shot to Newark - I got here at 830 to have dinner and a glass of wine in terminal 3 - nothing was open. How disappointing and sad to sit for 2½ hours with no hospitality or libation. Disgraceful,-1
2021-10-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,2,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,the place is full of closed restaurants and bars,True, Saturday afternoon and the place is full of closed restaurants and bars. We had several hours to wait and everything was closed.,-1
2021-10-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,,Avoid this airport at all costs,False,"  This airport is just gross. It is so crowded that you can barely walk. The trash cans are overflowing, there was water all over the bathroom floor, and trash all over the ground. Avoid this airport at all costs.  If you have a layover here and you are considering a different flight- go with the different flight.",-1
2021-09-13,0.1,Business,3,4,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,Wake up Sky Harbor,True," I travel with 3-4 large 70 lb tool boxes for my business. I had to search for a luggage cart as they have been removed. I found one in the corner of the departure lounge. Today when I arrived back to the airport, no luggage carts. I asked a Delta agent where the carts were and I was told the contract with the company that supplied them ended and the new company was supposed to be set up August 1, but has not yet done anything. How are you supposed to carry 4, 70 pound tool boxes to the parking garage. No skycaps, no luggage carts. Whoever runs the airport and makes these decisions without thinking of the inconvenience to passengers who I am sure have had to deal with the same issue is an idiot. I was told by one of the purple help personnel to use a wheelchair. Really. Wake up Sky Harbor. August 1st has come and gone more than 70 days ago.",1
2021-09-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,not even McDonald's is open,False,"  8:00 on a Saturday night and not even McDonald's is open let alone getting a lousy beer. Terrible, Starbucks closed, pizza joint closed - no pizza at 8 o'clock on Saturday night. I will definitely reconsider Phoenix airport next time I go thru here.",-1
2021-09-03,0.2,Business,3,3,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,most restaurants closed,False,"  Very limited in dining choices - most restaurants closed. Went to different terminals and only choices are Mexican food or sandwiches. Sat for 15 minutes in one restaurant and finally left since no one even came over. Bought a sandwich and then nowhere to sit and eat . Kept delaying my flight and since the seats are limited unless you want to sit right next to someone, I have been standing for hours while they continually delay the flight. Only outlets are on a counter which has been in use at all times.",-1
2021-08-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,stores and restaurants are closed at 7pm,False,"  It is a Friday night, plenty of flights coming in and going out, stores and restaurants are closed at 7pm. Absolutely ridiculous. Can't even get a cup of coffee. Just horrible.",-1
2021-08-23,0.2,Family Leisure,2,2,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,Dining options here are very poor,False,  Dining options here are very poor. Lines for what few options exist tend to be very long. I have been to this airport several times and it is always the same. Seating is very limited too. Renting a car is a hassle with the shuttle back and forth and adds another line to wait through before you can leave the airport.,-1
2021-08-14,0.1,Business,1,2,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,airport has the worst layout,True,  This airport has the worst layout. After getting off the plane there was long wait to get luggage. Once received there were No instructions as to how to find rental car company (Sixt) was mine. I had to board a bus to “rental car“ several miles away and even longer due to slow Bus. Once at the rental place there were more lines as everyone gets dumped at one spot. Return was worse as there are NO clear directions to return. once at the right place after car drop off another rotten bus ride to the airport. 2 hrs to return car and get to the airline. English is not the language there either.,-1
2021-08-13,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,The floor was dirty,False,"  Waited in concourse D. The floor was dirty. Looks like it hasn’t been vacuumed in who knows how long. There is trash under the seats and across the floor. There are not enough charging stations/plugs. People park it and refuse to move once they are charged up. Disorganized, I don’t know if it’s due to staffing or the airline (Southwest). Tired and I want to go home. Plus side, they do have a place to take your pet to the restroom.",-1
2021-08-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,"America's friendliest airport, indeed!",False,"  I arrived and departed in the early morning hours. It was busy but not overcrowded. No long lines and TSA was pleasant enough. Easy to find your way around. America's friendliest airport, indeed!",1
2021-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,2,2,,2.0,0.0,,,,there are zero luggage carts available,True," There are no luggage carts in Terminal 3 for people with special needs, seniors, people traveling with small children, and international travelers. This was confirmed at the information desk within Terminal 3 that there are zero luggage carts available. With Sky Harbor being an international airport within a large metropolitan city, this is truly disgraceful. My wife arrived last night from abroad with our 2 small children, 3 large suitcases, 3 carry on bags, and a large back pack. I recently had back surgery and could offer no assistance to my spouse with moving luggage due to lifting restrictions. After a 24 hour international trip and consoling our four year old daughter along the route by picking her up, she was already complaining of a sore back when they arrived. After all that, my wife had to make three separate trips lugging large suitcases clear across the airport to the parking garage while I helplessly watched our children. At no time did anyone at the airport volunteer to offer any help or assistance. This is fundamentally wrong, irresponsible, and shows complete lack of planning and foresight by airport management in every possible way. People traveling into and out of Sky Harbor will need to bring along additional hands and resources since the airport is unable to provide the very basic necessities or help all airports, regardless of size should possess.",-1
2021-06-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,the absolute worst airport I have ever encountered,True," This is the absolute worst airport I have ever encountered. The visit started with TSA when I proceeded to remove my laptop from my backpack due to the fact that I am an avid flyer and understood that was a standard precaution. I got my bag slammed in my face and was told to not touch anything. After this experience we arrived to the terminal at 3:00 expecting for restaurants to be open for dinner, this is a invalid thought as the restaurants decide when they can open and close. The google and/or Apple Maps isn’t even accurate to the time they will close. We arrived at the Panera two minutes after closing and they wouldn’t even serve us, resulting in forcing us to eat at a quick store for a $20 sandwich. Nothing within the airport is connected and the airport TSA/Staff laugh at you when you ask where you can get dinner.",-1
2021-06-08,0.1,Family Leisure,3,3,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,worst TSA staff I've ever encountered,False,"  Absolute worst TSA staff I've ever encountered! They were rude, unhelpful, & down right miserable. After we loaded our bags, shoes, etc onto the security belt we were told to wait in line at the metal detector. However there was nobody over there to assist us and the Closed sign was set up. Meanwhile all our items had gone through and were on the other side unattended. I asked if someone could please assist us so we could get to our luggage and I was told to wait and eventually someone would help us. We continued to wait for approximately 10 more minutes. Meanwhile listening to the TSA officer cuss under his breath. When we finally were let through we grabbed our luggage (which was fortunately all there) we started to leave to get out of the way and was yelled at by the female TSA officer to remove our bins off the belt. I will never come back to this airport!",-1
2021-05-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,2,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,"rudest, most miserable TSA agents",True,"  Travel all over the country often airports large and small. PHX by far has the worst, rudest, most miserable TSA agents we have ever encountered! Not just 2 us but everyone around us. I have never seen such behavior it was unreal! The icing on the cake is the rental car/airport shuttle system. Never experienced anything so slow and dysfunctional even at airports twice the size, it is a complete failure",-1
2021-04-13,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,The line for the rental car bus was incredible,False,  The line for the rental car bus was incredible. Waited 45 min in line for a bus. No urgency and no attempts to increase number of buses. I don’t understand and I am sure many people will miss their flights.,-1
2021-04-10,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,Was quite disappointed with the cleanliness,True," Was quite disappointed with the cleanliness and overall conditions of the gate that we were at. There was hand sanitizer, but none of them worked. The seats had crumbs and dirt all over them. Lastly, the bathrooms were dirty and only half of the containers had soap or towels in them. We had bottles on the floor around our gate. As for the gate, we couldn’t hear the flight attendant telling us about our flight because there was a TV show playing in the speakers above us, when we told them they said there was nothing they could do and just to come closer, there are over 70 people on this aircraft and you want all of us around the gate? So much for the 6 ft social distance rules I guess, but then again the airlines pack us in like sardines so what’s the point of the social distance rule anyways.",-1
2020-02-28,0.6,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,4.0,restaurant choices are limited and very noisy,False,  Once you go through security restaurant choices are limited and very noisy. If you have dietary limitations or are vegetarian there are not many offerings. Assistance with immigration was the bright spot. Ladies at Global Entry were excellent.,1
2020-02-23,0.7,Solo Leisure,4,4,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,Consistently frustrating,False,"  The return baggage system speed is the worst of any airport that I frequent and I fly a lot. Consistently frustrating, I dread having to check a bag.",1
2019-12-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,4,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,has the slowest baggage claim,False,  I fly a lot out of many airports and Sky Harbor has the slowest baggage claim I've ever experienced. It is the best reason I moved away from Phoenix. I always dread the return to visit family.,-1
2019-12-20,0.8,Solo Leisure,3,3,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,some of the nicest and friendliest people,False,  I think the TSA agents at Sky Harbor are some of the nicest and friendliest people I've experienced. The only thing I didn't like about the airport was the extra hour it took to get to the car rentals. All of the volunteers at the airport are super nice.,1
2019-11-14,0.2,Business,2,3,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,One of the worst designed airports,True," I’ve traveled all over the country and internationally. One of the worst designed airports and even without the design my service experience was terrible. Flight sat on the runway for 30 min. Bags took forever to come out. Had to wait in line for a bus to the car rental place. Car rental place was 15 minutes away. It’s a desert, are you telling me you couldn’t build one closer? How valuable is your sand? Signage was bad at the rental car place. Lines were bad because a bus load of people got there at the same time. Phoenix airport mentions that they will be getting a train connection to the car rental in a couple years. First of all, that means they know they suck even if they want to claim and trademark that they are the friendliest airport. It also doesn’t make the long drive to the rental any better. Instead of a bus now I’m gonna be on a tram. Great job Phoenix. The day service is determined within the first 20 minutes of the experience. Mine was spent on the runway and the remaining hour was spent getting my bags and car. Thanks. I hope my negative word of mouth affects your business like you affected mine. I’ll make sure to let every person I know. Enjoy your terrible NPS.",-1

2019-06-28,0.8,Family Leisure,3,4,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,fast and easy for domestic travel,False,"  Everyone is honestly being far too harsh. Phoenix Sky Harbor is really not bad, the lines are usually short, getting through security is pretty fast, tons of great stores and restaurants open. However, there is basically no international flights which really sucks but LAX is a 1 hour flight away so it’s not really that big of an issue. As for domestic flights, they have one to basically every large city and often. Bathrooms are clean, WiFi is fantastic, not a lot of gate seating though. Basically, it’s not bad at all, fast and easy for domestic travel.",1
2019-06-05,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,polite and helpful service,True,"  I encountered polite and helpful service by the employees at checkin and in the restaurants of the Phoenix International Airport. It is an easy airport to navigate. Overall the airport was very clean and I was particularly impressed with the restrooms. The ladies restrooms had plenty of paper towels and toilet tissue, the sinks were freshly cleaned, the mirrors were shiny without marks, the floors were clean and shiny, and each stall was quite large, which I really liked! I was quite impressed with this airport and will gladly recommend it to others.",1
2019-04-22,0.1,Business,2,2,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,not the friendliest airport,True," Definitely not the friendliest airport, lots of unfriendly treatment of passengers including: - having to walk, yes walk outside in the heat or cold between two of the terminals, no train, no buses like there used to be, I’ve never seen anything like it. They say there is a golf cart to help transport but I’ve only seen it once in twenty times and it was full. So you just have to walk with your luggage. Good luck. If you land past 9:30pm they close several of the exits in Terminal 4 so you have to walk twice as far just to get out of the terminal, then you have to walk back to baggage claim or your car. They make hundreds and hundreds of passengers walk late at night so they can close two exits and save on one security guard’s wages—not friendly, annoying after a long day of travel. There are 8 gates at the end of the B concourse that are squeezed into the space that one or two gates would be. It’s crazy, people pushing each other, literally lines crossing each other to get onto the plane and no seating, everyone has to stand or sit on the floor. Why crush 8 gates into such a small space? Not friendly. Creates angry passengers. Honestly I’m trying to find what is friendly about PHX.",-1
2019-04-17,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,No car rental shuttle buses,True," On arrival last week April 11, I took the earliest flight from DCA getting to Reagan airport at 4:30 AM to arrive at Phoenix at 9:20 AM. No car rental shuttle buses. The line was hundreds of passengers long. Inexcusable. Tonight on my return flight, fearing the car return bus fiasco, I arrived at the airport 5 hours before my flight. At check in the said Gate A 6 An hour later they switched to gate A 20 (another pier). An hour later the sent me back to A 11. Then after that 1.5 hours before departure they switched me to gate B 13. As I passed AA passenger assistance counter in The B Gate pier, one of the two AA employees pulled the ribbon closed in front of me and said “Closed!” At 9:45. I just wanted to ask her if they were going to change us again. She stepped out passed the ribbon she closed and pointed 100 feet back up the B gate pier for me to go look at the overhead flight boards. Never an apology. And for this so am paying for First Class. A decent company would offer a refund. The airport food service facilities are wholly inadequate with passengers waiting in long lines to be seated. (Half hour wait at an airport)",-1

I got to Terminal 4 at 6am on Monday and I see a sign to Terminal 4 South car park. No other information was given. Was it short term I wondered? No, I thought, if it was short term, they would tell you this like every other car park in the USA, or indeed the planet, and also tell you the rates. When I came back just 3 days later the car park attendant hit me with an $81 dollar bill. I am absolutely disgusted with the service. You are apparently unable to communicate simple basic information to new comers. Next time I will take a luxury taxi instead and save myself a bundle. Thanks a lot.",-1

Phoenix is overall a great airport besides the lounge situation deteriorating and the lack of international flights. The Pros: - Ease of access - Good food options - Good Internet - Fast Security (unless they do the dog screening as they take some time to get setup and while they do the security checkpoint is closed) The Cons: - Major discrepancy in quality of services between terminals that are not connected - Lost it’s only Priority Pass lounge access in the afternoon - No Asia flights and maybe 1.2 flights a day to Europe (and I am generous) - If the flight to Frankfurt and London are at the terminal together it gets messy, there is no real room for international expansion - Rental car are on the other side of the planet.",1

2018-06-16,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,wouldn’t recommend to anyone,False, Check baggage services horrible. No help or limited staff. Also staff serving very unfriendly. Can’t even explain how impersonal they were. I had also assumed that the gate number printed on my ticket was correct (my fault). They could at least post at the gate that the gate had changed. So much technology and all. Security check in was super unfriendly as well. No one had even had a slight smile - aren’t they getting paid? If I could choose another airport definitely would do that. I wouldn’t recommend this airport to anyone.,-1
2018-04-27,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,"crowded, cranky service",True," I travel weekly and frequent Sky Harbor several times a month. Since I fly SW I’m usually out of Terminal 4. First off, the departure and arrival boards are not anywhere that makes sense. After arriving from the car rental you have to proceed to any of the four gates (a,b, d,d). AB one side, CD on the other. So if you walk up to the gate at A and you’re on C, you have to walk all the way across the terminal. Not enough characters to complain about everything wrong but the other peeve of mine is a complete lack of seating, one bar per gate. Clearly the “Best Airport” in my opinion is outscored by almost all others that I travel to. Cancun even beats this place. Crowded, cranky service and old. Tear it down.",-1
2018-04-09,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,3,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,It is a nightmare,True," Locating Terminal 4 parking area is almost impossible. If you have to meet someone from an international flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4, allow at least 30 extra minutes to locate the parking area. It is a nightmare! Whoever put up the signs to different parts of the airport must have been drunk when they came to point drivers towards the T4 parking area ramp. The lane the sign points to is not the right access lane, it is on a slight bend, there are numerous other signs and you end up sailing past on the constant flow of traffic. I have to pick people up regularly from T4 and it beats me every time. I have complained many times at the airport, but nothing changes. If you find it in three circumnavigations of the airport, you win a prize! Is anybody at Sky Harbor listening?",1
2018-03-25,0.2,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Dirty floors. Torn seats,False,"  Dirty floors. Torn seats. A foul and mysterious odor. Antiquated baggage claim. Jetblue only mans a desk from 8-12 pm. TSA is a joke. If you didn’t know better, you’d think you were in a third world airport. But actually, those places try to have higher standards. It is as if the airport leveraged the beautiful weather so as to compensate for the substandard conditions of Sky Harbor. Embarrassing and disappointing for such an amazing state.",-1

Poor signage. Either not enough or even helpful. Trying to pick up someone here is a challenge. No information on where to park. Short term parking is not labelled until you are unable to access the lane. Miss a parking garage because the signage is so poor, you are out of luck. Exit the airport and start all over with tons of traffic. Dealing with this airport, I’m surprised more people do not miss their flights. Very poor layout and design. New York is easier to deal with. Not the best, but better than Phoenix, at least in NY, there are friendly people guiding you in the right direction. Good luck Phoenix, your growing pains are showing.",-1
2018-03-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,TSA is a joke,True," TSA is a joke.

So much for calling themselves “the friendliest airport.” Ridiculous. Everyone was furious but of course had to comply.",-1

I told the TSA agents that he needed assistance, they still asked him all kinds of questions, he had to go through the screening booth. He couldn’t understand what was asked of him. I kept telling them he doesn’t understand but they still insisted he should go through the whole process, dismissing my suggestion that they just do a pat down or find an alternative. I had to kneel to put each of his feet on the yellow markings and show him how to get his hands up and he kept putting them down. Horrible experience overall. I talked to the supervisor and she seemed to think that the lack of sensitivity towards a disabled child is all OK! Lots of training seems to be needed for that team.",-1

Was travelling with two children and was deliberately misdirected by two male airport security employees when asked to be directed to the TSA Pre-check despite being an TSA approved traveller. No good reason for doing this except to harass a female parent travelling alone with two children. What a shame. I saw other passenger behind me being directed to TSA without hitch so I went back and entered the line without seeing their “assistance”.,-1

I was traveling with a friend who was in a different terminal so I went to the friend’s terminal to have breakfast. No one bothered to tell me I was in the wrong terminal or warn me I couldn’t get to my terminal from where I was. I had to go outside, walked a lot, and re-enter security.

2017-09-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,one of the worst airports I have been to,False,"  This airport is the one of the worst airports I have been to. It was September 5th at 4.30 am, and I was heading to Screening zone before heading to the gate. There was a huge line up at that time and they opened 3 lanes for screening. 1 for express and 2 for general boarding. Apparently a screening-machine was malfunctioning in one of the 2 general boarding lanes. Instead of opening another lane to deal with the congested line, staffs merged two lanes into one. That resulted in adding extra 10~20 minutes of everyone's waiting time and limited space for people pick up their belongings after passing the screening line. While I was picking up my belongings after passing the screening-machine, staff said ""you are taking up too much space and not letting others having the space for picking up their belongings"". This was very upsetting because all this happened due to their malfunctioning machine and merging two lanes into one. I had never problem with this kind of situation because I pick up my belongings pretty fast. Lots of people were complaining at that time but staffs did nothing about it and did not want to open another lane to deal with this situation, that was very lazy of them and stupid. There really needs to be procedures to deal with this kind of situation. Otherwise it will happen again and that would be just silly, because this is an easy fix. Hopefully whoever works in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport see this review and bring it up in their meeting and come up with better procedure for this kind of situation. Plus, the wifi is horrible too. This is 2017 and there is still issue with weak signal. Come on.",-1

2017-07-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,Baggage Claim area was abysmal,False,"  Baggage Claim area was abysmal. Frontier Airlines from COS arrived with info that bags would be on 4. No signs were at Carousel 4, but they were switched to 5. Bags came from 5, but stopped before the last bags came out. Someone noticed a flashing yellow light. No one was in the area to assist. Delta said the problem was Frontier's not theirs and we'd have to go to the ticket counter. The info counter person said she didn't have a phone and couldn't call. She has a phone. Frontier ticket counter said it's not their problem, the carousels belong to the City of Phoenix. City of Phoenix said that the carousel doesn't stop unless there's a jam and that's Frontier's problem. After about 45 minutes of this a Frontier ticket agent went into an elevator and got someone to finally react. Some mysterious guy apparently pushed on the flashing yellow light and the belts started moving. This shouldn't happen at what is claimed to be a Friendly Airport. Someone should be available to assure the carousels are working properly, regardless of which airline is using them. Bad experience.",-1

The terminals are spread out all over the place, making connections a chore. If you have a connecting flight in a different terminal than you've arrived, be prepared to walk a lot. It also seems that this airport is unable to accommodate the number of airlines/flights arriving and departing. I've taken several departing flights that have left the gate early or on time, only to end up delayed 45-60 minutes because of taxiing and other tarmac traffic delays.
