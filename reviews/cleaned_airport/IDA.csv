2022-11-24,1.0,Business,5,5,5,5,5,,5,5,TSA is efficient,True," I fly in and out of here regularly, and am very impressed. For a small airport, TSA is efficient and does not do a lot of unnecessary screening just to have something to do as at other small airports. The gate crews work very hard to get you out on-time, and luggage retrieval is easy. Rental car offices are next to baggage claim, and other than Budget, are extremely helpful. There is a coffee shop upstairs, as well as a bar/restaurant; everyone is friendly here and pricing is reasonable. Two minutes from I-15. The place seems pleasantly ignorant of airport hassles that have descended upon much of the industry.",1
