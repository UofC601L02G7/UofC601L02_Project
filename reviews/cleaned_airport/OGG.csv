2024-07-23,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,,4.0,0.0,,3.0,5.0,people we spoke to were awesome,True,"  On July 23rd we arrived at in Maui due to flight cancelations during a trip to Kauai. Sadly, my wife misplaced an expensive item in a washroom not discovering it until we had passed through security. We asked staff for assistance and the people we spoke to were awesome. They took our phone number as we're only there 1 day but recovered the item before we even left the airport. You guys most certainly brought some stress down on the start of a Hawaiian vacation for us. Mahalo!",1
2023-02-26,0.5,Family Leisure,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,This airport is desperate for some help,False,  All Day long our family reported gate issues. We had 16 people arrive today. All were parked on the tarmac for at least 30 mins. This airport is desperate for some help. If anyone can get me a gate so I can deplane I’d be grateful.,-1
2023-02-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,Sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac upon arrival,False,"  How can you accept planes and not have a gate to deplane? Sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac upon arrival and then was delayed 3.5 hours on departure. Once we boarded, we had to wait another 45 minutes for someone to put gas in our plane. Baggage claim was a hot mess. Multiple passengers getting only some of their bags. We needed to wait for two other planes to unload their luggage before getting our second bag. Hundreds of people waiting for flights that disappeared from flight boards. Lines of customers waiting to speak to service agents that came and left the area without explanation or serviced people outside of the established lines. There was another desk with three uniformed staff members carrying on conversations amongst themselves and a sign stating the desk was closed. Sassy, condescending updates far and few between. TSA line longer that regular check in.",-1
2023-01-21,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,the worst of the worst,False,"  I travel for a living and have been through most of the international airports in the US. Kahului Maui Airport, is hands down the worst of the worst. Visiting Maui isn't worth having to go through the airport here. I'll avoid it for layovers in the future as well. Save your self and avoid at all costs.",-1
2022-09-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,plain horrible in every regard,False," Just plain horrible in every regard. Arrival: waited 20 minutes on the tarmac for a gate to open, waited another 20 minutes at carousel for baggage (even after a bathroom stop!). Departure: Absolutely pointless agriculture inspection (agents don't even look!), Long line at security checkpoint, EXTREMELY rude TSA agent at escalator, our gate was not marked in main hallway - had to hunt and peck to find it, boarding agent was nothing short of a jerk, and this is the most rundown airport I have ever seen. In case you didn't get the gist of this review, this airport sucks!!!",-1
2022-04-10,0.3,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,worst TSA experience we have ever had,False,"  The worst TSA experience we have ever had. All three TSA agents were incredibly rude, even to my 9 year old son. They lacked any customer service skills at all. I have never seen such a rude security staff.",-1
2021-12-14,0.3,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,OGG really needs updating and a better design,False,"  My wife I have been coming to Maui each year for 39 years. When we first came, the airport was wide open, no real gates, no real baggage claim. Now, there are buildings but it is unwieldy. As an example, the United counter is at the far right end of the terminal, TSA is then 2/3 of the way to the left. Your first very long walk. No pre-check. Very limited food options when you finish with the TSA. Then what seems like a one mile walk to Gate 1 or 1 mile the other way to gate 39. Very few moving sidewalks especially in the lower gate numbers. OGG really needs updating and a better design. Less walking. More food. Better security checkpoint. The airport is recommended only because there is no other way to fly commercially to or from Maui.",1
2021-09-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,Security line was outrageous,True," Security line was outrageous. Longest security line ever encountered in my life. So many passengers in the airport missed their flights, I bet it must have set a record. Some airlines like American delayed their departure, but of all airlines, you’d think Hawaiian would have delayed theirs, but no. The airport was filled with passengers who missed their flights on all airlines due to the ineptness of the airport. This needs to be addressed. This is a disgrace! This cost how many people extra $$$ without any sympathy from the airport.",-1
2021-08-05,0.4,Family Leisure,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,Staff were extremely rude and obnoxious,False,"  The airport itself was nice but the TSA was horrible. Staff were extremely rude and obnoxious. If you asked any questions about the process they mocked you and made you feel stupid even though there were no signs posted about what you can and can not bring on a plane. I was told by one staffer that bottled water has never been allowed on planes since the beginning of time, which is a lie. The floors where you have to walk barefoot was very dirty and sticky and they treat you like cattle, yelling and pointing at you like a prisoner. They would throw your carry on luggage around like a beach ball. Once you get past that it’s a nice airport.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,this airport is a super spreader event in progress,False,"  During covid pandemic huge lines - no distancing in lines or seating or on flight. No mask enforcement. Basically this airport is a super spreader event in progress. Shame on the state of Hawaii, shame on the county of Maui, shame on Maui airport and shame on Southwest Airlines. Understaffed, impatient and rude at all levels Maybe this review should be titled - there’s a pandemic but what the heck we can still milk profits. 600,000 dead - what’s a few more.",-1
2021-07-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Disorganized, slow, unnecessarily aggressive",False,"  Very old and out of date but TSA security was insane. One line for everyone. One agent interrogating a 3yr old and 5 yr old as to their birthdates, their siblings birthdates, their parents birthdates, where their parents worked, etc. Have they never met a child that age? Kids were scared to death to answer and the agents were very rough and separated kids from the parents. They did this to at least 4 families I witnessed. Disorganized, slow, unnecessarily aggressive, and despite having at least 3 screening machines, only ran one. I hear the residents are mad so many tourists are coming to the island at this time as it’s a burden on all their water and food supply. Keep treating visitors like this and you won’t have to worry about it. The rest of the world will open up and, like me, we will go elsewhere and Maui can figure out another income industry.",-1
2021-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Very unpleasant staff,False,"  Very unpleasant staff at shuttle for car rentals. Demeaning and condescending young female worker, 0 percent Aloha. Sending people off with a bad taste in their mouth.",-1
2021-06-21,0.3,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,5.0,3hrs in line for agriculture inspection and TSA,False,"  Flight was at 12:25pm from Maui to Oakland, CA. Waited 3hrs in line for agriculture inspection and TSA. Almost missed our flight. Lines were 3-4 blocks long at snail pace. Very stressful. Employees working there were very helpful and friendly, but over worked.",-1
2020-08-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,no one enforced any rules,False,"  One of the employees stood at the men's bathroom door, unmasked and chewing for an hour. People eating with masks off everywhere in waiting area. Another man was coughing everywhere with no mask on and no one enforced any rules. No wonder Maui's cases have been going up. I understand the laid back vibe of Hawaii, but there are times when things need to be tightened up so you don't end up killing others with a virus. This was worst case scenario for me. I won't be traveling any time soon after this loose ended experience. Be careful. They don't enforce anything in Maui.",-1
2019-05-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,the worst airport ever,True, This is literally the worst airport ever! I mean 3rd world country level and lower! There is no proper air conditioning. Rest rooms are extremely dirty! Long TSA lines without adequate lines for the number of passengers! Just horrible for a place which makes lots of money from tourism!,-1
2019-04-19,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,staff were very pleasant,True,"  All of the staff were very pleasant, please give them better facilities to work in! The bathrooms are very small and outdated, one of the three sinks was broken and there were only four small and old stalls. The gate area was air conditioned, which was nice, but was very cramped and not in the best condition.",-1
2018-09-18,0.7,Business,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,Departure was better than Arrival,False,  Departure was better than Arrival. Arrival wasn't marked very well leading some passengers off in the wrong directions. The rental car terminal at the arrival gate is closed and you need to go behind it to get a bus to the real rental car terminals. If you don't ask around it is difficult to find. Departure rental buses take you right to the ticketing area. There are several restaurant options and some reasonably prices places to buy gifts.,1
2018-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no basic human kindness whatsoever,True," I love visiting Maui but I don’t know if I want to deal with Hawaii airports anymore. This time, I was with my young daughter. The counter attendants literally walked away as we were checking in and didn’t come back! Then the machine printing baggage tags malfunctioned and since they had left, there was no one to help us. Finally the guy directing our places in line felt bad for us and asked one of the other attendants to help, and she made a really big deal about coming to the other side of the counter to help us! At the gate—no stores. I had bad heartburn at this point so I wandered back to shop for an antacid or something and left my daughter with our stuff at the gate. No luck, only jewelry, souvenirs and a restaurant, so I approached a security guard to ask—and lo and behold I crossed the “magic line” (that’s what he said!) and was out of the security zone. Many tears ensued as my petrified daughter had to find me and schlep all our stuff along to give me my boarding pass so I could go back through the TSA screening and then they forgot to tell her I needed my ID so we went through it all again, now we are getting really close to being late for our plane and my poor daughter is alone up there as I frantically try to get back to her (of course no one could help me get through the now-huge line any faster to get back to her). It’s just such an awful feeling to be surrounded by so many people that have no basic human kindness whatsoever.",-1
2018-05-31,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,shout at passengers continually,False,"  I have travelled out of many airports in my life and have never been so ill treated as I was at OGG airport in Maui. TSA agents shout at passengers continually, they are so verbally abusive to all. They pull your bagage apart in a rough manner and shove things back in in a very messy way. Nowhere to sit to tie your laces after taking your shoes off. No Nexus line. No smile from anyone and certainly no please or thank you.You wouldn't know you're in a US airport. Things would move much more swiftly if passengers were not so intimidated. Never going back to Maui.",-1
2018-04-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"a horrible way to end a vacation""
",False,"  We always enjoy our time on Maui, but departing from Kahului OGG, is a horrible way to end a vacation. Long, inadequate security lines, surly customer service, poorly sanitized facilities, limited eating choices, and malfunctioning infrastructure are just a few of the issues at this airport. The Maui community and their guests deserve better.",-1
2018-02-09,0.3,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,5.0,be prepared to be very uncomfortable,False,  The lack of seating in the check in area is totally unacceptable. If you have to get there early be prepared to be very uncomfortable. Once you check in and clear security they have seating and services. Make sure you don't arrive before your check in desk opens.,-1
