2024-09-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,3,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,rude and yelling at people,True,"   The employees in baggage, customs, and particularly the security area before catching connecting flights, were rude and yelling at people. Even the lady announcing luggage claim carousel on the intercom was too loud and sounded angry. This has been a problem for a long time. Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the horrible first impressions for foreigners entering the US. Fix it please.",-1

2024-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,2,4,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,a mad house with no structure,False,"   On 18 July I traveled to Hartsfield-jackson airport to pick up my daughter and family. I have traveled throughout the US, Europe and Asia. The experience in Atlanta airport was the worst in my 75 years on this earth. All parking on the domestic side was full. I was directed to the International terminal parking by one of the many rude employees there. In the end, I parked off site until my daughter arrived picking her up at exit S2. Honestly, 'the fish rots from the head down' I ask that Governor Kemp order a top down evaluation of senior management at the Atlanta airport. The place is a mad house with no structure and few employees who care a whit about the clientele. Suggest they use the airport in Seoul to model their way ahead. If the Koreans can get it so right so can we Americans.",-1
2024-07-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,never seen such foolishness,True,"  Never connect through ATL on an international flight. You have people getting off flights from 2 different ends of the airport and one side has to walk all the way to the other side to get in line behind hundreds of people. Once you make it through customs and show your passport, then you pick up your checked bags and redeposit them around the corner. At this point you think you are done and can head to your gate, but no. Now you have to wait in another long line to go through security again. This is after you have been on a long international flight. Like seriously, what could I have picked up from the jet bridge to standing in the customs line? You finally make it through security and then you have to catch the train to your terminal! I have never seen such foolishness! None of this makes sense at all! If I cleared security once, why should I have to do it again?  There has to be some logic, but I don't understand it!",-1
2024-07-04,0.2,Business,1,4,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,opposite from progress,False,"   A couple of illogicals at Hartsfield. Arriving from international flight to get to Marta (as instructed by 3 different staff) traveler is required to go through the security checkpoint. This not just inconveniences tired traveler arriving from international flight that has already gone through customs, but also additionally chokes always long security check lines. At domestic terminal 3 of the staff man entrance to restrooms, and if you're arriving from the ticket counter side they instruct you to go around, back through food court, by entrance to security checkpoint and only if you're arriving from that side you can enter the restroom. Not only inconvenience to traveler but also waste time of 3 if the staff. Is that really necessary? It seems Hartsfield is moving in direction opposite from progress.",1
2024-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,some of the most rude people,False," This was my absolute worst experience I’ve ever had in an airport. It was not just the TSA although yes, they were their typical bossy, irritating organization. But the staff trying to guide us from an international arrival through passport, control, and baggage retrieval and whatever else were some of the most rude people I’ve ever encountered. I was so upset that this was going to be some of the people on my flights first experience in the United States, and they’re being yelled at and laughed at. If you fly, you know that an unfamiliar airport can be confusing. People would ask questions. Sometimes two people would ask the same question. One person I gave my passport to just flick his wrist slightly and looked at me like this. Is your passport take it the security wanted to see inside my bag and set it aside. It sat completely unattended for 10 minutes. I didn’t want to say anything to anybody because by this point, my experience had been so lousy, I figured they would purposely extend it and I might miss my connection. Restaurants are overcrowded lines of 100 people long at a Wendy’s. Bathrooms you can’t navigate because they’re too tight and people are toting bags all over the place. Flights that get delayed are not uncommon, but they seem to be more than common at this airport. I will purposely pay extra to never have to fly through this airport again. If I never see Atlanta, I will be happy. Who has a hub there, needs to act or they are going to lose customers. Because I have zero interest of flying through their hub ever again.",-1
2024-06-10,0.3,Business,1,2,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,"worthwhile to avoid ATL"" ",False,"   This airport is to be avoided if at all possible. Like many large airports, it is very busy; unlike many other airports, though, the vast majority of staff have no interest in helping anyone. Parking is full - staff waves you away without any information about alternative lots. Baggage check lines are long, staff sits on their butts, occasionally helping a customer every 5 minutes or so. Security officers are so busy yelling instructions to everyone that they can't answer a question, then lose their marbles if you do something wrong (I took my laptop out of my case like the majority of other security lines; the women started screaming like I was a child). Most restaurants inside the airport have employees staring at their cell phones, and both the service time and food quality reflect this. The only positive I can write is that this airport does allow direct flights to many places. However, I have begun to look at other airports (e.g., Columbia, SC and Charlotte, NC) to use - the extra hour or two drive is worthwhile to avoid ATL.",-1
2024-06-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no clear directions in airport,False,"   Our first flight was a bit late, no clear directions in airport and most of the staff are mean as hell and look lost themselves. Be warned, you won't have time to get all the way across the airport and catch a connecting flight they end all boarding sessions 30 minutes early so it is very misleading and the staff are very mean spirited.",-1
2024-06-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,“the least convenient airport experience”,True," Atlanta wants to be an international city but the international terminal at Heathrow provides the least convenient airport experience I have ever encountered. On arrival in Atlanta, if you want to take public transport — the MARTA subway train — you have to get a bus from the international terminal back to the domestic terminal where the train station is located. The busses run infrequently, are hard to identify, crowded, and are manned by surly drivers, They drive you around the whole large airport so it takes around 45 minutes. We’d already waited that long for a bus just to come AND spent an hour getting through a long passport control queue. Why London airports can have e-gates you breeze through in minutes and Atlanta cannot is beyond me. If you think you’ll avoid all this hassle by renting a car, think again as to access the rental car centre you have to take the same slow airport bus to domestic PLUS then a shuttle out to the rental hub. All of it adds up to it taking a very long time to just get away from the airport after an already long international flight. Signage after baggage pick-up is also very poor which makes me feel very sorry for non-English speakers or really anyone arriving in Atlanta for the first time.",-1
2024-05-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,2,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,numerous stalls out of service,True,"  TSA wait on Monday 5/13/24 was over an hour with 3 TSA people working. I was also told that I could leave my iPad in my carryon, but at BOS Logan, that was not allowed and further it had to be placed in a separate bin. I appreciate security, and would also appreciate that they are trained properly. What else goes through unseen?  Departing BOS Delta 363 on Friday 5/17/24 arriving ATL Terminal A, the ladies restroom line spilled well out onto the concourse. When I got inside, there were numerous stalls out of service, several sinks out of service and no soap in several dispensers. Logan airport was super clean and very nice. Surely ATL can do better.",-1
2024-05-13,0.2,Business,1,2,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Clear staff are horrible,False,"   Unfortunately this is my new home airport. I travel every other week for work from ATL to several other cities. The staff at ATL airport is by far the worst I’ve seen at any airport. Clear staff are horrible! I’ve had a problem with my ID the last 5-7 times I’ve gone through and no one has said why, then I go to New Orleans and Orlando Airport and they both told me what the issue was and how to fix it. Security and TSA are rude and power hungry. They scream across the lobby at guests, they ignore any questions and treat travelers as if we are beneath them-all because they know you will comply because you have no other choice. They are bullies. Almost anyone you speak to at the airport acts like they are annoyed that they have to do their job. I’m actually shocked when someone is friendly.",-1
2024-05-10,0.2,Family Leisure,2,3,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,not people friendly,False,"   Me and my sister are flying out of country for the first time. During our time in this airport, we’ve had to ask where to go, what to do, etc., which is expected from newbie travelers. Every staff member, employee, and retail worker that we’ve experienced so far from McDonald’s to the Info desk has been nothing but rude. Horrible attitudes, not people friendly, and seems like they do not like taking the time out of their jobs to answer questions. I have been here for about 12 hours on a long connection, have gained very little answers to my questions, and I have met no kind people who work in this airport.",-1

Frontier is having issues with their app and were not helpful. Thought I was given a ticket, but it was not a boarding pass. After my 2nd trek back to the Frontier counter and heading for my 3rd, Kelvin not only got me fixed up and thru security quickly. I am in my late 60s and his help was greatly appreciated.",1
2024-04-29,0.6,Couple Leisure,1,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,just a very bad experience,True,"  My husband and I flew into Atlanta from Amsterdam on April 25, 2024. We had a connecting flight to Birmingham, AL following that flight that we needed to make. When we reached the Custom's line we realized that the line was extremely long and slow moving. We had enough of a layover where there should have been plenty of time to make it to where we needed to be, but there were only a few custom's officers working the arrival of an entire international flight. We asked for help from multiple employees so that we could make our connecting flight and were told that they could not help us. We were told that we would just have to miss our flight and reschedule it for the next day! This was extremely frustrating because we had recently had a similar experience in Amsterdam where the staff there had bent over backwards and had done everything in their power to help us make our flight.... so we knew that things could be done better. They have a system worked out to assist passengers with occurrences like these. Atlanta employees need to take a training class from the Amsterdam airport. I would have expected so much more from such a large airport (in the United States no less), for which I guess I just had higher expectations. We were able to make our connecting flight but only because we had to make a desperate run through an extremely large airport which left us feeling miserable, exhausted, and stressed. All in all, it was just a very bad experience that didn't have to happen. Do better Atlanta!!",-1
2024-04-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,“one of the worst in the USA”,True," Atlanta international airport is by far one of the worst in the USA. The customs process is excruciating, the officers don’t know how to properly separate the visitors and citizens line, the process to travel from the international terminal to domestic or for a rental car is by way of one shuttle bus that runs every 25 mins. This is by far the worst process I have ever seen in an airport, 3rd world countries do a whole better job than this, this is just flat out horrible.",-1
2024-04-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,disgusted with the staff there,False,"  I am horrified at the ignorance and lack of knowledge of the airport staff. There is a complete ""it's not my problem"" or ""I can't help you"" attitude ingrained in the work culture there. There is no way I should be led on a wild goose chase around the airport because no one has a clue or cares to find out where I was supposed to get my connecting flight. I wasn't allowed on my flight when I got to the gate with 5 min to spare. It is appalling the lack of knowledge from the staff and then being met with shrugs. I'm absolutely disgusted with the staff there.",-1
2024-03-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,did not supply the wheelchair assistance,True,"  We had a horrible experience because they did not supply the wheelchair assistance that we requested. Our trip was from Salt Lake City to Atlanta then to Liberia, Costa Rico. Our trip home, we made a point of asking for wheelchair assistance. On our trip home, our flight was delayed an hour, so we had less time to go through customs. The wheelchair assistance was not there when we exited the terminal. There was a stray wheelchair so my wife pushed me. We kept on asking airport personnel for help and they kept on saying it is not my job. Some people offered to get someone, but that never panned out. When we picked up our bags because it was an international flight, we had three bags on the wheelchair with Ken (the person in the wheelchair) holding a wheeled 40 lb bag with a duffle bag attached to it while his wife tried to navigate to customs. At one point, a TSA official asked to take our bags, which we accepted. However we thought they would stay with us but they disappeared. We finally found the wheelchair assistance people and they did get us assistance, but was irritated that we were upset. They told us that our bags would be at our final destination and to quit worrying. They eventually took us to our terminal, although the person whined about how far it was. When we got there, the doors were closed but Delta allowed us to board. In Salt Lake, the wheelchair assistance was there and cheerfully helped us get to the luggage claim. However, I got a text from Delta stating that our luggage was still in Atlanta.",-1
2024-03-05,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,“obvious lack of training”,True," Not only did one of the biggest airports in the US cannot open enough security lanes, but also there are over 100 TSA agents who do absolutely nothing and berate people while they are going through security. I waited an hour through security so to people who did the body scan berated me about my appearance and shirt. It’s too early in the morning and not warranted to be treating your customers this way. We pay good money for flights that are overpriced anyway. The least we can get is 5-star customer service. There is obvious lack of training, lack of discipline, and lack of vetting your employees to see if they have experience working with customers. Ridiculous.",-1
2024-02-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,3,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,two hours to snake through the initial screening,False,"  My husband and I returned from Italy January 24th, 2024. We had a lay-over in Atlanta and went through customs at the Atlanta airport. We were diverted to the line with connecting flights. It took two hours to snake through the initial screening, grab our bags, go through a second line, and finally go through TSA security. The lines all moved at a glacial pace. When we finally were at TSA to X-ray the bags, there were two lines: one moved efficiently, the line we were in was a nightmare. The agents working the screening chatted with each other, stood by sipping water, and blowing battery-powered fans at their faces. My husband and I just made our connecting flight to IAD.",-1
2024-02-19,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,“the rudest TSA agents ever”,False," The longest TSA line with the rudest TSA agents ever. One actually made an announcement that we needed to get on the ""same page, same chapter, same book"" because we were irritating her as it should be a quick process. If you have not traveled to an airport with the same type of system, how would one know?? It would be more professional to intermittently provide a courtesy announcement of how the system works.",-1
2023-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,some of the most rudest workers ever,False,"  Out of all the places that I’ve traveled in this world, Atlanta has some of the most rudest workers ever. They speak to customers as if they’re angry for having to perform their jobs. Remember, who’s paying your salaries. If you’re not happy doing your job then I suggest that you go into another occupation. To add insult to injury, upon my return from a previous trip, someone had broken into my vehicle, located right next to security cameras. I reported it to the police and media and was told that the airport would pay for the repairs. That never happened. Moreover, I’m convinced that it was an inside job.",-1
2023-12-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst of the worst airports,False,"  The worst of the worst airports. Good luck finding anything with the lack of signage and the nasty attitude exhibited by all employees. I’ve flown with Delta the past three times out of this airport and they overbook the flight every time, making an already abysmal experience at this airport even worse. This airport needs to be heavily fined for its sins.",-1
2023-12-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,4,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,most inefficient and rude staff,False,"  Chaotic and least effective airport. TSA in Atlanta airport has the most inefficient and rude staff I have encountered at any airport. They all need a course on customer service. I arrived at 9pm at the domestic departure, experienced Long line 200+ passengers were waiting and only 3 security tables were open!  Staff were rude and useless. TSA and CLEAR closed early and there's no special lane to handle the irregular cases. Apparently, staff were customed to observing bottlenecks and didn't even aware there was an issue! They should adjust accordingly whenever they see traffic jam, like most average airports would open more security tables at rush hour. I will avoid to transfer to ATL Hartsfield ever!",-1
2023-12-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,4,3,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,dysfunction is the TSA process,True,"  I’ve lived outside of the US for many years and have experienced many airports all over the world. Some were good and others, not as good. Common elements I’ve found in good airports is professionalism and positive interaction with customers. My experience with the Atlanta airport contained neither of these elements. The primary area of dysfunction is the TSA process. General interaction that staff has with customers is unprofessional. No instructions given to people when approaching the document scanner, then being rude when someone is confused about the process. I did not observe any positive interaction between security staff and customers. After getting this sense, I looked for positivity and saw no eye contact or smiles, but rather what appeared to be contempt for customers. I realize that airport security would be a difficult job, and that you would feel like you are dealing with the same issue over and over. However, I have been through countless airports where security was professional and positive. Everyone has to go through security, so a good experience is crucial to a positive view of the airport. Atlanta airport has many great features, but I would not recommend it to anyone based on the TSA experience. That is how negatively it impressed me. This area should be addressed to improve service to customers and make the airport what it is capable of being.",-1
2023-12-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,2,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,4.0,a very confusing airport,False,"  This is a very confusing airport. Too few signs giving directions and also to many needless signs and advertisement that clutter your attention. Also, way too few screens displaying flight departure information. Finally, not enough food stands for the amount of foot traffic. I will try to avoid Hartsfield the next time I need a connecting flight.",-1
2023-12-01,0.3,Business,4,4,2.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,"Concourse D was tragic, it felt dreary",True,"  I had a connection from Boston to South Bend on Delta airlines. Traveling through the terminal was easy enough, and the plane train was simple. My experience though in Concourse D was tragic. It felt dreary like it was an afterthought and the two restaurants I went to acted like I was an inconvenience. The first (Mustard seed) had me sitting there for a bit before finally letting me know the kitchen was closed, at 6:45pm. And the next, all 3 employees decided they wanted to be on their phones instead of help a guest. Its sad because I grew up in ATL area and used to fly out of Hartsfield all the time. I have fond memories, but nostalgia wasn't enough to save this experience. I will probably avoid Delta just to avoid having a flight connection here",-1

2023-10-29,0.3,Family Leisure,3,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,ATL airport is poorly run,False,"  I fly often, domestic and occasionally international. ATL airport is poorly run as compared to other airports. It is always understaffed and very chaotic. There's never a wheelchair attendant available upon departure. I always have a family member push me to the gate, after obtaining a special pass. This is never necessary to do upon departing other airports, only Atlanta! They are fairly good at providing attendants upon de-planing. However, one afternoon there was 1 attendant for 7 wheelchairs. One by one she pushed us from the jetway to the terminal and there we sat for 1 hr. Those of us who could walk a little, we decided to attempt to walk to the plane train, by holding the wheelchair and walk behind it. The TSA line for wheelchair people is ridiculous. No one is there to supervise the bottleneck of abandoned wheelchairs as we wobble pass the checkpoint. Do not blame the attendants! Its not their fault! Its the fault of the upper managers because they are not doing a good job of managing! It's shameful! The last trip I took there was a manager at the TSA line who was drunk and stepping on people and bumping into us and he was loud and laughing and clowning around with workers. Atlanta airport is disgusting!",-1
2023-10-24,0.6,Business,3,4,,4.0,0.0,,3.0,3.0,balmy 80 degrees inside,False," This is my home airport. It’s not bad considering the volume of people that pass through every day. TSA needs to be fully staffed and all machines working for the M-F business crowd. Also, why so hot? It’s barely fall and the airport is a balmy 80 degrees inside. Save energy, save the planet and keep it cooler. You’ve got people in the sky club stripped down to their tees. Seriously.",1
2023-10-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,5,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,nightmare of traveling through ATL,True," 1. After completing terminal F, for international travel, many years ago. Most international flights still depart from the E and T gates. 2. While the number of gates at F are limited, there is not adequate accommodation made for arriving passengers. Instead, if arriving into an E gate and it may be on either end of the concourse, they must walk about two miles, with limited moving walkways to F gate international passport control. After all of the years that have past since completion of terminal F one would expect a solution by now. 3. Being assigned for international travel at the E gates also means you suffer the absolute chaos of dining in the central part of this concourse where, for example, there is only one coffee shop, for all of terminal E. 4. Upon exiting passport control that can be hit or miss as to ordered chaos or mayhem, one has to wait upon luggage where despite at least 6 carousels, only two may be in use, each covering several flights. This does not make any sense to me. 5. If you had done the right airport recommended parking for the international Park & Ride (the receipt says Park ATL), standby for more chaos as you exit the concourse. There are several park and ride signs on different pillars along the first pavement. However unmarked is a pillar with queuing column tape that is for white (seemingly) unmarked minibuses. These are the transport to the park and ride (that by the way should say Park ATL, same as the receipt that I paid against). 6. I can only guess that those who design, upgrade or manage ATL do not travel, themselves. International arriving passengers that arrive there are often tired, disorientated and brain fogged. Even those who have travelled through ATL extensively and live in GA, are not immune to the chaos. 7. I would not say the on site staff and ATL are rude, but they are certainly not too friendly. Returning to the US feels like the first day you report for duty in the military or I guess, arrival to start a prison sentence. This is not the America I want to project and I am sure you don't either. 8. Sadly, there is no excuse for the atrocious state of ATL and it seems that someone needs to find another career. I have little desire to fly in or out of ATL, and I do not like the airline connections from my nearest airport, here in North GA. So, if anyone from Delta is reading this, yes, it affects you too, because my wife and I will be thinking twice before we undertake the nightmare of traveling through ATL again.",-1

It took me 45 minutes to get through from the moment I walked into the terminal to getting through. Moreover, the TSA Pre signage takes you on this roundabout path through the terminal.

Also motion detection for trash. Everything else that matters much more - such as getting from concourse to concourse is not good. This airport is designed poorly. I’ve never had to walk so much to where I almost miss my flight due to the time it took! The team has confusing messaging - causing everyone to get off on the wrong stops - hint: the wall has the correct concourse don’t pay attention to the lights inside (or lack thereof) bc they change colors for the next stop as the door opens- causing chaos and toes to be rolled over bc everyone is worries they will miss their flights. I went directly past concourse A due to poor signage… had to hop back on and go backwards. Lastly - the doors close even if someone is in the way- I saw a guys bag almost get ripped off as the tram took off- it warned that someone was blocking the door from Closing but started driving away -scary! What if that was a child?,-1

Surprisingly my departure from ATL was uneventful that day. I arrived back home on Sunday 8/13/203. The train to baggage claim went to T gate, so I had to get off and walk and go up an escalator that had only 2 up escalators. The elevators weren't working. We had to then snake around to the security door on the southside and go through a glass security door. The door kept getting stuck because there are hundreds or maybe even thousands of people going through this door. The door got stuck and instead of the airport employee holding the door open she is hollering and clapping her hands and snapping her fingers like she is talking dealing with a herd of cattle, or a bunch dogs. This process of the train being down and having to walk to baggage claim seems to be the normal and not the exception. The airport workers are rude and do not offer assistance at all. When you ask for help, they are rude. On another travel experience I was leaving for Houston early morning, I was at the airport by 4 am and instead of the security checkpoint being open on the North terminal, everyone had to go through the main security terminal, thousands of people at 4-5 am and their explanation was the North terminal does not open until  5: 45. This is the most poorly run airport I have ever been to. I am afraid to invite my family and friends to visit because of the inefficiency...",-1
2023-08-07,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,charging ports not connected to power,True, This airport is the worst. Flight cancelled and they let us wonder around this hell hole for 15 hrs. Pushing the next flight back over and over. Then sending us back and forth between terminals and every time there we fewer and fewer seat for all the passengers Most had to stand. The charging ports were not connected to a power source. They had no where for the smokers to have a much needed cig. We would have to leave completely and start over thru TSA. I will tell everyone to avoid this airport and Delta. They just dont care for your needs. They just want the money. Its pathetic.,-1
2023-07-13,0.3,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,this isn't a very nice airport,True,"  Their oft-repeating recorded message about this airport being the busiest and most efficient in the world is only half true. Busiest? Yes. Most-efficient? No. On its own, this isn't a very nice airport. When compared to airports like Reagan National, it's downright pathetic. The workers at the vendors were okay but the TSA staff were horrible. The facilities are adequate at best. They do have some nice art but they placed it outside the secured area (i.e., if you visit it, you'll be forced to go back through the slow security lines and deal with the rude TSA agents). Plus, the art is in a very high-traffic area on the way to/from baggage claims so stopping to look at anything is going to put you in the way of people who are already unhappy because they're being subjected to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. If you're stuck there overnight as I was, good luck finding food. Most of the vendors close. I was able to get food at the Burger King away from the terminals. Did I get a tasty Whopper? Nope. Burger King was out of burgers so I had to settle for something else. It wasn't very good. At least I was serenaded nearly the entire time I ate with a recorded message—Yes, they love recorded messages!—telling me that an emergency had been reported in the building and I was to stand by for further instruction (that never came).",-1
2023-07-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,every staff member was absolutely rude,False," I showed up to this airport a hour early and from the moment I checked our bag in every staff member was absolutely rude and I helped to anyone. There was a lot of confusion because none of the staff did their job. Walking through I heard many arguments between staff and random people flying and 10/10 of every argument was due to the hostility from the workers. I’ve never seen such a poorly managed airport, I showed up super early and missed my flight by two minutes. Honestly if I blame anyone it would be the staff, what a waste of a billion dollar company. It’s legit TRASH. After missing my flight I had one nice person that put us on a different plane and was very helpful and kind. She was the only one out of 20 people that I ran into. I will not be flying ever again on any flights due to my experience.",-1
2023-07-08,0.4,Family Leisure,3,3,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,Worst airport ever for baggage claim,False,"  Security lines were good and efficient. Food options were terrible, not enough of them and lines were to long. Baggage claim takes forever. Worst airport ever for baggage claim.",-1
2023-07-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,"absolute chaos, rude unhelpful staff",True,"  Sunday June 11, 2023 at 8:30 PM or so. ATL Airport was absolute chaos, rude unhelpful staff. Had a hard time getting thru Security because they would not let get behind security to wait for early morning flight the next day in the Airport, so I could fill more safe while waiting on my flight at 06:00 AM. June 12, 2023, because there was 4 hours rule set by SWA Airlines not TSA. TSA had 12 Or 24 Hours that you could go behind Security to wait at gate until your flight Leave rule. I tried to explain to them I did not feel safe waiting outside of TSA Check in point, TSA was okay with as long as I had A Board Pass which I did finally get after I called Southwest for assistance.",-1
2023-07-01,0.2,Business,3,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,TSA staff are consistently rude,False,"  I avoid this airport whenever I can! The TSA staff are consistently rude, but in August 2022, they proved to be lazy as well. I tried to show my ID to the TSA, which was greeted with a gruff ""I don't need to see that! Move along!"" How many other people do they say that to?",-1
2023-06-26,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,"One of the most mismanaged, dirtiest airports",True," One of the most mismanaged, dirtiest airports. The bathrooms are nasty. Garbage overflows in the gate waiting areas as there is also trash and food all over the floors. One storm rolls through and you are shoulder to shoulder with tens of thousands of people. Then you get shuffled gate to gate through multiple changes. This little 20 minute storm causes a 7 hour delay! Restaurants and food kiosks close up and it’s 1 in the morning and no place to get food or even water for hours. They are the worst. Rude staff too. Avoid if at all possible! Oh, after multiple gates, we had to go to new concourse, but the train stopped working for the night. Long long walk.",-1
2023-06-21,0.2,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,rude unhelpful airport staff,False,"  Absolute chaos, rude unhelpful airport staff. Delays in security non functional internal transportation, over a 20 min walk to get to baggage and then a 50 min wait for hotel shuttle because they can only have 4 loading at one time. Good thing that this is no longer the worlds busiest airport. What an absolute embarrassment.",-1
2023-06-12,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,1,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Busy should not foster incompetence,False," Hartsfield-Jackson airport has an unbelievable level of incompetence! Our entire experience was a nightmare. Starting from lack of parking when traveling with a blind person, to employees sleeping on the second level from the ramp from the second floor parking deck, misinformation from staff, horrible wheelchair services and not so customer friendly customer agents. Awful! And to make matters worst, when trying to voice my concerns with a rep that I was referred to, most a the conversation was dedicated to him attempting to justify with me why I was not seeing the whole picture. If I hear one more person attempt to justify incompetence by citing ""Atlanta is one of the busiest airports in the world"" I think I'll scream. Busy should not foster incompetence. If ever there is a vote for another entity to oversee the airport, I will vote for it! These people should be held accountable to do better.",-1

The stores’ credit card machines were down so I couldn’t get the food or drink there. Then, while I was at the vending machines, they had a place to tap the card - that wasn’t working either. The train to the other concourse was very efficient and trains cam around much more often that in other airports!",1
2023-06-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,1,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,never encountered more rude people,True,"  I am pretty sure I have never encountered more rude people in such a short amount my of time. First we tried to get coffee at a bar (cause we wanted Baileys in it) and the lady rudely states, why don't you go to Starbucks? Then told us they didn't have coffee even though we could clearly see a fresh pot behind the bar. We proceeded to another bar, which was filthy, and sat down. We were ignored for probably 10 minutes while the sole bartender helped other people, etc. Another man came in and sat down, and she immediately waited in him, still ignoring us. On top of that, airline employees pushing wheelchairs without a care in the world who they are about the run into. You better move quickly for them or I'm pretty sure they will run you over.",-1

It sat there for three days until the battery died. No replies to any of my emails. Then this, “Despite our best efforts, your item was not found. Your case is closed.” They should all be fired for laziness, incompetence, and not doing their job.",-1
2023-05-28,0.1,Business,1,1,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,security to bathrooms were so dirty,False,"  Filthy dirty! Every space from security to bathrooms were so dirty. Staff walking the gate areas on their phones and unable to offer assistance. Not a positive experience. On a more positive note, Delta airlines customer service was great and the gate areas provided comfortable seating and a relatively clean space for waiting.",-1
2023-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst experience ever,False,"  Worst experience ever. TSA not good anyway, but this was just thuggery and shouting. Luckily, you can just stare them out - don't react! Poor transit, rude staff except the Delta desk who had to sort out accommodation. This event was purely due to staff at Atlanta. Avoid if at all possible.",-1

2023-04-04,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,3,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,staff rude and unprofessional,False,  Airport staff rude and unprofessional. Signs are confusing. Security lines are too long. Misguided by airport staff. Delta rep at terminal was rude. Won’t be flying to Atlanta anytime soon.,-1
2023-03-27,0.3,Business,2,2,2.0,2.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,unorganized and disrespectful airport,True,  This is the most unorganized and disrespectful airport I've ever seen the TSA Staff tends to be obnoxious and overbearing with a sense of entitlement it's only job. A little common courtesy goes a long way at 5 a.m. if you don't like being up then quit by all means. I asked a gentlemen which way was ride share he said I don't know but you work here am I right i asked the young man. That was Sunday night the 26th of March on my flight from DFW to Atlanta on AA flight 2365 make no mistake I'm not sugar coating how horrible your customer service is or lack thereof. Everyone seems to be standing around and not being that so called ambassador of the busiest airport more like the laziest between texts and mindless chatter and walking around the free money must be good. My wife and I travel frequent for family and jobs so this is not my first experience at Hartsfield but I'm hoping my last so take what you will and either grow and educate or continue your pattern of turning a blind eye but it's obvious daily.,-1
2023-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,2,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,worst experience trying to leave,False,"  When we went to leave in the pay-to-park lot, the machines would not recognize the ticket we got when we pulled in. He tried in three different pay-exit lane machines, but they all said the ticket could not be read. Two booths were supposed to have people working in them, but neither one of them did. He pressed the help button, and an attendant came on and told us to ask someone in the booths. He told her the two booths were empty. She said, ""hold on, I'll be there in a second...20 minutes later, she finally showed up and proceeded to ignore us and went over to investigate a broken gate at one of the booths instead. WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR 25 minutes now, waiting to pay to leave the airport parking lot! She took her sweet time, did a few things, screwed around on a phone call, then went into the booth and called another worker who eventually showed up and just removed the entire gate. Finally, she says, ""Ok, go ahead and pay."" We paid for the total amount for the four days we were parked there and finally left....40 MINUTES LATER! WHY DON'T THEY HAVE ANYONE WORKING THE EXIT GATES IN THE TWO BOOTHS AT THE PAY-TO-PARK LOT? If they did, we could have been out on the road heading home a LOT sooner! Absolutely the worst experience trying to leave!",-1
2023-03-13,0.3,Business,4,3,,1.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,Only sporadic signs,True," Only sporadic signs directing arriving passengers to ground transportation. There’s obviously construction going on with missing ceiling tiles and scaffolding. Many airport staff but mostly just sitting around at 6am. No information booth. What the heck is a checkpoint? I just need to know where to catch my Uber, which turned out to be far away on the edge of a parking structure. Very disorganized and 3rd world country vibe. Only plus was that the bathroom was clean and plenty of shops were open.",-1

2023-01-05,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst baggage collection and car rental experience,True, Worst baggage collection and car rental experience. This airport is a zoo and the employees are of no help. Waited nearly an hour for a little bus to take us to Hertz. Packed bus and the ride took 30 min. It was hot and several of us were getting car sick. This was after an 11 hour delayed flight from London. Avoid Atlanta Airport.,-1
2022-11-29,0.3,Family Leisure,4,4,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,I dread it,True," I have been through this airport many times. I dread it. Not because it’s usually busy but some of the TSA representatives are very rude. They yell at you like you are an idiot. This time it was organized well & the TSA representative who organized the line was professional. However, the TSA representative who set up people of 2 to walk passed the K9s was extremely rude and yelled at other passengers. We are made to feel like cattle or worse. Then after this experience I was yelled at by a Coffee Bean employee because I wasn’t speaking loud enough with my mask on. She had the meanest look on her face. Like I was assaulting her. If my family wasn’t living in the Atlanta area, I would avoid going to Atlanta. It’s a shame because it’s a nice city. Every airport employee needs to realize they represent their city.",-1
2022-11-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,1,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,"Very, very unimpressive airport",True,"  I've used this airport many times. Security staff are rude. Delta staff are rude. Immigration and customs are third-world level disorganized, at least they were last time I went through them at ATL. Airport is dirty. Restrooms are dirty. Even TSA Pre-Check and CLEAR lines are very slow due to the sheer numbers of people. International terminal really isn't befitting of one. Very, very unimpressive airport. Anyone can use the excuse that they're the busiest airport in the world, but Singapore Changi, Hong Kong, Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, Amsterdam Schiphol, Paris CDG, and even Detroit are much better examples of how busy airports are run and should be run. Heck, even other Delta hubs such as MSP, SLC or LGA would be a good starting point for ATL to learn some valuable lessons. Get your act together, ATL.",-1
2022-11-11,0.2,Business,3,3,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,no reason to be that rude and loud,False,"  Had a stressful morning which was completely my fault are forgetting my purse with all my wallets and work laptop at home. I had barely made it to the security after my Uber trip back and forth trying to get my purse. At the security check I was very nervous that I was going to miss my flight hence I was rushing and had placed my stuff in one of the containers for security checked. I place it on wrong a bucket I guess since i was in different head space but darn the lady yelled at me very rudely. She was very polite in fact was even flirting with a guy standing in front of me and her whole attitude changed when it was my turn. I understand I may have placed it on a wrong place accidentally but she had no right to yell that loud in front of everyone. I even said sorry I have a flight leaving like in 10 mins and I was trying my luck. She disregarded my apologies and proceeded to yell at me loudly second time. I was shocked , because there was no reason to be that rude and loud. Everyone at the airport was very cold and rude except the waiter at the restaurants. Everyone has a day they go though but being a little nicer would make things lot easier for everybody. TSA securities I understand you guys are tired of us but there no need to be rude somethings can be said a little nicely.",-1
2022-10-24,0.3,Business,1,2,1.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,1.0,security lines are terrible,True,"  The security lines are terrible. The TSA employees do not care. Does not matter if you have clear, pre check or digital ID. The lines are way too long. Even on a Sunday afternoon",-1
2022-10-23,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,,too busy for you,False,"  ATL airport: busiest airport in the world but too busy for you. Literally running Tom Cruise style through the airport to miss my flight by 5 minutes Security line was almost 1 hour at 6am in the morning! This is ridiculous. Best my airline would do is put me on standby and maybe get another flight or pay up. Got no help from the airport or my airline. If you fly out of ATL, be warned",-1
2022-10-22,0.1,Business,1,3,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,I despise having to come here,True,  Over an hour to retrieve bags. Always a wait at this airport. Busiest in the world and they can’t handle it. Maybe reroute some flights to more suitable airports? I despise having to come here.,-1
2022-10-08,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,I was so pleasantly surprised,True,"  
I was so pleasantly surprised by all we experienced at Atlanta going to FL and the going home to OH. The people at all Delta counters were so nice and welcoming. The restrooms were really clean and well identified. The terminal to train from T to A was immediate, clean and well directed. We then got a Dunkin Donut, coffee and ate at catCora’s kitchen. The food was very good, beautifully presented and our waiter was so nice. Thanks Atlanta!",1
2022-09-20,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,security lines are astonishingly inefficient,True,"  The busiest airport in the world could sure stand to get its act together. To its credit, the signage to access the terminals from the highways and to leave the airport were, in my opinion, ample. The majority of personnel we met in that airport, even security, were polite and professional - the only reason I'm not giving this airport a completely flunking score. That includes personnel for both Delta and Frontier Airlines. The tram connecting the terminals is clean and wonderfully efficient. Some of the Delta SkyMiles lounges are national-class, even world-class. That's where my compliments end. Now here's the bad stuff: The airport is predominantly dirty (not as dirty as Denver or Seattle, but still pretty bad). There are few places to grab a bite to eat or something to drink pre-security. The baggage and ticket counters are cramped and narrow, unbecoming of the world's busiest airport. Most departure gates are also cramped and narrow, with little seating, also unbecoming of the world's busiest airport. The security lines are astonishingly inefficient, even by US large airport standards; using CLEAR and Pre-Check in tandem should take five minutes, even on a busy holiday or weekend - not 25+ minutes like it did. If you don't have an expedited security clearance like CLEAR or Pre-Check and have to wait in the normal line, 90+ minutes to get through security on the busiest of days isn't unheard of. Again, to security's credit, the TSA officers I met were nice enough, but there clearly aren't enough TSA officers staffed at ATL. And, to the credit of the thousands and thousands of passengers being herded like cattle, people behaved relatively orderly and politely. But thousands and thousands of passengers hourly shouldn't be beholden to the whims of government incompetence - which, like I've said, is unbecoming of the world's busiest airport.",-1
2022-09-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,4,4,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,why do they provide lousy service to their guests on later flights?,True," In coming home from visiting Colorado Springs, I arrived at Atlanta airport around 1.40am and the train that you take at the gates to get to baggage claim and ground transportation was operating on a “limited schedule.” Meaning you could wait to see when and if it would come to pick you up or walk. I was exhausted, like everyone else but we all chose to walk. Based on my activity tracker, we walked about a mile! This is not the first time this happened arriving in Atlanta late. If planes are still landing at 1.50am, why is the train not operating on the normal schedule? Atlanta airport boasts beefing the busiest and most efficient airport, why do they provide lousy service to their guests on later flights? So beware of the long walk if you arrive past their normal train running schedule!!",1
2022-09-01,0.5,Family Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,yelled at by a cleaning person,False,"  My wife and I found the cleaning staff, in particular late night arrival and early morning departure, were very rude and inpatient. We were yelled at on two occasions by the staff cleaning the floors near the plane train area because we were not directed by signs or staff which side of the cones we should be standing while waiting for the train. Again today, as I was arriving for an early morning flight, I was again yelled at by a cleaning person for being on the wrong side of her cones. There were no signs or persons available to direct foot traffic as to where to walk or not walk, just a red tape down the middle of the isle. Not a very good impression to greet guests arriving to such a busy airport.",1
2022-08-22,0.2,Business,4,2,2.0,4.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,There’s no customer service anymore,False,"  I grew up with the Atlanta airport beginning and transforming. However, I am so disappointed at what it has become. The bathrooms are too small and dirty, the electrical outlets for phone charging do not work, and the attendants belong in another setting. There’s no customer service anymore. I don’t care what the pandemic has brought to America, hire people who still have integrity to get the job done",-1
2022-08-06,0.5,Solo Leisure,3,4,,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,continually inept at their job,False,"  On August 20, I arrived from CDG to Atlanta on Delta 8606 Terminal 1 at 5.05 having a correspondence on Delta flight 1249 at 7.55pm to Tampa. The walk from Terminal 1 at one end of the airport to Gate A02 at the other en of the airport was for me a nightmare. No cart to be found, a 20 minute walk with luggage, no other form of transportation, barely a few escalators, up and down, up again and down again to get to a train, from the train another walk. I am 75 years of age and very fit yet I was thoroughly exhausted. I had already been through 2 customs when I arrived at the one in Atlanta to board my final flight, I had with me a few purchases bought at the Duty free airport in Paris. I had a mid size bottle of liquor which the custom agent insisted had to be put in my suitcase and my suitcase checked since apparently the duty free had forgotten to wrap it in a special plastic wrapper. Even though I had a receipt form the Duty free and a gift bag, the agent in no way educated enough to comprehend the difference, sent me back to the delta counter to open my suitcase, pack the bottle and register the suitcase. Thankfully I was lucky enough to find a gentleman at the Delta check-in who assisted me and was very kind. Admittedly from a few comments heard, I was not the first victim of the lack of understanding by the customs agents. One might say they are applying the rules, however is it applying the rules or is it enforcing the little power they have to unnecessarily harass travelers -  it is my understanding that they are continually inept at their job and take extreme pleasure in adding unpleasant and totally unnecessary steps to an already tired passenger? So between this and the lack of assistance for passengers to get from one point to the other in an immense airport, I will avoid that airport at all costs.",-1
2022-08-05,0.3,Business,1,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,distressed by many things at the airport,True,"  I am distressed by many things at the airport today. The Clear and Pre Check lines are about a 30 min delay. It is hard to justify paying for these services if the line is so long. When I see supervisors at the elevated podium, I wonder why they cannot jump in to help out. When I worked, even as a manager, if we were busy I stepped in to help out. Many standing around, few working. Not all screening machines/lines are open. The food service lines are also really long. 20 min to get a cup of coffee? Why not add automated lines that deliver regular coffee to the customer? 20 min to order and deliver food to me at lunch. Again, offer more grab and go if you lack staff. The Saladworks stand is closed, as usual. One employee could sell the grab/go salads and ring up! Automate the purchase of salads like La Madeline has done. Many food vendors are still not open. Please find a way to sell pre boxed salads and sandwiches if workers are in short supply. I am happy to eat a cold salad or sandwich, hummus plate etc. Restrooms are dirty. Lots of cleaning people with their carts standing around, but they seem to be busy looking at their phones, or visiting with each other, and not cleaning. Loud music in food court at Concourse C is ridiculous. It is so loud that no one can talk, or answer phone calls from customers. Turn it down. Easy fix!",-1
2022-08-03,0.1,Business,3,1,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,The airport seems to having taken a downhill turn,True," The airport seems to having taken a downhill turn as it relates to cleanliness and customer service. I feel like I’m encroaching upon peoples personal homes and spaces as I attempt to make purchases from concourse eateries (i.e. Crepes, Caribou, and Boars Head) all on concourse A. Staff seem to be plentiful but the customer service is often rude, unprofessional, and vulgar). At crepes while waiting to get my order the young lady was having a personal conversation on her phone about a side job making food. She used the “n” word often and several other vulgar words. All while waiting on me. The young ladies at Boars Head were nice but very immature. I paid $4 for a drink I ended up tossing in the trash. Speaking of trash the concourse seating area is trashy and unkept. I see cleaning carts with staff but are sitting, congregating, and on their phones. I feel like I’m in someone’s backyard uninvited. At Caribou staff appear to be disgruntled and for $6 a pop you don’t expect for them to be out of whipped cream since all pictures are featured with WC. Unfortunately, the entertainment is as trashy as the concourse. ReachTv is playing on all TVs. The profanity is used throughout the Espinosa of “magherita”. Children and adults are throughout the concourse being force to hear/see this. Surprised me that this is an international airport. If I had another choice I would take it for future travel.",-1

You think with it being the busiest airport in the world they would be welcoming or helpful. Absolutely not. Everyone here rolls their eyes, gives attitude and seems to hate their job. I don’t care what time it is, you chose to do this job. I hate coming to this airport. It is not efficient at all like the mayor voice over states. It’s a joke.

Concourse A, food seating area had so much food under the tables and the tiles had layers of grime on them. Tables had not been wiped off, gross. Concourse D gates waiting area had crusted food on the seats (old and new food); the floor did not look like it had been vacuumed in who knows when; the window and seal had dirt, food, grime splattered every where.",-1

On our return trip through Atlanta, traveling to Orlando, we were delayed by Delta again, waiting for a flight attendant. On both our delayed layovers we experienced extremely unpleasant attitudes by both airline personnel and employees of retail establishments. Any ""Welcome to Atlanta"" signs should be taken down and destroyed. There is no welcoming in Atlanta Hartsfield Airport. We will avoid this airport at all cost.",-1

Why is the car hire only at domestic - adds an hour to an international journey. The food options at international are terrible. Tonight 9pm 26th May, most food options have run low. We are travelling business - Club ATL is a joke. No space to sit, a few chips to eat. This is one of the worst international terminals I have ever flown. And someone tells me it’s new? What a joke. Just avoid if at all possible.",-1
2022-05-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,airport is dark and dingy,True,"  The airport is dark and dingy, not clean and a nightmare to get around. This has been obvious for several years. However, their staff is even worse! I arrived from an international flight and had to wait in line for TSA clearance to get to my connecting flight. While waiting, a female airport employee responsible for assisting elderly international passengers in wheelchairs, literally was being abusive without any intervention from other employees or TSA. The passengers had been put in a side area for a while before she came in and started shouting in Spanish words to them. She didn't speak the language, only was able to shout certain words at them, and then starting cursing as she pulled them into the queue for TSA check. While getting their belongings for the TSA clearance, she was ripping things off of them (shawls, bags, hats etc.) and when one lady tried to hand her shoes for the bin, she moved aside and let them fall to the ground. Her behavior was irresponsible at best. Negligent and abusive to be accurate. She had no right to behave this way.",-1
2022-05-17,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,3,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,international terminal at ATL is an absolute embarrassment,False,"  The international terminal at ATL is an absolute embarrassment. Back in the 1990s ATL was a slick and efficient modern airport with decent facilities and efficient ground transportation. The international terminal was inadequate from new and has never been improved. 15 minute bus ride from the rental car centre is just the start of the problems. Chaotic check-in zone, unnecessary delays for security, poor food selection, poor seating. The whole thing falls a long way below modern standards. Avoid if possible.",-1
2022-05-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,4,4,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,the food selection could do better!,True,"  Good: I didn’t experience rude staff as many mentioned. I got through security quickly and everyone was fine: brisk and not overly friendly, but doing their job. Bad: Surely whoever sells the food selection could do better. One place for coffee (Starbucks) with a 50-60 person lineup. No-where else to buy coffee at 8 in the morning. One choice in breakfast food, except they didn’t have many of the choices. Otherwise there is a Chinese food place and a hamburger/hotdog place. There was one place behind bars that might open later and a sit-down restaurant, also closed, so who knows. Overall, if you have a longer connection time or your flight is delayed, fingers cross that you are not stuck in Altanta Int’l concourse.",-1
2022-05-07,0.1,Business,1,1,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,the place is hopeless,False,"  Words almost fail me. I was transiting Atlanta on my way back to the UK from Jamaica. My duty free bottle of rum ($70 worth), sealed in a globally recognized bona-fide plastic bag, was singled out for an X-ray which it ""failed"". I was told to go back to the other side of security to check the bottle into hold baggage, despite my protestations that (a) it would likely get broken and (b) I therefore have to go through the whole security process again. I was then sent back to the Virgin check in desk since Delta could not process this action. Suffice to say the Virgin check in desk was not yet open. So two hours of my life wasted because the TSA X-ray machine cannot distinguish between high quality booze and something more dangerous. I still cannot decide whether this is just vindictiveness or utterly useless technology/staff. Avoid at all cost, the place is hopeless and the staff are rude beyond description.",-1
2022-04-07,0.3,Couple Leisure,2,2,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Disaster airport,True," My husband who is a regular customer of Delta and always flies the route SJO-ATL-SYR bought this expensive comfort class ticket hoping we will have a good experience. Arrived from San Jose, Costa Rica on time but had to sit in the plane for an extra 40 min because there was nobody to park the plane at the gate according to the pilot’s announcement. As a globetrotter I had never heard of such thing especially when Atlanta boasts the busiest airport and most efficient one in the world! Preposterous! My husband had requested a wheelchair on arrival and assistance. To our dismay there were no attendants at the gate. We waited until all passengers had left the sleeve and I ended up pushing the w/c through customs. We both have respiratory conditions and he has knee surgeries. The next flight to SYR was delayed, We boarded eventually and after another hour of sitting in the plane ready for take off, the pilot announced that due to storm and the crews expired time, passengers have to leave aircraft and go back to concourse A, which involves distance and riding the train. The line at the customer service was so long that it took 5 hours or 1am till 5am to finally be rebooked. Disaster airport and only three ticket agents working! As a former travel agent and world traveler, would recommend more employees and better customer service.",-1

2022-03-04,0.3,Business,1,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,As everyone has repeated they are rude,True," As everyone has repeated they are rude, and give unnecessarily contradictory and complicated instructions. For example, at the check in 3/4 at 6.50 am I was told to walk forward and simultaneously push my items through on a backed up overflowing conveyor belt. I asked the female agent to clarify which she wants me to do she tells me to push my items forward. How on an overflowing conveyor belt as you are also yelling at me to go through the metal detector? Her response was a condescending “make it make sense” as if the passengers were too stupid to understand. Atlanta and Miami are always the worse with Atlanta far exceeding Miami. I know it won’t get better because this is how it’s been. I wish TSA would improve its hiring and training.",-1
2022-02-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,4,4,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,What an embarrassment,True,"  What an embarrassment for a supposedly premier international airport. 2 TSA agents essentially unmasked (masks under chin) despite federal mandate, TSA agents extremely rude and aggressive. All food options closed by 8pm. Really - does the person responsible for running this place really not have a clue how poorly run and embarrassing this airport is?",-1

Every single restaurant and food place in the F terminal (where I believe all international flights happen) were closed. Every single one. We were gobsmacked. Upon our return home, we had another connection through ATL. Customs line was horrifically long and the security lines to our connecting flight were awful. Our first flight was delayed, but despite that, we still had two hours to get to our connecting flight, and we still missed it. Complete disorganization and mayhem. Spent the night in Atlanta.",-1
2022-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Embarrassing that this is a premier airport,False,  Arrived on KLM/Delta from Amsterdam. The transition from the international to domestic terminals is awful and confusing with only rude help available at the scene. What were the designers thinking with whether no or confusing signage and a mostly unmarked maize to get from baggage recheck from Intl to domestic gates. Embarrassing that this is a premier airport. Very sad. Will avoid in the future.,-1
2021-12-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,1,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"Food, and trash on chairs and floor",False,"  Disgusting. I got stuck over night on 12/26/21. The area for my Delta flight was disgusting. Food, and trash on chairs and floor. It was obvious it was not being cleaned let alone sanitized, four days later and I’m in line for a Covid test. Thanks!",-1
2021-12-28,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,4,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,The experience was disgraceful,True," Aggressive, rude TSAs. My sister has sleep apnoea, to breathe at night, she must carry a CPAP machine. She has asthma, she needs a special inhaler. Her bag was pulled aside not once, nor twice, her bag was detained 'three times'. The TSA agents opened her bag, removed the CPAP machine, and failed to recognize the secondary inhaler machine as another appliance that needed to be scanned separately. Unprofessional and a waste of time. My sister was glared at, accused of being difficult, and treated with such distain and rudeness that her anxiety (for which she is on medication) spiked. Badly. It has been several hours since then, and she is still near tears when she describes her experience. An agent held his hand up in her face to cut her off when she tried to speak to him, and was spoken to both sharply and aggressively when she tried to cooperate. On top of all that, when her bags were thrown in bins to be rescanned, her brand-new neck pillow was jostled loose. Additionally, there was a forgotten black-and-red laptop that sat where it was for over 10 minutes. My sister's medical equipment got scanned three times, but nobody noticed an abandoned device for almost a quarter of an hour? Is this negligence or ignorance? The experience was disgraceful. Unprofessional is too kind a description for the treatment my sister endured.",-1
2021-12-26,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,4,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,airport is genuinely insufferable,False," This airport is genuinely insufferable. If you book a flight at 6, you might as well be prepared to leave at 10 and sit in a chair for hours. I am a frequent flyer here and I have never once had a flight that didn't have a major screw-up or set back. One would assume operating an airport would constitute having functional facilities and airplanes but Atlanta Hartsfield does things differently. I almost never write reviews for anything but Hartsfield has burnt me so many times that I felt like warning anyone curious. I'm nauseated with paying hundreds of dollars to leave at a specified time and quite literally never once having my end of the deal held up. If you have options, weigh them well.",-1
2021-12-08,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,there were very few people working,False,"  Arrived from the UK on 2nd December. Despite there only being less than a hundred people or so in the queue it took over an hour to get through passport control as there were very few people working. Only one kiosk was going through passengers with special assistance/in wheelchairs and as such there was a queue of over ten people in wheelchairs waiting, I hope none of them became unwell during this time. On our return we were very surprised that in F/international terminal all food outlets closed at 7pm, considering most flights heading East depart later in the evening and at night time this hardly makes a lot of sense. This information isn't even on the website so we couldn't prepare and eat in advance.",-1
2021-12-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,3,2.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,I have never had such a poor experience at an airport,False,"  The airport is very chaotic beginning with my son having to let me out in the middle of the street due to no traffic directing for departure. I have been flying Delta and a skymiles member preferring Delta due to their quality customer service until I had the most rude and disrespectful Delta agent at the luggage check in. She was very impatient barking orders for me to scan my boarding pass and not giving me time to comply before barking another order what's my name she was so impatient. I have severe arthritis and it takes me awhile to use my hands due to stiffness and lost of feeling in my fingers. I handed her my ID as the scanner did not appear to be working. She was sucking her teeth and rolling her eyes it was so uncomfortable dealing with her attitude. I ask could I check my other bag if the flight was full instead of at the gate again due to disability of having to take bags to the gate. She then saw I had my 4 lbs yorkie in her carrier and stated is that an animal. I told her yes she is a dog, I was accused of trying to sneak the dog past her. She would not allow me talk at all. I finally asked for another agent to assist me while she continued to speak to me defensively. Finally another agent come over and took care of me while she continued to fuss in front of him. I asked her please stop speaking to me you are very rude and unprofessional. She threatened to not let me on the flight. I asked why because your being rude I have never had such a poor experience at an airport. I paid the pet fee and thanked the gentleman for helping me. He was very professional. Once I went through security with my pet. The agent that tested my hands was rude and yelled at me because I set my dog down on the counter to prevent from dropping her as he asked for my other hand. Yelled at me to don't put the dog on the counter as if she had rabies. She is a 4lb yorkie. I said sorry please don't yell at me I'm trying not to drop my dog. He was very rough with swabbing my hand and dismissive. I rarely write reviews but I have to let Atlanta know you need to do better. Not coming back through anytime soon. I will also be making complaint to Delta regarding treatment of passengers with disabilities need extra time to preform request. Different airports have different requirements so more signage directions should be visible.",-1
2021-12-01,0.1,Business,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,No one was accountable,True,"  My Son and I had a 4 hour layover, found our gate and parked it right there. We spent much of the 4 hours chatting with the ""nice"" lady behind the counter and when it came close to the time we thought we should get a seat assignment to Charleston, she stated she needed to board a flight to PA and then she would get us our seat assignments. She boarded the first flight and then left. Another agent came up and we asked him if we could get the seat assignment and he stated that the gate changed 15 minutes prior. We ran to the gate (which was about 4 up from where we were) and they closed the doors and we ""missed"" the flight. We then needed to find another flight but I was hot. No one was accountable just repeatedly stating that we need to watch the monitors as it was our responsibility. Yes. I 100% agree if I hadn't been in almost constant communication with the lady who stated she would be the one to help. Everyone I talked to was rude and lacked any kind of empathy or accountability. If one more person stated that ""We change gates all the time, you need to watch the monitors"" I thought my head would explode. Whatever happened to common courtesy, or better yet, common sense? Why would I stare at a screen if the lady behind the desk stated she was the one to check us in? We lost an entire day of work and the expense was huge. Thank goodness for that free drink voucher.",-1
2021-11-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,3,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,The lines were very very long,True," What happened to this airport? I used to rave about this before, being one of my most favorites in the world. I travel extensively and I always prefer ATL as my port of entry. But I think after the bad experience I had today, I will be looking for another POE. The Immigration had a very long line. But I breezed through that line in less than 10 minutes. Luggage claim and rechecked no problem. After recheck, passengers were about to go through security when we were all redirected to the TSA line upstairs. This was where the mess all started. The lines were very very long, and were hardly moving. There were a few times when the lines just stopped. The smart move would have been to open more metal detectors to get the lines moving, instead the TSA officers were just standing around. They only had three conveyors/detectors opened. Why? This airport was so much better than this. Today was a major disappointment. As a result, I missed my connecting flight to Orlando. And vowed to never fly into this airport again if I could help it.",-1
2021-10-18,0.8,Business,5,4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,Worst lost and found experience I ever had,True," Worst lost and found experience I ever had, my phone tracker said the phone was in the lost and found and they are saying they cant find it. Also second lost and found but no way of contacting them or to go about reporting my item lost, I was just told to check the other one, why have two separate lost and founds in one airport with separate numbers and ways of reporting. They don't talk to each other and when you report it the site doesn't tell you which lost and found to contact.",-1
2021-10-10,0.2,Business,5,3,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,hope many others boycott the vendors,True,  Most vendors no longer accept cash in this airport. Debit or credit card or no food or drink. How discriminating - some people including kids do not have a card. What happened to the dollar being legal tender? I will not buy anything in this airport! I hope many others boycott the vendors so they can go out of business.,-1
2021-10-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,watched all aspects of the airport decline,True,"  I’ve traveled in and out of the ATL airport for the past 30 years and have watched all aspects of the airport decline. It appears that airport leadership is asleep on the job. Airport Parking is typically unavailable, construction seems to be never ending, flow of people inside & outside is mired in chaos, security is inept, food venues are sketchy and to top it all off - the unprofessional customer service attitudes reflects a growing personnel issue that seems to indicate poor training, poor work ethic, and a bizarre entitlement mentality. If you have a choice - find yourself a different airport - even if it means more connections. If leadership is actually reading my very modest review, pleaase turn this airport around and stop its death spiral.",-1

2021-09-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad,True," Currently holding a temporary residence here at Robins AFB, Georgia. My father drove my car down so that I would have transport to leave base, however, we wanted to fly him back home. I flew in to Atlanta and had just a few issues with my arrival into this airport so I figured it wouldn’t be awful if I booked a flight for my father to fly out of there. I cannot begin to describe how awful the experience was for my dad and I. The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad who is easily confused and older, acted as if he had COVID or was diseased. The TSA agent literally looked as if she was about to draw a weapon on my dad because he was six feet away from her? Additionally the representative at the Delta check-in desk who is posted there to help guests pre-check for their tickets was also so awfully rude. Asked again, another simple question and she acted as if we were burden to ask her anything instead of just letting her stand there and ruin her uneventful day. Normally at my hometown airport, they usually let my dad come into the terminal with me to say goodbye as any day I could get orders to deploy and won’t have a chance to say goodbye before I go. But at this airport, I felt as though they were snatching him away from me and I was afraid he wasn’t going to make his flight because it is an extremely large airport and he is older and just overwhelmed easily. Thankfully and barely, he made it to his gate. He then told me that he was just extremely disappointed because the associates at the counter by the terminal were rude over the intercom every time they used it and just rude to other guests that went up to the counter. It made him so uncomfortable with the entire experience that he never wants to fly out of the airport again and would love it if I never did either. It made him so upset that he ended up crying part of his flight home. He’s concerned that somethings going to happen to me on deployment and he would’ve never gotten to have said goodbye. Simple things like this go a long way for paying customers. Having this experience, I think I will follow my dads advice and fly out from Savannah or another airport the next chance I actually get to fly home.",-1
2021-09-20,0.8,Couple Leisure,3,4,,5.0,0.0,,,3.0,be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing,False,"  Arrived Atlanta from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Be prepared for a long walk from the gate to Passport Control. The line to have your passport checked was long and took approximately 90 minutes. However, the line moved relatively fast considering there were at least 500 to 1,000 passengers waiting to be processed. I would say it was fairly well organized as they had people directing passengers to the booths. Not a bad experience. Just be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing. Here is my major complaint about this airport if you are arriving on an international flight. If your final destination is Atlanta and you wish to catch a ride share, MARTA or a hotel van, passengers are required to ride a small shuttle bus to Ground Transportation which takes 20 minutes. We had two heavy suitcases which had to be lifted into the bus. As we are over 65, it was difficult. Getting passengers from the international terminal to ground transportation in the main terminal is very inefficient and inconvenient.",1
2021-09-17,0.7,Solo Leisure,5,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,,There were no shortages of shopping or eating options,True, Transferred through ATL on 9/06/2021. This place is immense! There were no shortages of shopping or eating options. There were plenty of seats at the gates. The announcements were timely and clear. Lots of monitors around to check where your flight is departing from.The restrooms were reasonably clean. The train that runs between concourses is extremely handy as well. Can't comment on anything curbside as I was only transiting through.,1
2021-09-13,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,5,1.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,,What are the people that run ATL thinking?,False,"  At about dinner time on a Sunday in Terminal C, about half of the eateries were closed! Trying to get something to eat just added more stress to an inherently stressful situation. What are the people that run ATL thinking? I guess they're thinking they have no competition, which is more-or-less true. I hate ATL.",-1
2021-09-06,0.4,Business,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,"there is just no reason to blast the concourse with loud, undesirable sound",True," For some reason, the airport has elected to play silly TV shows that no one is watching playing on a few screens at an incredibly loud level, like in a movie theater. Quiet is preferable and there is just no reason to blast the concourse with loud, undesirable sound that otherwise causes one to reach for earplugs or noise reduction headsets. Perhaps if the same loud obnoxious noise was pumped into the airport management offices there would be a change. There is no purpose to this noise pollution. Stop the insanity.",1
2021-08-31,0.2,Business,4,1,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Security was a nightmare,False,  We were trying to evacuate Hurricane Ida. We had a group of 40 people. We were finally able to get a bus to take us to Atlanta. With the long traffic we were on the bus for 14 hours with no sleep. Arrived 4am to the airport. Security was a nightmare. Not because it was backed up but mostly because it was very confusing. Especially on 20 hours with no sleep. The woman at the security area where we were putting our things on the conveyor was literally screaming at me. I was confused and tired as she continued to scream and belittle me. Had she just explained calmly I would have understood what she was saying. Once I got through my feet were filthy with dirt and crud all over the floor. I had 3 elderly people in our group in wheelchairs. 2 of them were helped to the gate by employees. We still had one with us. Getting on the Tram was tricky. The Tram throws you around so badly that we were trying to hold the chair and ourselves. A lady had her baby trying to get her in a stroller. The baby didn't want in the stroller so she was trying to hold her and the stroller as it was rolling around. I grabbed the stroller as she tried to hold on to the baby. We found our gate around 6 am. There are many restaurants in the airport but none of them open. Once a Dunkin Donuts opened the line was all the way down the corridor.,-1
2021-08-29,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,3,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,security checkpoint is dysfunctional,False,"  This airport has the most unhelpful, disrespectful TSA of any I have ever been to. The security checkpoint is dysfunctional compared to other airports. They have a lot of work to do for being one of the busiest airports in the nation. Traffic is always bad.",-1
2021-08-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,4.0,this is one of the worst I’ve come across,True," For a large airport, this is one of the worst I’ve come across. The gates are filthy, the information is lacking, and the online resources are lacking. We had a four hour layover so had plenty of time to find amenities, but had to search for a map or info. The one bright spot was a meal at One Flew South, a unique menu well prepared, but we barely got there before their kitchen closed at 6.30 pm. The public WiFi is pathetic. While writing this review, sitting in terminal D, I have had to reconnect a half-dozen times. And there are no visible charging stations. Another problem here is the attitude of public who are evidently, we were told, protesting having to wear masks in the airport. Can’t tell you how many people — including flight crew members — we saw walking the terminals with their masks under their noses or completely off. This may be something common in the area, but since mask wearing is a requirement of all airports — and other airports have signage about how to wear a mask — it would seem there is something Atlanta Hartsfield could make a better effort to keep their passengers safe. Clean it up, Atlanta!",-1
2021-08-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,1,1.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,2.0,One of dirtiest Airports I have ever seen,False,  One of dirtiest Airports I have ever seen. It looks like it's been weeks since the last time it was vacuumed. Restrooms are dirty. Dirty seats. The restaurant we ate in had torn seats. The Delta customer service we talked to looked annoyed that we were there. No charging stations in a lot of seats.,-1

2021-07-26,0.4,Solo Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,,,This airport is badly designed,True," This is probably the worst airport I have been through. And I once worked at JFK with its many terminals. I had to transit through this airport from Costa Rica to catch a domestic flight to JFK NYC. There are no restrooms in the immediate area. The plane I came off had one aisle. And the flight attendants spent a good deal of time using the aisle to serve snacks. So it's not always convenient to use the restroom on the aircraft. Common sense you would think they would place restrooms near where the gate is where we got off the plane. Then it's not like you can just walk to the CBP area. We had to stand there for as much as 15 minutes and more at least twice before being allowed to proceed to the long line to present our passports. Walking from the gate to the CBP seems like 1/4 of a mile. There were hundreds of people on the line. There is a restroom in that area but with such a long line and a connecting flight less than two hours of my arrival I did not want to chance using it then getting on line. The saving grace was that the customs officer did not take long with my passport. He basically looked at my photo, asked me to remove my mask then asked me if I am who it says I am. Then I was on my way. It took over one hour to exit the CBP line. Someone took my luggage and put it on the belt to be sent to my JFK NYC flight. As soon as we walked out of that area we all had to go through security as if we had just walked off the street. I overheard one of the TSA agents telling someone that until you reach age 75 you have to remove your shoes. Well around where I live I see people who could barely get on the bus without the driver lowering the stairs. And many of these people are not even 50 years old. After going through security I checked the board but could not find my flight listed. I asked a lady at information desk. She told me I had to take the shuttle train on the right hand side one stop to area E. And go to E11. I went to E11. No such flight. I went to the Delta counter I saw when I came to area E. The lady told me I had to go to E 31 and the flight is about to leave so I had to hurry. I was the last person to get on the plane when I heard them say they were about to close the door. A gate agent came with me. She said there was no more room for my carry-on so I had to check it but not before I removed my laptop and camera which most likely would be stolen. My advice is avoid this airport if you're connecting from an international flight. Connecting domestic to international was not an issue when I was leaving. Unless you got four hours between international arrival and your departure connection don't risk it. And putting a restroom all the way in the customs area serves no purpose because most people need to use the restroom as soon as they exit the plane. This airport is badly designed. When I was leaving for Costa Rica I arrived after 8 am on a weekday morning and none of the restaurants were open. Not even a place to serve coffee. It's as if the airport was designed for the convenience of airport staff and not its passengers!",-1

The few places that were open had line 30-40 people deep. At 10.40 am there was a place that made breakfast wraps but they weren’t open until 11.00 am?? But yet there was a pizza place that was open. Makes no sense. Literally in the concourse we were in there were only 4 out of 15 restaurants open and ready to serve at 10:40. The food service options are not worth a hoot.,-1

Restrooms were disgusting (every stall was unflushed/dirty), 1/3 of the restaurants/snack providers closed, long lines to get into the ones that are open, 10 deep line to check out at a magazine/candy store, wifi doesn't work at all, NONE of the plugs at the seats work, about 1/2 of the ones on the walls work and the tram to get to/from the main area was so crowded you couldn't breathe. I got off ASAP and walked from C to baggage. I fly regularly for work. This is the worst I have experienced. It has not always been this bad.",-1

We have only flown about 2 times in the last 10 years. The TSA agents just kept yelling at us. I asked them what to do and they just kept screaming the same things over and over, then stated ""its been this way for 90 years, whats wrong with you"" I was not familiar with removing my ipad from the case, they just stood there and screamed. They wouldnt let anyone help my husband stand up they just kept screaming at us. I have never been treated so badly, the TSA agents were like a wild band of gangsters. I will never fly out of this  airport again.",-1

On terminal F on departure. On return today there were no restaurants except Burger King open in the terminal so I did t have anything to eat waiting on shuttle to Athens z, Ga. also, I arrived in International. Immigration and customs took 2 minutes. Luggage more Than 45. Waiting for the shuttle to the domestic terminal made me miss shuttle to Athens. And there were 45 people waiting for about 20 seats. I have no idea what the others did. They were told a shuttle would come again in a half hour. The Atlanta Airport is a mess. All international airports I went through on my travel were operational and efficient. Atlanta airport sucks. Maybe it should be taken over by the state. Avoid it if you can.",-1

2021-05-21,0.2,Business,3,3,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,there are 8 restaurants in the food court and only 1 is open,True," I travel through this airport a minimum of 4-times a month. On my return trips I typically arrive around 6.30 to 6.45 pm. Almost all restaurants are closed. It's the strangest thing. This is not an occasional situation. It's every evening visit. Who is managing this airport? Why is this the case? After talking to employees at the information center, I've found out the restaurants close at 4:00 +/-. Now there's a couple of the larger restaurants open like TGI Fridays open, but most people w/ connectors don't have that much time. Currently, I'm in E terminal and there are 8 restaurants in the food court and only 1 is open [McDonald's]. Now there like a 100 people in line so that's not an option. All but (2) of the he convenience stores are closed and those have huge lines. The restaurant services should be for the peoples convenience and not the restaurant's convenience. Why hasn't the management observed this and made adjustments? I don't think they should stay open all night, but this is a little ridiculous. I'm sure they will blame this on COVID, but this has been going on long before COVID (I've been traveling through here for years). My guess it has a little to do with the controlling power of the political power of the mayor and her cronies.",-1
2021-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,TSA is an absolute joke,False,  Arrived at the airport more than 2 hours early and the flight had to be held so my wife and I could sprint through the airport to make out flight. This is because TSA is an absolute joke. It took more than 2 hours to get through the line with is absolutely unacceptable. I have flown into countless airports domestically and internationally and never had such an awful experience. I absolutely will never fly into or out of this airport again and I strongly suggest that no one else does either. I will gladly pay more money to fly in and out of a smaller airport. Atlanta’s international airport’s TSA division needs a total overhaul if they ever want to give individuals a positive flying experience.,-1
2021-05-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,1,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,the most unorganized airport I’ve ever been to,False,"  This is the most unorganized airport I’ve ever been to. They had us going every which way, but the right way. It all started getting off an international flight where we had to walk half way across the airport. Then after going through the gauntlet of passport control then I stepped in a room of mass hysteria to get my luggage, then drop it off. Then I was directed to go upstairs to check in for my connecting flight, only to be told they don’t have TSA precheck. After going through the security check then I had to go back downstairs to catch a train to go to my terminal which was filthy. The only light to this was the handsome CBP security officer who stopped to check my passport. He was the highlight of me coming back from Puerto Vallarta! This airport needs to do better. It was a complete disaster!",-1

It was my first ever transit/visit via US, so I cannot compare to other US cities. However, having traveled a lot for over 20 years, it is appalling. There is hardly anything to eat, other than McDonald's at Terminal D, so I had to go to Terminal A. Well, the prices are mad, you pay 5.99+tax for a cup of coffee and 10.99+tax for a chicken salad. I asked them for any oil or sour cream or anything for my salad but they only have mayonnaise or mustard or ranch sauce. They DO NOT understand the concept of food allergies. If you have any kind of allergy or intolerance, do not go to this airport. Other notes - very crowded and noisy, you cannot get anywhere to rest quietly. I am giving it 2 rather than 1 because it's relatively clean. Avoid at any length of you can!",-1

For some reason, they use their jobs as an excuse to abuse any power they think they may have and make you feel like an idiot. It is not okay to bark at people in a disrespectful manner. The screener at The North Terminal that just stands there and motions for you to go in yelled at me for putting my boarding pass in my back pocket (which I have done 100% of the time on my many travels with not one issue). If this is a problem for him, he needs to learn to ask nicely, I am not below him in any capacity and will not be treated this way. Atlanta: Get your employees in line!",-1

One lady was on the curb and got a whole yellow cloud to the face, and the little girl working at the shuttle post was doused in pollen and debris from the road! Everything on the sidewalk was covered in pollen and leaves, etc.. and the girl working there had to go get the lady and ask her to reblow it all back off of the sidewalk! She then had to rewipe everything at her station. How very unprofessional! Can this not be a task that's completed earlier in the morning when less people are on the curbs?",-1

I counted two outlets that worked in D terminal for everyone to charge their phones. They have removed all books from the gift shops that are open. Food vendors that are open were rude. Bathrooms were dirty even when there was an attendant in them. Areas felt like the AC wasn’t working. While they have blocked seats in the hold areas, it’s just resulted in loads of people standing in the isle. ATL was always “decent” to fly through. But the decent apparently doesn’t apply during a pandemic.",-1

They treat you like you are a complete idiot who is deliberately annoying them. They make up the rules as they go along, and shout out orders to befuddled travelers. If you fail to understand their mumbling, or the process known only to them, they treat you like a criminal. I have TSA pre-clearance, but conveniently they had shut down the TSA Line and wordlessly passed me a card. I was supposed to have held onto it until I went through the scanner myself. What would be so hard about posting the process on a whiteboard for all of us to read. By the way, my job is training workers at large corporations.

Worse - many seat sections 'look' like they have outlets under the seats to recharge - but then the power to the seats is not on! Literally - all through the length of Terminal D there are dozens of pre-fab seats, and the cord that would normally attach to a wall outlet is just sitting there, unattached, lying on the floor. So - the many outlets placed under the seats are rendered useless. C’mon Atlanta. We travelers don’t ask for much. A couple of food options, a place to sit, and a place to recharge our phones. It’s how we use our time - by doing work on our laptops, staying in touch with loved ones as we travel, and entertaining ourselves with what for many is a few moments to ourselves. We even bring our own equipment - we just need access to outlets. I think we pay a tax to travel through - right? Please fix this big oversight. (Shout out to the sections between terminals, if one chooses to walk. Beautiful and informative displays! But - hard to remember when I couldn’t charge my phone).",-1
2021-02-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,3,,5.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,This behavior is unprofessional,False,"  Airport employees have absolutely no respect for travelers. They sit in the gate areas with their cell phones on loud volume playing inappropriate music and videos as if the travelers are not customers. I sat and watched an employee approach Gate D3 where there were restless travelers who looked to be exhausted. The employee sat directly behind them and commenced on playing loud videos that included abrasive language and music. I was totally shocked! Shortly thereafter, another employee with a ABM uniform (Who had just finished cleaning the DS4-2-E1) Women's Bathroom who worked for housekeeping found her way over with a bag of chips and a sprite to have a lengthy conversation on her cellphone on loud speaker. After she got off the phone she had the audacity to burp out loud! Disgusting! Low and behold as I look up and ahead there is another employee with a PrimeFlight uniform on pushing a empty wheelchair eating yet another bag of snacks! All of this activity took place between 9am and 10am. This behavior is unprofessional. No wonder people look at us as ignorant unprofessional selfish individuals.

I traveled today and in perfect ATL form I had the absolute misfortune of dealing with the rudest person at the security check point. I’d like to tell you this is the first time, but it’s not. Why are these airport workers so disgustingly rude? Why is everyone ok with this? There are plenty of other busy airports that have respectful employees. When travel has declined so much due to COVID can you all really afford to allow this behavior? These employees take advantage of travelers just because!

I left food in my suitcase in error and what they put me through was horrible. The screaming in your face during Covid, lack of social distancing at all. The women TSA agents were the worst.

We will not be flying because no one is policing the masks requirements! Airlines can only police in their aircrafts. I saw several w/o masks in the train and many more at the boarding gate. They would sit with their backs to the gate agents (who do not have any power, except on their planes)! I saw many of the gate cargo workers from DGS at the food court, with no masks sitting talking on their phones. The Chiropractor on concourse A didn't even have a mask on and when I asked her where was her mask, she cut me a look! So many people, if they had a mask, had it below their nose.

My husband and I decided to grab lunch from Subway in terminal T today while waiting for our plane to board. The two ladies working behind the counter (both making our sandwiches as well as the cashier) were unbelievably rude. We could have purchased our lunches from another establishment, but decided on Subway. These ladies weren’t doing us any favors, they acted as if we were bothering them. Excuse me! Never again will I purchase anything from this establishment while traveling through the Atlanta airport. In addition, almost all the employees at this airport are rude! If you do not like your job then quit! Nobody is paying for my travels nor is it free. At the very least, be courteous. If we weren’t traveling you wouldn’t even have the option to have your job.

They actually came on a repatriation Flight due to a lockdown in India because of covid-19 through the US government and this airport was the only place it ended from Mumbai. I was hoping to avoid this airport for them but due to the circumstances I couldn’t. Sadly, even our beloved Southwest Airlines counter agent who was checking them into their Chicago flight was not nice to them.

First, it started just before South terminal baggage claim by doors S3, winds along the right side of the hall to the south terminal then crosses the hall and winds back up the left side to the entry door of Clear. Then the shared hall with regular TSA Lines. Looks like at least one of the Clear machines is broken. But the TSA lines and regular Clear lines look to be as long or longer. What gives?

Making me now have to leave security. It is my right to have a place too. The non-smokers and health conscience individuals I am by no means stating you have to be around my smoke just like I don't want to drink your juice or eat your vegetable burger. I, as a conscientious smoker, try to remember that everyone has a right but now you are removing my right as an American to enjoy what I enjoy.

That was the entire reason I always chose this airport! I will not do so anymore! What is the point of removing the smoking rooms? It’s not going to help or make anyone quit smoking - it’s only going to increase the number of angry passengers. Before at least you could chill out with a smoke before your flight and/or get a smoke in between flights - helped with the mental stress of flying! Not having that break in between made my travel day horrible! And the rooms were not bothering non-smoking people nor polluting the air around them - non-smokers never had to go anywhere in those rooms if they didn’t want to so that would not be a good reason to remove them either!

We had a 5 hour layover, which is approximately 5 and half hours longer than I would like in hindsight. The rudeness of everyone who works here is unreal. Being my first time in Atlanta, and the South being renowned for genteel manners and politeness I put on my best manners and did my very best not to be just another horrid Yankee. Workers were rude to me, my wife, my 9 year old ... I think they would've verbally abused my luggage if I wasn't in transit.",-1

I travel about once a month. Most of my destinations are flying through Atlanta airport. Every single time I've encountered the most extreme rude behavior from staff at this airport. Delta customer service in Atlanta - horribly rude. Fast food workers on the tram - rude, discussing buying guns at obnoxious loudness, laying feet up so disabled and elderly can't sit down, etc.. This time I was in Savannah's candy kitchen and a girl came out from the back room and ran directly into me because apparently I was in her way of trying to leave work. I was standing in line trying to buy something. Every experience at this airport is miserable. I'll take the longer way next time.",-1

I sometime feel less cramped at New York Grand Central at Peak hours. Among the worst is going through security! There was a failed attempt to innovate screening with the worst luggage pre-scan staging invented by a 3-year old that obviously did not have any idea what he was doing. Then there is the useless Clear which ends up being slower than regular TSA-Pre most of the time. Finally there is that weird attempt to reduce TSA-Pre load by randomly picking people in the line to give them a privileged queue which is annoying everybody else that will be left in there for another 10 or 15 mins. After Security there is really nothing to make you forget the bad start, it is an average or bad experience at best, specifically if you want to sit quietly and even worse if you think about working.",-1

Other passengers were letting us go in front of them but we had no chance, it was impossible. All they had to do was let us go to the front of the line, what was even more frustrating was we had to catch a cruise ship the next day. Immigration say sort it out with your airline, absolutely disgusting I would avoid this airport never have I come across so bad manners. No customer Service at all.",-1

On each occasion, the immigration queues were well over 1 hour, and on the return trip after 1hr 20 mins, I had to ask people if I could jump the queue as I was in danger of missing my connecting flight to the UK. At least half the booths were unused. Asked a member of staff if she could help but she just said: ""you'll just have to wait in line"". I thanked her for her help. Perhaps they weren't expecting a large number of people arriving all at once? Is this an example of American efficiency? It doesn't give a very good impression to anyone travelling through!",-1

When trying to find TSA Precheck, representatives refused to answer a question and over talked me not allowing me to show them I was TSA precheck therefore not needing general boarding.

2019-11-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,a huge queue and very few staff on duty,True," We had to connect through Atlanta on a flight from London Heathrow to Orlando. We had enough time for the connection and as the plane landed slightly early there should have been no problem. When we got to Passport and Immigration control there was a huge queue and very few staff on duty. We waited well over an hour in this line before we were allowed to go through. Then to our horror we found that we had to go through security again even though we had been through security at Heathrow and had not left the airport. Going through the channel for connecting flights should have made things easier but the staff seemed to not be aware or didn’t care that people had other flights to get to. The security channel was chaos - there was no proper line, it was totally disorganised and the staff were surly and unhelpful. Lots of people were in danger of missing their flights but they just didn’t care! They seemed to take pleasure in working as slowly as they could. We had to run to our departure gate but it had been closed and even though it hadn’t left we couldn’t board. We weren’t the only people to miss that flight and we met lots of people who had also missed their connections because of this incompetence. As we couldn’t get another flight till the next day we had to pay for overnight accommodation. I would never travel through this dreadful airport again.",-1

The employees at ATL airport especially TSA are so rude and disrespectful and need to be retrained in customer service and social skills. The reps are calling people stupid and actually using that term. After literally being screamed at I had to interject when a rep screamed at my daughter. I refuse to allow anyone to disrespect me and my family, this is the second time I had to fly out of this airport and will be the last. She and her colleagues upset me so much, I believe they use their positions to be very controlling. It was a total embarrassment but I’m not a child and will not be treated like one. After going off on the TSA rep telling her she don’t have to talk to people in that way She advised me “if I didn’t like the way it was, to go elsewhere, and let her move before she got snappy”. I wish I would have gotten all their names.",-1

What happens if someone misses their connecting flight? Will they just say “too bad?”. Terrible airport — moving forward, we will make sure never to have a connecting stop here!",-1

After my mom and I got off our flight, we proceeded to the exit and asked the gentleman if he could help give us directions to the gate of our next flight. He looked up and I quote, ""Look at the T.V. screen. I don't know about that."" I don't know if he was just being lazy or if he really did know his job. Anyway, I walk away and overhear some of the other passengers talking about the same flight so I followed them. Still doubting myself, I ask three other Atlanta Airport employees and they all said the same thing; that they had no clue to that too. At last, I finally had enough of the same answer; knowing that my boarding time was closing in, I asked a pilot if he could help me for a second and he did. I feel terrible that I didn't even catch his name, but I am so thankful that he was able to spare a second to help. Again, I hope that Atlanta's Airport works on their customer service.",-1

A recurring problem is understaffing at TSA lanes when the airport admin clearly knows how many passengers will be traveling at any given time. Today TSA decided to run a canine check in the middle of the busiest Monday morning rush hour leading to lines way down the hall and shutting down all priority lanes. First time I have missed a flight in over 30 years and I travel weekly. I explained to airport staff directing people that my flight wears boarding as time passed. Nothing they could do. Except they would take others randomly who were rushing and brought them to the front of the line. Big disruption in one day emergency trip.,-1

Staff members all over the airport - in the terminals, the shuttle, the gates, were all cursing and obnoxious. At 2am, a guy at gate D2 was opening one of the stores, and blasting hip hop music. This is at a gate where our flights had been delayed by hours on end, everyone is cranky and sleepy, and this dude blasting music without a care in the world.

Even the airport police. I have never been treated so bad in my life. The officer literally screamed at me for not hearing him. I am a senior with a hearing disability and I am not a criminal. I also do not appreciate to be yelled at. He upset me so much. They made us late and we missed our flight out. They have zero social skills. They need to be retrained. I believe they use their positions to be very controlling. I will never fly through that airport again. First time I ever have and will never return. All the staff were rude, but this officer about had me in tears. It was a total embarrassment and I’m not a child, and will not be treated like one. The money exchange lady, had no name tag and she was also very rude. She told me if I didn’t like the way it was, to go elsewhere. All I did was clarify a question. I wouldnt doubt she ripped me off. Horrible people there. I will spread the word around my neck of the woods to ‘Don’t travel through Atlanta’ if at all possible. The bathrooms were least desirable as well.",-1
2019-07-16,0.2,Family Leisure,3,5,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,staff in Atlanta airport are rude,True,"  Delta seating was spacious and clean, onboard staff were friendly and attentive, complimentary snacks and beverages, and the flight was on time.  I paid $1057 for myself and 2 kids to fly one way for a total duration of 1.5 hrs. This airline promised free WiFi but the WiFi doesn’t work. The ground agents/staff working in the Atlanta airport are rude. When checking my bag in, the rep looked at me as if I was bothering her. She never greeted me with hello or a smile. I was clearly confused as the Atlanta airport is 5x the size of my hometown airport and even said out loud, “I don’t know where to go”. She just ignored me and looked away. I eventually figured it out but it would’ve been extremely helpful if she just pointed or simply said that way. I’m sorry but if I’m paying Delta over 1k to fly I’d at least like to receive decent customer service. I think Delta should invest in customer service training. This was my first experience flying with Delta and my last.",-1

2019-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,employees are incompetent,True," 9 of us were supposed to fly out of the Hartfield Jackson airport to go to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic for a family vacation. We were supposed to travel by Swift Air, a small charter company. Atlanta Airport is huge and all of us were at the airport international terminal 3.5 hours before our flight. We have looked around for Swift Air signs but did not see any, so we asked 3 different airport customer service representatives, showed them our travel documents, and all of them told us that we have to go to the Domestic terminal, even though it was an international flight. We also stopped by the information desk at the international terminal, showed our paperwork, the customer service representative checked something on her computer and also advised us to go to the domestic terminal. It takes at least 20 min to get to the Domestic terminal plus the waiting time for the shuttle. Once we got there and run around through the whole terminal, asked several staff members, who had no idea where Swift Air was, we finally got to one of the TSA members who used his radio to find out that Swift is at the International terminal. After we spend $50 on the taxi for 20 min drive, since we were running out of time, we got back to where we started. We ran through the whole terminal and finally found Swift Air counters all the way in the back of the terminal with no signs in the whole airport to guide people where to go, except for the signs on top of the counter. Also, all of the international terminal staff members had no clue where Swift Air counters were! We got to the counter 45 minutes before the flight, but we were denied boarding, as well as another family of 5, who went through the same ordeal. I do not understand why airport employees are incompetent and not knowledgeable. No one knows which airline is located at what terminal. Due to all of this, we had to purchase new tickets from Birmingham, AL with a connection back in Atlanta, for the next morning. We had to rent 2 cars, drive 3 hours to AL, fly back to Atlanta to finally board to Punta Cana, all due to the incompetency of staff working at the airport. I always thought that one of the largest international airports in the US would have exceptional customer service, but I was so wrong.",-1
2019-06-23,0.1,Business,5,4,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,behavior was unacceptable,False," I fly through ATL several times a week. Today I had a few hours between my connecting flights so I stopped through the E concourse food court area to grab a bite. I purchased food from Nature’s Table Bistro. I sat down, ate, made some calls and about an hour later, I started to make my way over to my next gate. I had quite a bit of food still left on my plate since I got full very fast; but don’t like traveling with unnecessary baggage. When I went to throw away my plate, a man was changing out the trash bags. When I handed him my plate, he opened the lid and very rudely told me how wasteful I was and that I shouldn’t be throwing away fresh food. When I walked away, I could hear him talking about me to his coworker and he continued to shake his head at me. I was irritated because I purchased the food with my own money and I’m not obligated to defend the amount that I choose not to eat. Every time I fly through ATL, I prepare myself for this kind of treatment because it happens more often than not. I only wish there was someone I could talk to directly about him. His behavior was unacceptable.",-1

The check in (admittedly not the airports fault) took over half an hour at the front of the line to check in for business class. Someone checking in 16 bags in the first class line but not flying first or business. Then endless queues for passport checks and photos and an inordinately long wait for luggage checks with queues snaking round the block and just two screeners. Took over an hour to go from check in to the departure lounge. No one smiled or apologised. Then the lounge was like a zoo. Nowhere to sit and sandwiches with the bread curled up and hard. I had asked for help with lifting my bags even through I’m only three weeks post op with a large bandage and dressing on my neck. I would do my best to avoid in future.,-1

We departed the plane, entered the airport and the janitorial cleaning crew had all the men restrooms blocked off as if they were cleaning them, but what's strange is they were standing in front of the ropes off area preventing entrance or use of the restroom. It's sad that you cant use the restroom in the airport.",-1

",True," I was unfortunate enough to have to attend a meeting in Atlanta, unfortunate not because of Atlanta but because I had to pass through this airport. The layout is just crazy with incredibly long terminals so be sure to where your walking shoes. TSA is a nightmare as all passengers for all airlines pass through a central checkpoint which is so incredibly slow, the slowest service I have ever encountered (including Orlando which at least spilts to two terminal wings) and I’ve been through a number of airports. Even the TSA Pre line had about a half hour plus wait. The airport itself looks old although clean and seems to lack some of the new tech like charging stations for devices that you would expect to find in this day and age. I flew JetBlue out of JFK for this trip and what a difference between JetBlues own terminal 5 and this hole in the wall. If you can avoid passing through this airport I highly recommend it as many of the people don’t really seem to care about the travelers passing through and if you have a connecting flight that’s either at a distant gate or concourse you may miss your flight as they are so far away. There are no terminal shuttle carts like you would find in other big airports like Dallas or Raleigh Durham.",-1

Considering that I have traveled to over 50 countries and all over the United States, that says a lot. I have been in and out of Atlanta at least 10 times in the last six months. I have TSA Pre and Clear and still I meet mass confusion when I’m checking in. This airport is a busy airport for business people, so there are lots of early flights. Maybe TSA doesn’t know that because there’s always one end of security that’s closed. Picking someone up from here isn’t any easier. Departures are both up and downstairs and the signs are last minute so you may miss it. Of course there’s major construction going on so when you miss it will take a while to get back around. Good luck and have a nice flight",-1

ATL is hands down the worst airport to travel to. The majority of the people who work at the airport are bitter, rude and ready to take it out on you. It’s a huge airport and they don’t really think AC is necessary. Especially when they heard you into crowded stalls for TSA. Every flight in and out is delayed. I’m not the only one - ATL is a legend in the field. Avoid it at all costs they say. Wish I could!",-1

Massive lines at immigration, for foreign and US citizens, took 1 hour 50 minutes to get through.

You also notice there's minimal signage that's flat to the wall which is why you couldn't find it. Delta rep said it's down half the time. Apparently there are terminal maps on the ATL website which they should communicate this at their poorly functioning electronic directory screens. No easy way to report these kinds of problems to the airport",-1

On arrival at 5:15 pm the terminal was crowded already and there was no movement in the line at all for about 30 minutes, there didn't seem to be any officials working at all but could not verify this because of size of crowd. Line moved very slowly and as planes kept arriving crowd grew. Personnel controlling crowd did not offer clear guidance and could not be heard. I cleared Customs at 7:15, 2 hours later. then TSA had to be cleared - take off shoes, etc, pick up luggage and reroute, then a mad dash to connecting flight. Why was this day worse than during other international flights. I will never connect in ATL again even for domestic flights.",-1

We along with hundreds of other passengers waited over 2 hours to get to Customs agent, no kiosks were in use. We and many others missed our connections, our flight was at 8:30 pm, so plenty of time. We could not get a flight out until the following morning, had to get a hotel room and lost work time on Monday. This experience was an unbelievable embarrassment to the US. We have traveled out of the country many times and have never experienced such a lack of service, caring and unprofessionalism. From the other reviews here it is evident that this is commonplace in Atlanta. When given a choice we will not come through Atlanta again. Atlanta airport and US Customs displayed a very unfriendly and disappointing reflection on our country. Sad to know that this is an entry way to our country and the 1st impression visitors will encounter.",-1

The lines went back and forth around the agents desks and then went down 4 or 5 more hallways. Literally everyone around us missed their connecting flights, including us. Staff were miserable and rude and didn’t care one bit or try to help in any way. One giggled when I told her that we had been in line for 1.5hr so far and only had 20 minutes before our plane was taking off. Her exact words were “well you are going to miss” and she walked away. Won’t be scheduling any layovers in Atlanta again. Delta did exchange new flights for the next morning and a room for the night at no charge.",-1

Staff did not seem knowledgeable in any way. They snatched tickets from peoples hands, they did not make eye contact and were rude all the way through the process. One particular security lady was a perfect example of how rude this airport's staff is. Without provocation she starts getting at me about the smallest things and being condensing beyond what I have ever experienced in my life and continued to verbally abuse me until I went through the scanner. I have never met such people in my life who made me regret coming back to the USA from Europe. Who wants to be welcomed by these people.",-1

We arrived in Atlanta to go thru passport/immigration control. There are about 20 passport scanners but only two were being utilized. Everyone had to go thru extremely long lines to get to a counter with a person, of which there were maybe 7, with hundreds of people in line. Employees shouting at us to go in this direction only to have another employee say the opposite when we get there. Bickering between airport employees, no clear signs about where to go. Not sure I understand the need to go thru airport security again after an international flight. This was the worst run airport for passport control I have ever seen. It was embarrassing for the US, especially when traveling overseas and see how European airports are managed. This can be so much better but no one seems to care unless they are the ones that have to go thru it. I will try to avoid the Atlanta airport when I am traveling international. Not worth the headache.",-1

",False,"  
We arrived from St. Maarten, 3/24/19 at 7pm. It took 15-20 minutes to go through Global Entry. There were 10 kiosks and 2 were operational. People were using the kiosk that did not have GE, tying up the line and being rejected. Since we had a long lay over we waited for our family members to pick up their bags. It took them 2 hours and 15 minutes to get through customs. As we waited at the bottom of the escalator we noticed that in that amount of time the board with carousel assignments was never corrected to the proper carousel. Our flights baggage was on #1, the board read 4 the entire evening.",-1

When finally reaching the front of the line, very few stations were staffed (looked as though 3/4 of stations were unstaffed).

First, it took us 2 hours to get through customs and the kiosks were all working but we still had to go to a desk. Once we finally got through customs, our flight had been delayed due to weather which is understandable but then once we finally boarded the plane we are sitting here for almost an hour just for the captain to announce that the airport has lost some people’s bags.

I travel every week for work and have flown into dozens of US airports in the last 10 years, so I say this with a great deal of travel experience. The security lines are always long, even the TSA pre-check lines I use are long. In fact, these are often longer than the normal security lines at other major airports. They’ve also made a change so there’s only one entry into TSA pre-check so it’s quite a haul for most passengers coming into the terminal on ‘the wrong side.’ Again, no other major airport in the US has this major inconvenience like ATL. Also, the facility is not in the greatest shape for such a prominent airport, and I seem to encounter a lot more rude people there between security line herders and unfriendly airline staff; attitudes abound. I don’t know what’s in the water in Atlanta, but I think the ATL Airport Authority and airline management would be well served to get out of their office and walk around the terminals more and see the experience us travelers are having in their airport. While I love the city of Atlanta, I dread having to travel there for business every time due to the very negative aspects of the airport experience.",-1

Had wheelchair requested because I can’t walk fast enough to get from point A to point B on time because of knee and hip issues. There was no chair at the plane, so I began to walk. The first person I came to was at immigration. I ask about a chair and her reply was that I should have stayed at the plane. She ask another “worker” but while they stood there telling me it was my fault, I continued on because at immigration we had to stand in line on one side of the building to be able to then let go in groups to stand in line on the other side. I ask immigration officer if he knew who I could ask about it. He said Delta desk. Ask another man on the way to baggage claim. He said down stairs. Ask a young man down stairs, he said down hall on right. Never saw a desk. Checked bag again, then ask a Delta employee, who ask another ”worker” if she had a radio. No response! Went through security and ask what gate our flight left from because it wasn’t on ticket. Had to go back upstairs to E5. When we got back upstairs saw a young man in a golf cart who ask if we needed a ride to our gate. Was so thankful for this offer, I could have cried! It wasn’t that much farther but I could hardly put one foot in front of the other. This is the first time I have ever ask for a chair and not got it but it was very inconvenient and painful.

There were no signs or anything, I just wanted to make sure to go in the right direction. Please get rid of employees like this, hire decent and nice people. This airport has been the worst experience with customer service, after traveling from an airport in a country where quality of life is less than in the US and you get to the US and there is a huge difference in how people treat you.

Can you fix stupid? I hope so. Dropping off and picking up passengers is, to repeat myself, stupid. Flown into KATL many times over the decades but today was my first time trying to drop off a passenger. I’ve performed this task all over the country, at airports large and small; I expected one of the busiest airports (in the world) to be, well, organised. To some degree.

2018-09-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,understaffed immigration area,True,"  The immigration and passport check for US Citizens returning to the US was appalling. We almost missed our flight with 1hr and 42 minutes between flights, all spent in one very poorly organized and understaffed immigration area. We usually fly into JFK on flights from Europe so we are very familiar with the procedure but I have never seen such a poor arrangement as the one in Atlanta. We were returning from Guadeloupe to Newark via Atlanta on a Saturday evening and joined approximately 800 others arriving from So. America and the Caribbean who were 90% returning American citizens. We were funneled into a huge room full of crazy 8 lines and zig zags of lined up people being directed by airport attendants who tried to be helpful but it was pretty hard to help with directions. And there were only about 8 of them and maybe 10 immigration officers. There would have been triple that number at JFK. The airport personnel tried to help expedite the kiosks (which don't generally help because no one really gets what you're supposed to do - the cards were easier!) in our case these people were quite helpful, but you had to wait in line for every step. It took us a full 1hr 30 min. to get through that, many of us figuring we were never going to make our next flights. An airport employee did look up our gate for us. Of course it was at the literal other end of the terminal (from Term F to A). Then we had to get our bags (6 carousels with 4 flights on each one....!) and get them to the next point where the baggage handlers were actually very efficient and pleasant despite the total chaos. They seemed used to it. Then security again which because of the throngs of people (we had already been through it anyway), they just sort of let us pass by except for a few poor souls who had to have their things inspected. They need many more immigration officers working at that airport and it would have been very embarrassing to witness that scene with foreign nationals trying to navigate it. Not a very nice ""Welcome to America"".",-1
2018-08-26,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,such a disappointing experience,True," After returning from a trip in Central America, my family and I had to go through customs. This was not our first time having to go through customs. As we arrived at customs, the line was huge. We were sent down a hallway, where we waited in a line that zig zagged forever. Once we reached the area where we would choose which section to go (U.S. citizens, foreign visitors, mobile passport), we went into the mobile passport line. After waiting in the line for about fifteen minutes we realized we were waiting in the wrong line. That line was for foreign visitors. So we went back and asked again and she told us we were in the wrong line. We finally were in the right line after waiting already about two hours in line for customs so far. All of our flights were departing soon so we needed to get through customs and security quickly. As we approached the stand for mobile passport, the woman who was working rudely asked us if we were a family living in the same household. We replied no, and then took one family at a time. She was the most unpleasant agent I have ever encountered. She was miserable. She was not respectful at all! I understand that she deals with a lot of people during the day but that is no reason for her to be miserable and rude to people entering the country. It is so embarrassing to think about people coming to the United States for the first time. The first they encounter is horribly long lines for customs and then rude employees. At the point in customs I was so embarrassed to be an American. I have traveled through the Atlanta airport many times and every time it is more and more disappointing. Such a disappointing experience. I will now avoid traveling through the Atlanta airport. We all almost missed our flights. After customs the security was so disorganized. The employees didn’t seem to know anything or know what the heck they were supposed to be doing. Horrible experience in the Atlanta airport.",-1
2018-08-24,0.7,Business,1,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,generally find little to complain about,True," I travel through Atlanta Airport several times a year, and generally find little to complain about considering the size of it together with the vast amount of travelers that travel through it. I also realize that my complaint is not necessarily due to the airport authorities but rather to Border & Customs Control. With the recent additions of passport kiosks where the traveler enters their passport and customs declaration, I thought that would speed up the process of entering the country from abroad, but this is not the case. We still have to present our credentials to be inspected by a decreasing number of officers. This has increased the entry time drastically. As a US citizen, having to wait for 2-1/2 hours in line to be seen by an Immigration officer is beyond belief.",1
2018-08-23,0.1,Business,1,2,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,2 hours from car to gate,True," For one of the busiest airports in the country, the South Terminal has the absolute least efficient checkpoint. First, there is only a single checkpoint for 8 terminals. Second, the lines for SWA Flyby and other priority board are barely marked or nonexistent. Then the security scan allows people from behind you in line to move past you and push their bags through such that there is an inevitable backlog wherein the people who have already put their belongings in bins are waiting to push those bins through and people who have already gone through body scan are waiting for their luggage, instead of making any attempt whatsoever to keep luggage with owners during the process. Only the trains run with any respectable efficiency to reduce the trek from rental car drop-off to gate to a mere mile. Nearly 2 hours from car to gate is unacceptable for such a central airport. I will avoid flying through here at all costs in the future. Also, unable to get on the wi-fi.",-1

There were cars everywhere backing up and switching lines. 30 minutes have passed and I’m still sitting behind 3 other cars in another line. Finally a cashier was able to manually scan my ticket.

Their bin system when you are about to send your luggage through at security is confusing and frankly stupid. The TSA employees don’t communicate professionally in any way. They don’t make eye contact and answer questions rudely like an insubordinate child would. Why are people with such poor communication skills being hired? They are also many people that simply stand around with no apparent responsibilities. I don’t see these problems with anywhere near the severity and frequency at other large airports.

",False,"  Typically I don't write reviews for poor service because I believe that most people don't write them for good service either. However, the customer service at Atlanta-Hartsfield airport has been consistently very rude and condescending. It's become so common place that I don't even want to choose Delta anymore to avoid going through Atlanta. Almost every employee has an attitude and you can tell they think it's funny to be rude. I went to the food court to get a slice of pizza and am greeted with, ""what u want?"". When I politely said, ""I'm sorry"", the employee repeated herself. I proceeded to be nice and smiled throughout my experience only to be met with mumbling, no eye contact and laughter among the employees. It's not just the food service employees. I witnessed an older gentleman who was an airport employee ask another young employee for help with an elderly passenger. The young employee responded with some verbal disgust and then she proceeded to roughly handle the elderly passenger in a wheelchair. I really think the airport should focus on customer service relations and training. Every experience I've had there has involved a minimum of one, and usually more than one rude employees. Please be advised that I'm not talking about any TSA employee. They have a tough job and aren't part of this conversation. I would have airport management take off their uniform and interact with the airport employees. It won't take them long to see what myself and many others are telling them. Quite frankly, I'm extremely embarrassed the customer service at Atlanta-Hartsfield is what many foreign travelers base their opinion of Americans and our hospitality on.",-1
2018-06-23,0.1,Business,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,my least favorite airport,True," Airport Authority severely punishes ride-share (Uber/Lyft) users. This is truly my least favorite airport in the US. Part of it is the fact that as I fly out of the DFW airport most of the time, I am usually on American Airlines and their gates at the Atlanta airport are about a mile from any ground transportation area. I have suffered that indignity in silence for several years, however I finally was tipped over the edge this latest trip when I dared to use Uber/Lyft at the airport. The airport authority clearly has a strong distaste for ride share companies and is doing all they can to frustrate travelers from using them. After walking a mile from the gate to the ground transportation area, I had to ask 3 individuals how to get to the ride share area before I found the down escalator nestled among the baggage carousels that took me to the correct exit. Upon finding the exit, it was another mile walk outside in the Atlanta heat to the designated ride share pickup area. At that point, as the ride share app would not let me choose a location for pickup until I was there, I had to wait another 10 minutes for the Lyft driver to come from their designated wait area. The drivers for the ride shares are also confused about where to pull in to pick up passengers and there was often traffic bottlenecks as folks loaded up. There were also about 100 riders waiting in the pickup area and this was at 8.30pm on a Monday night. The ordeal added at least 30 minutes to my arrival time and left me hot and angry. Let me repeat, the Atlanta airport sucks.",-1

They changed the locations of the TSA Pre-Check and when I asked an employee where to go, I was snapped at. I heard a TSA worker mumble something at a man that asked her a legitimate question and when he asked her ""pardon?"" she replied ""Don't yell at me sir!"". Since I had TSA pre-check I assumed that we did not need to remove shoes, laptops, etc. so I did not. The agent at the Checkpoint basically ""goated"" me into a response when she got nasty with me about leaving my iPad in my carry on. She removed it and just started ""bouncing & slamming"" it through the x-ray. They basically opened up my carry on and took items out randomly and re-ran them through x-ray. (I figured if you want to see my dirty underwear - that's your prerogative!) However, I did not say a word because I cannot afford to end up on a no-fly list. I was then herded through the scanner. I felt sorry for a poor elderly lady in front of me. She was in a wheelchair and they were trying to make her walk through the x-ray. She clearly could not walk - no mercy or kindness from the TSA agents. (Like this 80+ year old woman was a security risk!). I am very disappointed in Atlanta TSA - actually I'm still very angry at the rudeness they showed. But the thing that angers me the most is that these TSA agents can act/speak to you any way they want - but when you try to speak back to them in the same tone, you are the one that suffers.

And more than half of them were in the passport control area. Had those 12 employees been task to assist maybe the process could have been more customer accommodating.

Today, the security checkpoint pulled numerous bags out to search in a row, including mine. When she said I couldn’t have an aerosol with me (holding a hair product that I’ve flown with several times), I calmly said “oh that isn’t a liquid or aerosol” and she responded “oh well it’s in the trash” and threw it away.

Our next flight to Indianapolis was scheduled to depart at 7:24 pm. Getting through Customs and security was an absolute nightmare. After clearing customs and security, we had to move quickly and arrived at our gate for the next flight as they were boarding Zone 2. We had nothing to declare, there weren't any issues with us, the problem is the lack of adequate working staff for the volume of people attempting to clear customs. Everyone around us was frantic about potentially missing their connections and there is no recourse because as were told by the airport employees ""everyone here has a connecting flight"". We have no intention of ever taking another international flight that requires us to go through customs in Atlanta. We have cleared customs in O'Hare, Dallas, Miami, and New York, and Atlanta is by far the most unorganized, poorly staffed and chaotic we have encountered and will be avoided in the future unless you have four to five hours between connections.",-1

It was chaos, and no one was willing to help the several people who were standing in line and missing their flights. Not to mention, every employee I interacted with at the airport was very unpleasant and rude. I had to spend over $200 to book another flight since I missed mine. I’m sure this happens often, but I’m very displeased with the treatment by the employees and the way security was run. For a busy airport, they have poor organization. Im going to make my best efforts to never fly out of this airport ever again.",-1

",False,"  Quite horrible experience trying to move through customs. Here there are literally more employed bystanders/onlookers than there are people actually doing something sensible. Most of those working there are unable to communicate or help people. Together with some other passengers I was approaching the end of the line (maybe 30 other passengers left in front of three counters actually operated, 15-16 counters were not), when we were told to use the self-service kiosks. When this was finished they sent us to the end of another line consisting of 4-500 people, with yet another manual check. They simply don’t have clue on how to manage these processes at Atlanta. I’ll advise them to check out maybe Schiphol to learn something. Don’t ever travel through Atlanta with kids.",-1

However, if you are traveling to places in the American South, it is difficult to avoid Atlanta especially with Delta being the predominant carrier here. But my recent trip through Hartsfield was totally stress free. I arrived in Terminal 1 and had to connect at an end gate in Terminal 3 and I had exactly 2 hours and 1 minute to accomplish this. The directional signs were prominent and plentiful and I took the shuttle train that connects the terminals - no wait for it at all. All the terminals had plenty of eateries at all price points. I found many chairs to sit. Bathrooms were located at convenient intervals in each terminals and were clean with working faucets, liquid soaps and paper towels. Announcements at the gates were frequently made. Big display boards listed all departing flights and gates. It was a very smooth connection I had without causing any anxiety or uncertainty. It is a remarkable accomplishment to process so many people all the time every day!",1

Twice as many for domestic. And at least 10 TSA staff standing around literally doing nothing. I had a lot of time to observe them! When I commented to the immigration official as to how shocked I was at how it was managed he laughed and I must never have been to Atlanta before. Well I never will again. Shambolic.

There is nothing in place to separate people who are in transit to those who are actually staying in the US so it was complete mayhem as people queued for an hour at immigration watching the minutes to their next flight tick by. The staff were rude and completely unhelpful and seemed to shift lines about randomly so some people ended up through quicker despite others having earlier flights to catch. We asked several times, as did others, what to do about our connecting flight and were quite bluntly told it was basically tough luck and the only option was to see if people would let you cut in line. If that’s your only suggestion what exactly is your job role here other than to stand around and annoy people? We then had the same queue and problems at security therefore missing our flight. The staff at the Delta desk were also very rude and blamed the fact that it’s the busiest airport in the world. Clearly better systems should be in place if that’s the case. The consequence was that we had to actually pay to stay in a hotel overnight so we could fly the next morning. An absolute shambles of an airport with rude and very unhelpful staff. I’ve used many airports around the world for transit and have never had this issue before.",-1

",True," Absolutely awful airport. Busy and so unorganised. You are asked to queue in various queues at customs and watch as people who come after you in the queue are moved to a new queue that is seen to be faster than you are and then as you approach the front of the queue you get moved again. So badly organised, queues should be first come first serve. Takes so long to get through customs before you can claim baggage to walk around a corner and place it to be on your next flight just because you're transit is in Altlanta. This is before you even get through security and run to your gate to catch your next plane. Staff do not care that you may have a connecting flight. Awful experience both to and from whilst using Atlanta as transit. Will certainly be avoiding in the future.",-1

Walked to tram and checked the board again for gate information. Still B29. Got off at Terminal B and walked to Gate B29. Checked the board once again. B29. Sat down at B29 for at least an hour and a half. No mention of a gate change. No announcement of a gate change. Other flights going out to Philly and Pittsburgh from B29. Fifteen minutes before departure, I see a monitor stating that gate was now B6, all the way across the terminal other end. Hustled down to B6. with two minutes to departure time. Was told the cabin door had been closed and the plane was about to pull away. They could rebook me for another flight later that day. Was smugly told I should look at the monitors to get gate information. Really disappointed in Delta especially given this was their hub operation. Not pleasant. Rethinking future plans.",-1
2018-03-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,3.0,clearly under-capacity,True," In transit from Punta Cana (Dom. Rep.) to Amsterdam. The largest and busiest airport in the world, but clearly under-capacity. Bag drop and customer assistance counters had reasonably short wait times, but queues for immigration and security checks were very long, even at off-peak times. The immigration officer I had was much more polite and respectful than most of those I've experienced at US airports. TSA agents were polite and seemed professional, if a little laid-back. Some areas of the airport have better food options than others, depending on which concourse/terminal you're in. One thing that caused me some stress was the fact that I received different answers from different personnel. Every time I've passed through the US in the past, I've always had to clear immigration with my baggage (i.e. collect baggage from the carousel, clear immigration, then drop off baggage again). As my baggage wasn't on the carousel, I asked a few airport personnel, who were all polite and friendly enough, but they all told me different things. Some said always collect your baggage, some said it wasn't necessary because of my final destination, some said my luggage must have been lost, and some said to check at the gate when boarding (which would have been too late at that point). My layover was 2hrs 25mins. I only arrived at the departure gate around 20 mins before scheduled departure time, which was 40 mins after they started boarding. My advice would be to leave yourself at least 3 hours between flights but, even at that, you won't have much time to eat, shop or relax. Because of this, I will avoid this airport in future.",-1

The planning included an almost three hour layover at ATL to pass through Customs and security. The confusion, lack of available personnel to help and administer travelers was the worst I have seen in 50 years of airline travel. It took more than two and one half hours to clear customs and security. We have TSA traveler number, but the attendant told us it was not applicable at this location. Many travelers missed their connecting flights, and pickup service. After running, we finally arrived at our gate at 9.55, only to be told our airline was on the tamac and was being held up. So after all of that delay we got on the Delta plane after it was 25 minutes late. This is all in good clear weather? Over three hours later.",-1

Even though the people were nice enough, the airport was so busy that our early arriving plane of 10 minutes had to wait 30 minutes to get to the gate. Then after going through a Global Entry, I found out they don’t have Global Entry security lanes from international to local travel. Why be a known Traveler with Global Entry when you can’t through security for another hour? From the time of landing to getting through security for our connecting flight was 2 hours! I will never buy a ticket again with ATL as a connecting airport. Backwards airport with lazy TSA.",-1

Unfortunately, that's not true. As someone who's traveled extensively through the US (every week) and internationally (several times a year), I'd like to believe I've seen the gamut of airport experiences. ATL continues to be one of the worst on my list (rivaling SEA). The security screening process at ATL is an absolute nightmare. It's the slowest, most inefficient security check process I've seen. It'll take you well over 35-40 mins to get to the TSA officer who screens your boarding pass, and that's on a ""good"" day. The TSA staff can clearly see the huge line, but refuse to open up more checkpoints/belts. Worse, the airport monitors continue to project a delusion that the wait time at all the checkpoints is less than 15 mins. I'm baffled how they could lie outright like that. Another issue is the belts for carry on screening. They have a bin system, wherein you have to fill up several and push them on to the belt. Leads to all sorts of confusion, and I've timed it and know for a fact that it's slower than the simple ""push through"" at most major airports. Overall, despite being the busiest airport in the country, ATL has a huge scope for improvement in terms of the efficiency of the security screening and boarding process.",-1

Once you have waited over an hour to get through security, there was a group of about 10-15 TSA agents standing around at the security tower with their thumbs in their mouth. This is one job I’m sure everyone wouldn’t mind if they were all replaced by machines. Also not to mention the Southwest check-in/bag drop agents had the same type of I don’t care attitude.

I've traveled for over 30 years and have never had anything but kind, personable staff at this airport. This last trip through Atlanta was completely unrecognizable. Passport control was absolutely hateful to me and my 77 year old mother. He took our passports and hammered us with questions about our trip and when he handed us our passports back he literally said the words ""get outta here"". We were putting our passports away and he said ""go"". It's a horrible thing when I feel more kindness and freedom when I leave the United States. We then get to the security checkpoint and we have more hateful agents screaming at passengers. Their directions are so unclear and confusing that everyone was getting flustered and even seasoned travelers were now confused on what these agents were wanting. Screaming isn't a way to convey a message. Its inefficient, confusion, unnecessary and actually slows down the process. I just cannot figure out what happened to my favorite airport but it makes me sad. It was the only airport that I looked forward to visiting.",-1

We were there just for a connecting flight from Costa Rica to Montreal and we had to wait in line for 2h15 to pass customs. It is unacceptable! We didn’t have any baggage claim, it was directly shipped to Montreal. In other airport there is a special line for those who have a flight to catch soon. Here nobody care if you miss it. The most part of the staff was not professional. We had to take a night at an Hotel, without any compensation from the customs. It is not finish, I bought 2 bottles of rum at the duty free in costa rica, they put it in a sealed bag written duty free, but at the custom in Atlanta they told us that we had to put it in their special red plastic bag?

We got in the queue for immigration and were treated like cattle and shouted at to stay in line. I politely asked if my wife and I could jump the queue so we could be able to get our connecting flight. I was sternly told no and it would just be too bad if we missed our flight! We argued and I asked for the supervisor and was told the same so we did indeed miss the flight because of the ill mannered nature of the US border control officers. The UK is the USA's best ally yet we are treated like we owe the US a favour. TSA are short of a lesson in manners and interpersonal skills. Never again will I go through Atlanta and will avoid the place like the plague. I will say though that I found the Delta Airlines staff very helpful in finding us a flight 2 hours later and they were very sympathetic and aware that the US Immigration staff are a bunch of jobsworths at this airport.,-1

That didn’t happen I was booked on two different flights and both were cancelled. No reason, everything was blamed on weather. Today my flight is delayed again as we have to wait for a crew. The entire customer base gets to wait as they need to get a crew into Louisville to make up a flight there. Although you consistently advertise this as the largest you certainly don’t advertise it to have the overwhelming amount of delays. Also my luggage was already delivered to Louisville or at least some of it. I realize weather plays a part but as an airport a a major hub for Delta you do nothing to accommodate your passengers.",-1

However when we arrived it was absolute chaos, we had to queue initially for an hour to go through security, we were directed to a machine which took fingerprints and a photo then queued again for forty minutes just to have our fingerprints and photo taken again by a border official, we then had to queue for nearly an hour to have our hand luggage scanned and belongings checked by which time we had missed our flight too London. Staff in Atlanta are on a different planner, their streaming process is haywire, they don't want to help and basically kettle everyone like cattle into pointless queues and then have the nerve to have a go at customers for minor misunderstandings. Yes it was quite busy but not so much so to cause this much chaos. Also going to the desk to report missing our flight Delta were not at all interested and just wanted to move the problem onto someone else or rather blame someone else.

I know the customs protocols because I'm still customs certified. Before I went through I allowed a flight crew to get in front of me to expedite their process. The TSA customs agents are very belligerent and unprofessional I can understand the type of job they do on a day to day basis. But, since they deal in a profession that requires you to have interpersonal skills it really leaves something to be desired! My machine was set aside and the agent I asked as to why. Initially she didn't give me an explanation she just said I'll get to your situation in the order in which I receive it in a gruff manner.

I am absolutely floored by the TSA disrespect in Atlanta compared to any other airport. It's a mess! Travelers are treated like cattle in chutes with TSA shouting at us. The new bin process to wait in a queue while bins pass before us is complete chaos. My belongings get separated and I now have greater risk of items being taken because I can't get through the screen to collect items. I now have to wait for a second bin to be allowed to pass into the bin screen lane. Throughout this process TSA are very very rude! They must truly hate their jobs. In contrast at other airports TSA are remarkably professional, courteous and helpful. What's wrong with TSA in Atlanta? It all starts with upper leadership to shape the work culture and attitudes of staff. Leadership should not tolerate workers who disrespect travelers. We are their customers.

The memories of endless immigration queues, officious and rude staff, missing a connection and previous reviews of this airport were still with us so it was a very pleasant surprise when we landed. Bit of a queue at immigration with, of course, the obligatory lack of officers to deal with several long haul flights landing in a short space of time. But there were plenty of the electronic entry machines so the queue moved along OK. Through in about 1/2 hour and then a long trek to the baggage reclaim where our bags were already in. We had a connection to Savannah and upon entry to the transit check-in desks were spotted and told we were already checked into the Delta Flight - so handed over the luggage and were off the the domstic terminal - all within 1 1/4 hours! Very impressive - and even more impressed with the personnel because, without fail, each person we spoke to was courteous, cheerful and helpful!

Something needs to change, at the least expand the security screening area for International to Domestic terminals. On a positive note, the staff at ATL are the most helpful I have encountered in airports",1
2017-09-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,security staff intimidating and rude,False," Security staff are intentionally aggressive, intimidating and rude. The staff shout at you for not following instructions, yet there are no instruction signs to follow. Staff need to be taught that treating all passengers like criminals is not acceptable. I for one will never fly to Atlanta again and would advise everyone else from the UK to not fly here either.",-1
2017-09-07,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,4,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,we'll try to avoid using Atlanta in future,False,"  
My wife and I were flying from the UK to the US to see the Total Solar Eclipse, we officially had just over 1.5 hours to make our connection to Denver, and were told that this would be tight. We actually arrived ahead of schedule, which was great, and then we got to immigration. Used the automatic terminals, which we thought were going to be a great time saver, but then we had to queue for an immigration officer, and our line didn't move for nearly an hour - what's the point in the auto terminals when you still have to queue anyway? Managed to get to our departure gate with about 10-15 minutes to spare (the ""Plane Train"" shuttle breaking down 3 times didn't help). During all this time no-one told us what the delay was caused by, and the (2) officers working the immigration desks were so slow it was almost unbelievable. By the time we finally got through the line behind us was huge, and there must've been people that missed connections - we were just lucky. Wherever possible, we'll try to avoid using Atlanta in future.",-1
2017-09-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,the employees are rude and condescending,False,"  The customs and security process at the international terminal is a disaster. There are not enough employees to handle large flights full of people, especially since the majority have connecting flights to catch. The worst part is that the employees are rude and condescending. They seem to have no idea that on international flights most likely some people don't speak English and yelling instructions in a louder voice isn't going to help. Nor are inappropriate comments by an old man about frisking women in the past helpful. I lived in Atlanta for many years and unfortunately it seems like nothing has changed to improve this process. I was embarrassed to be an American in that line Thursday, August 31.",-1
2017-08-21,0.9,Business,5,4,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,rude and obnoxious,False,  I fly through this airport at least two times per week. I love many aspects but lately the golf cart drivers are honking their horn to get people to move out of their way. I find this horn honking to be rude and obnoxious. Please develop a better procedure and maintain a more peaceful environment.,1
2017-08-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"Awful treatment, dismissive, rude",False,"  Arrived to Atlanta Airport with 1.5hrs to spare between connectig international flights. Queues at immigration were ok but the service officers were super slow. Tried to speak to one of them to explain we had less than an hour, they couldn't care less. They then split us and half of the queue went through the side US citizens go. Used the machines but then they made us queue again to see an officer. What was the point? Awful treatment, dismissive, rude.",-1
2017-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,Unacceptable passport control waiting times,False,"  Unacceptable passport control waiting times. While I totally appreciate extra security protocols across the US airports, the level of inefficiency and lack of customer service is what I find totally unacceptable. This is for an airport that is the number 1 for passenger volume. I just came back from an international flight, and waited for 2 hours in line to go thru passport control. There were 4 officers reviewing passports for thousands of passengers, and more arriving as I stood in line.",-1
2017-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a chaotic mess,False," Atlanta airport is a chaotic mess. Security lines are long and between TSA precheck, clear and general you will have a hard time finding where you need to go through. The scanning area is a joke. Food overpriced with long lines. Trains packed to overflowing. Biggest mess. Staff has no clue when you ask for help.",-1
2017-07-11,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,The officers were nothing but rude,False,"  Awful experience at CBP. After my husband was randomly selected for further screening, we where sent into a line for non US citizens that went on for as far as you could see. The booth for this line had one beyond slow attendant. He spent an average of five minutes plus for one person. The line for US citizens had 4 officers that simply glanced at the passport and literally moved hundreds of people through as our line got longer and longer. We along with a few other US citizens got moved up in line by an employee. When he told us to go to the officer, we along with the employee where yelled at by an another CBP officer to never come up to the booth until called by the officer in the most rude manner, embarrassing the employee and us. The officers were nothing but rude and could not have cared less about the massive amount of people in line, most of which where missing their flights because of a multiple hour process. I do not understand why there was only one officer for what had to be hundreds of people and why they had to be so rude and nasty to everyone. I am all for security, but this was the most inept and rude process I have ever encountered. Atlanta CBP needs much better staffing and officers who are not so rude, angry, and slow.",-1

From security to TSA to a ""customer service rep"" at the gates, every single encounter was rude. No one was willing to help. I arrived at my gate early. I saw a long line of people trying to board a flight that was leaving only thirty minutes before mine was to board. I couldn't get anyone to tell me if my gate had changed. No one would help because I wasn't on the flight they were handling. No one at another gate, no one at the gate I was at. They ended up changing the gates like I suspected. Security had attitude, TSA had attitude and the lady at American Airlines gate was the worst! I will avoid Atlanta Airport at all costs from this day forward.",-1

2017-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1,5,3.0,5.0,0.0,,4.0,1.0,crammed into endless lines,False,"  Never have I seen such a shambolic process and never anywhere in the world have I met such surly and rude officials. Hundreds and hundreds of passengers crammed into endless lines moving at a snails pace. Most of these people had connections and from the fuming and disgruntled comments from just about everyone, it was clear virtually all missed their connections. With hundreds of tired passengers queueing patiently and growing increasingly anxious as it dawned on them that despite having stopover times of over 3 hours they were not going to make their connections. Just imagine that. In that short time period one Sunday afternoon literally hundreds and hundreds of passengers had their travel plans ruined. What was truly astonishing was the fact that the truly miserable and obnoxious officials seemed to somehow relish the chaos they were causing. Throughout most of this time only about 4 booths were operational with most standing unoccupied. In our case, my family had 3 and a half hours between flights but we still missed our onward connection. I personally was led like a criminal to a locked room with several others in order to answer questions regarding something which ""showed up"" on their computer system. The Officer who spoke at me (at not to) clearly had problems understanding the system and eventually I was told that there was a glitch in the system and was free to go. Needless to say no hint of an apology. Having just retired after 30 years in the Police Force I am a staunch supporter of offialdom and of Police and Customs everywhere but I have to say I was astonished at the attitude of the Officers I met and the general shambolic system at Atlanta. One place in the world I will never ever return to.",-1

The queue at the border is mind boggling, it appears they want passengers to miss connections. Some serious work is needed, I'll do everything to avoid the spot in the future.",-1
2017-01-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,long and slow lines,False,"  Terrible long and slow lines operated by TSA people. We are USA citizens and were not able to make it from flight Bonair to Atlanta to Omaha for 2 hours. Missed our flight as many other transit passengers, had to pay for night in hotel. TSA people worked extremely slow and seemed to enjoy holding hundreds of people without moving while letting others who arrived later to go ahead. They would call ""Older than 70 yrs"" to go forward but ot was big group of men in their 40s. TSA people just liked to be bosses. I asked to move us ahead when we had 15 min till next flight and long walk, all I heard was ""everybody has flight in 5 minutes"". The terminal had no air conditioning, people are sweaty, TSA knew about delays and didnt care to call gates about that.  I missed my Sunday job in Omaha and lost $150. Hotel was $99. I am rating this service 1 because of a  Delta lady who was nice to rebook our tickets for next day. Otherwise I would rate it 0. We had no chance to try food or anything. It took 1 hour to find hotel. All those promising ads on terminal wall were joke.",-1

Instead we spent well over an hour in the passport check line in Atlanta airport and even after proceeding through the self check machines which were entirely a waste. The poor quality and lack of efficiency with the passport check process resulted in us missing our flight. We had to take the latest flight of the day after traveling since before 9am Zurich time.

2017-01-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,100% atrocious,False," We've just had our first transit experience at Atlanta and it will assuredly be our last - and that goes for the US as a whole, if Atlanta's inefficient, officious and frequently offensive staff are representative of national practice. Like many other correspondents, we nearly missed our connection, having only allowed 3 whole hours to get through this mess of a 'homeland security system'. Two desultory officials on the 10+ Esta / visa checking desks. Nobody in a hurry, nobody bothered as hoardes of clearly stressed and distressed passengers who'd waited for hours pleaded for help because they were risking missing their flights (many we saw today did). Representative comment from man vaguely minding the queue: 'ain't my problem'. Then downstairs to join another massive queue to go through security screening again (we'd earlier spent 4 hours checking in and being screened in Guatemala). And all the while being barked at by staff standing around chatting (plenty of those available, apparently, after the Esta staff shortage upstairs). Example of one crass command screamed at me (I had the temerity to be pulling my carry-on bag behind me in the queue): 'Bag in front of you - now!' Great welcome to 'the Land of the Free' to be treated like a criminal when you're just trying to change planes - having already submitted to - and paid for - the intrusive Esta check online. It's a shameful, stress-inducing shambles - to be avoided at all costs.",-1

Going through customs was very easy and I mean super quick. I took me all but 5 mins to go through the kiosk and hand them my form. I have TSA precheck and that was not an option to use as of yet.

We had two bags checked in at Panama City, tagged for the final destination. We are non-US citizens, we do have a valid ESTA since a previous visit. On arrival we were directed to a ""first-time-ESTA"" queue because of overload of the correct queue. We were over 100 persons in queue - only one (1) employee serving at the roundabout 20 parallel control points. The queue hardly advanced, frustrated people everywhere. After 1.5 hrs it was our turn. We hurried on, but were told to pick up our checked-in baggage and drop it at another location. We then entered another endless queue for security check.
