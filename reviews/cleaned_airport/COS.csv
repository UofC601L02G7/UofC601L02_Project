2024-09-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,been so strict for no reason,False,"  Their security people and policies are out of control! They have been so strict for no reason. I am a pre-check customer and they found sea salt scrub in my carry on and took me aside to test it. I made it and I could have and offered to eat it. They told me no and then proceeded to take all of my belongings that I had already picked up including my purse, my shoes and cell phone. I find this practice illegal and highly invasive. I had done nothing wrong and because you're incompetent staff was not able to read an explosive test properly (had to call someone to walk him through it), then they inconvenienced me by taking my things and treating me inhumane. For my next flight, I'm driving to Denver. It's cheaper too even with having to pay for parking. Also, when you randomly select people to test their shoes through pre-check, that practice sucks too! You are inconveniencing people that paid to go through security without being harassed.",-1
2024-02-20,0.3,Business,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TSA acts worse and worse,False," I have been flying in and out of COS for years, and over the years the TSA acts worse and worse, they act rude and no common courtesy what’s so ever. They stand there saying next, let’s go, hurry up, dont move this or that, you get scanned and they either say move, or I need to touch you more, and then still no kindness at all. They act like they have so much authority. I’ve had senior military leaders who speak better to people. They don’t deserve this position. Hire contractors who know how to speak to people professionally. TSA leadership needs to watch these people. Start treating people with a little respect!",1

2017-12-01,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,efficient and pleasant,False," I have flown into and out of the Colorado Springs twice a year since 2009. Each time, check in has been efficient and pleasant, the TSA agents have been very nice and observant, the airport has been clean and refreshment options have been pretty good. I was last there in October of 2017 and liked the fact that the piped in music in the waiting area was classic rock. I have a high opinion of the COS airport and don't mind at all flying in and out of it.",1
