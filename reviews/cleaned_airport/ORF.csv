2016-10-02,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,always a pleasurable experience,False," I have been flying out of/into Norfolk airport my whole life and have always had a pleasurable experience with it; this time was no different. The Southwest check-in agent was very friendly, as were the TSA employees at the checkpoint. My bag got flagged as a possible explosive, but luckily they figured out it wasn't. A major plus ORF has to offer is its new bathrooms, which were installed less than a year ago. These are sleek, modern, and well-maintained by airport staff. The terminal itself reflects the era it was built in, with smaller windows and lower ceilings than, say, SEA. Instead of inducing claustrophobia, though, it gives the entire a building a more ""cozy"" feeling. New seats at the gates with electrical outlets are also a major plus, allowing you to charge your phone while you wait for your plane. One downside of Norfolk International, though, is the WiFi. It is very hard to connect to and hardly works. Aside from that, though, this is a small, practical, no-frills airport that is impossible to get lost in and is located near the Norfolk Botanical Gardens (another positive).",1
