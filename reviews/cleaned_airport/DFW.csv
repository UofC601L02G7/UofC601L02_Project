2024-08-22,0.8,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,I truly felt cared for,False," The wheelchair attendant verified everything for me! Verified with me, verified with the LYFT driver by asking his name, verify the LYFT ride by licenses plate, verified I felt ok and I knew where I was going. For me, it's humiliating to be pushed in a wheelchair. I never felt humiliation this time. I truly felt cared for. This trip wasn't the greatest vacay I've had but when I got home, I felt great. I want to thank this positive, smart, caring young man. Some ppl have a gift, a few share it in this way. If your lucky enough to meet this young man at DFW Airport, you'll know it's him I'm talking about here.",1
2024-07-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,airport is also very outdated,False,"   Absolutely horrible experience! Hardly no staff working the lanes in customs, a line in security closed as people were trying to go through, the entire staff was extremely rude. The airport is also very outdated and set up very inconvenient and confusing.",-1
2024-07-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Time to do a major overhaul,False,   5 skytrains passed. Lots of people waiting. Horrible! Terminal C to terminal A wasn’t that long but really? One would think it’s efficient and quick- the airport was packed. Was good on the 80’s but more people travel. Time to do a major overhaul. Bathrooms were few and far they are tiny-3 or 4 stalls and 4 urinals so have to wait for someone else to get done before you can Will not be a choice in the future to fly through Dallas anytime soon,-1
2024-07-09,0.8,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,Terminals were clean,True,  What's not to like about DFW. You can park at any terminal and take the SkyLink to whichever terminal you're departing from. Departure from Terminal E and arrival at Terminal A. Parked across from Terminal E United Airlines gates. TSA-Pre took a little bit longer than usual to clear (10 minutes). Both Terminals A & E are spacious with plenty of shops and dining options. Terminals were clean.,1
2024-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,4.0,"Very limited seating"" ",True,   Very limited seating while waiting for a flight. In addition it seems that all the flights are scheduled out of the same gate area which causes the congestion. Also has poor information on how to get from terminal to terminal. However when you do figure out how to get to the next terminal the tram is an easy experience.,-1
2024-05-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,This is the worst airport,True,  This is the worst airport. I am a solo blind traveler and always request a escort. I have never ever had one. Today i walk out and his buggy is full of 1 whom need assist and the others were family members. If you need special assistance bring someone with you because you most likely will not be the choosen few or better yet avoid this airport if possible.,-1
2024-04-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,never experienced a worse airport,False,"   Horrifying experience. We had a connecting flight in DFW to another US city and they forced us to go through customs, get our bags from baggage claim, recheck our bags and go through tsa security again. We requested wheelchair assistance and no one was there to help get us off the long ramp. All the disabled people had to walk to customs. We finally got someone to help us when we got to customs. Then they took over an hour to check in the wheelchair line. They closed off the general section and forced everyone able-bodied into the TSA pre check which defeats the whole purpose of pre check. When we finally got through security, we still had to wait longer with no shoes no phones waiting for the rest of our stuff. Then they didn’t let us bring in any of our duty free items because it didn’t fit in their tiny security scanner. Mind you everything was locked and wrapped properly in a duty-free security bag. Why on earth weren’t we told any restrictions before we even got to Dallas? So duty free is totally pointless when you’re forced to pay a fee to check in the items. All of that took over an hour and half and we almost missed our connecting flight. I’ve never experienced a worse airport in my life. I highly recommend avoiding any connecting flights to this airport or you will also experience a total nightmare. Edit: Forgot to mention that our connecting gate number was literally in the same terminal only 6 gates away. So we went through all this BS for a gate I could have literally walked to.",-1
2024-03-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,a horrible experience,True,"  We flew into DFW from Denver via Frontier Airlines on Friday March 1st without incident. Frontier delayed our flight coming home on Sunday March 3rd. We initially were supposed to take off around 930pm. We were notified that Frontier had delayed our flight due to crew regulations to take off now at 115am. We had family at the hotel in Dallas, so we stayed at the hotel rather than hang out at the airport. We arrived at DFW at 11pm. We checked our bag at the Frontier baggage counter and went to the security line. We were in line and walking toward the screening. The employees could see us. They quickly closed the door on us, even though I was talking with them. They did not respond to my greeting or my question of why they were closing the door on us! They ran away! We were not able to make our flight, even though our luggage was checked and we were in line! Is this how DFW values their passengers? This incident has created financial and incredible emotional stress. If I can ever help it, I will never fly into DFW again. It was a horrible experience. I tried to speak to another security guard and his response was to laugh at us! He treated us with scorn and open hostility and told us we were out of luck and to come back the next morning! Wow",-1
2024-02-28,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,3.0,2.0,Terribly long queues at immigration,False,"  Terribly long queues at immigration. Very inefficient system. Took longer than half an hour. Only 5 officers on duty for international checks. By comparison, London Heathrow Terminal 5 has over 20 including e-gates and it takes less than 5 minutes to go through.",-1
2024-02-26,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,,What's not to like,True,"  I don't understand the complaints about this airport. What's not to like about this airport. Parking is readily available across from whichever terminal you park in. Admittedly some garages lack elevators which can be inconvenient. Nonetheless, you can park in any terminal and take the shuttle between the terminals or the train between the terminal. On this particular trip, I flew out of terminal E. Found a parking spot directly across from one of the TSA checkpoint. As we didn't check luggage, we breezed through TSA Pre checkpoint and situated ourselves in the United Lounge. At this early departure, terminal was not crowded at all and the concourse are wide with plenty of windows giving views of the runways and airfield.",1
2024-01-29,0.2,Business,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,one of the worst airports in the US,False,"  DFW continues to be one of the worst airports in the US. Unfortunately, it is also my home airport so I spend a lot of time there. The terminal layouts are too spread out with often no possible way of walking between them. The train providing transports between terminals is adequate, but quite boring compared to other airports. Terminal services are hit or miss. Customer service mediocre at best. The parking garages are of an ancient design with no elevators or escalators except in Terminal D (the newest terminal at present) Which makes it very difficult to get luggage to the check in counters within the terminal. Other than Terminal D, the entire airport is very dated, inefficient and not up to the standards set by airports in more sophisticated parts of the world.",-1
2024-01-20,0.8,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,Terminal E my favorite terminal,True,"  Departure from Terminal E my favorite terminal. Given the midday departure, terminal was busy with plenty of seating available at the gates. Breezed through security with a minimal time thanks to TSA Pre privileges. Had a light lunch at TGIF which served very tasty and excellent food. One of the best features of DFW is the parking garages. I was able to find a spot in the garage opposite the Delta gates and to the TSA Entry Point. WiFi in both the restaurant and the gate was blazing fast.. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate. Lavatories were very clean.",1
2024-01-12,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,so ridiculously small and lacks so much,False,"  For such a busy airport it is so ridiculously small and lacks so much other international airports offer. There is minimal dining, cafes, shopping and anything that is there is mediocre. It’s a shame since they are continually under construction, at least since I’ve lived here the last 9 years, but nothing actually changes. Also, parking is terrible for such a busy airport. The design of the parking and terminals is silly and not commuter friendly, but nothing I. Texas is. You have to walk miles if you have to park in another terminal’s parking lot while your plane departs or returns to a different terminal. This happens a lot since AA is constantly moving gates right up until 15 mins before they land. This is not pleasant late at night in the dark and much of the airport is closed. You have to go outside and locate the bus which is difficult to find. I feel bad for visitors who get into this predicament. It’s better not to park there and get a ride. It’s actually easier to avoid AA and go with another airline.",-1
2023-11-01,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,"inefficient, and unfriendly airport",True,"  Don’t understand how DFW has one of the ugliest, most inefficient, and unfriendly airport. It’s reflective of its main airline - American. Rude TSA. Just an uninviting pile of concrete with poor food choices. Bathrooms are dirty and in ill repair.",-1
2023-10-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4.0,the terminal was not too busy,True," Departure from Terminal C. Usually Terminal C is very crowded; however, given the early hour of my outbound flight, the terminal was not too busy. Got through security with a minimal wait time courtesy of TSA Pre privileges. I can't rate any dining options as they were closed given my early departure 5:30 a.m. Inbound flight arrival was at Terminal E my favorite terminal. Both Terminal C and E have wide open concourses and plenty of dining options. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate. Lavatories were clean. I can't rate WiFi as I did not connect to it.",1
2023-08-24,0.3,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,TSA here has the nastiest attitude,True,"  TSA here has the nastiest attitude. Today I went through TSA coming in from Mexico, and had to go through security again. The young man at the front stays to leave my laptop uncovered. My bag got pushed out the line because of this, and the older man proceeded to jump into my mother and I’s conversation and said “you weren’t supposed to do that, you just weren’t listening”. He then proceeded to walk to the another man and started talking about me under his breath as if I wasn’t standing there watching him. I fly all the time and have never had TSA behave like that. He’s lucky I didn’t get a chance to see his name. I don’t recommend flying out of here at all, they lack respect for travelers, and organization. How dare him talk to a young lady like that and behave the way he did.",-1
2023-07-21,0.4,Business,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,,nastiest men’s room I have ever seen,True, Terminal C had the absolute nastiest men’s room I have ever seen in an airport! Pee on the floor and it stunk. Thankfully I only had to stand to do my business. I cannot imagine how bad the sitter stalls were.,-1
2023-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,I will avoid this airport,False,"  I have traveled through many USA airports and by far this airport is the worst. They are notorious for changing gate numbers at the last minute. Many times you go to the new gate, by the time you get there it is changed again. In my future travels I will avoid this airport even if I have to pay much more.",-1
2023-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Way too big an airport,False,  Absolutely ridiculous airport. Way too big an airport. Difficult to get around especially when you have to take the car service but still nearly miss your connecting flight. They make sure those with disabilities and special assistance are put last on purpose. It's a disgrace. I just don't understand because I about missed my flight to Oklahoma city due to the staff that just didn't care. This airport is a place that I would never want to return to for a connecting flight ever again. I'm very disgusted by Dallas-Ft. Worth international Airport.,-1
2023-06-14,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,security was a breeze,True," Departure from Terminal C. With TSA Pre, getting through security was a breeze with hardly any wait. Terminal C is not my favorite terminal simply because it is too crowded during busy departure teams. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate. Lavatories were clean. I can't rate WiFi as I did not connect to it.",1
2023-05-05,0.2,Family Leisure,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,not been cleaned for sometime,False," I normally do not take the time to review locations or items. But I was disheartened to see the condition of this airport. I will say first that the restrooms are very clean. However, the seating areas and the condition of some of the restaurants caused me to second guess eating here. I am currently seated in Gate A11 waiting for a flight to Tampa and as I sit here I can smell the carpet beneath me. It has not been cleaned for sometime. The seats need to be wiped off and the floors have a heavy collection of dust along the walls. I am not complaining. I'm writing in hope that a greater incentive will be given to the people that work here in order to take care and pride in the work they do. I've seen several cleaning carts roll by stopping only to conduct a few sweeps and then continuing on. Dallas if you take pride in this city take care of the first place people see when they come into your city.",-1
2023-05-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,5.0,changed gate numbers twice,False,"  My gate number has changed four times since I arrived from Key West, FL going to Denver, CO. Thank god we had a three hour layover or we never would have made it. Started in terminal D and changed gate numbers twice. Now I’m in terminal A gate number just changed again. This airport sucks!",-1
2023-03-09,1.0,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,5.0,He went above and beyond,False,"  Joshua Hu, was waiting for me with a wheelchair to get me to my connection flight, as I exited the airplane from Buffalo, New York. We were late due to American Airlines not  scheduling a Pilot to fly that flight at 6:50 am departure from Buffalo, New York to Dallas, Texas. Joshua  was amazing to make sure I made my connection flight to Albuquerque from Buffalo on March 6, 2023, scheduled to leave Buffalo at 6:50am, but didn't leave for over an hour late. He went above and beyond to accommodate me and my circumstance. If it weren't for Joshua I would never had made my connection and the extra travel time would have been detrimental on my physically disabled body and injuries. We ran into roadblocks, that included an elevator with cones around it. We finally made it up to get the train to the other terminal, where he was amazing to get me to the correct terminal and gate. Everyone was already boarding and the last was boarding. We made it in time. Thank you to God & thank you to Joshua for his diligence in making sure I caught that flight to get home and lay flat to help with the pain level, I experienced at the delays of American Airlines.",1
2023-03-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,Nightmare of an airport,True,"  Nightmare of an airport. Poorly designed, confusing and convoluted. Insane walk times even for those of us in shape (can't imagine how grandma would do). Rude staff. Avoid this Airport if possible.",-1
2023-03-04,0.2,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,1.0,Please avoid it,False,"  Two hours for a connecting flight, and still was not enough in this nightmare of airport. Airports are basically places where certain things happen at an exact time, so I don't know who got the idea to make this airport the slowest in the entire US. It is to me amazing that for connecting flights, you need to go to customs and then literally go outside the airport, and enter again, like if you have arrived at that precise moment.  The line of Customs is absurdly large, with some officers hitting on tourists. The airport has hired some red-jackets to ""redirect the traffic"". They basically don't really help. I was probably 1 h 30 min there. Then, when entering the airport and passing through security control again, after staying in the immense line and thinking of when the next flight was happening, a guy told me that if I pay 30 dollars I can skip the que, amazing as it sounds, I payed and I skip the whole que. Only to reach the door 15 minutes before where a rude American airlines woman told me that the boarding is closed, and that I cannot enter.  Please avoid it.",-1
2023-02-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,The terminals are very far apart,False,"  The Dallas/Fort Worth Airport apparently is quite huge. I did not anticipate how far the electric tram had to travel between terminals. The terminals are very far apart. I landed at a gate in terminal D. The connecting flight was to depart in 41 minutes, so boarding time left little room for error. A bathroom stop, a moment to get a paper, then purchase a snack for the plane, all at my arrival terminal (D) I did not realize shaved precious minutes off time to catch my connecting flight. The tram came quickly, but then seemed to go on forever. No recorded voice telling me what stop coincided with what gates contributed to my overshooting my stop by one stop (my gate was C-37, I could swear that never showed up on the screen above the tram doors). I caught another tram car headed in the other direction, which at the next stop did have my gate posted on the electronic sign above the door, went down the long, steep escalator, and ran to my gate. The staff had just closed the door to the gate. I showed them my boarding pass and asked if I could get in. I started feeling as though this couldn't be happening, I should have had plenty of time to reach my flight, but here I was. Fortunately, they let me in. I ran down the gangway thinking they might close the plane door in my face, got on the plane and did make it to my destination.",-1
2023-01-03,0.8,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,security was a breeze with hardly any wait,True," Departure from Terminal A. With TSA Pre, getting through security was a breeze with hardly any wait. Terminal A is brightly lit with a wide open concourse. Plenty of dining options. We lucked out with TGIF as it was directly across from our gate. Lavatories were clean but could be cleaner. I can't rate WiFi as I did not connect to it. Arrival from Cancun was at Terminal D. Given the lateness of our arrival, there were no queues at immigration/customs. Thanks to DFW Airport's Terminal Link service, we did not have to wait long for the shuttle to Terminal A where had parked our car. Lavatories in Terminal D were very clean.",1
2022-12-12,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,worst airport in the US to fly into,False,"  DFW remains the worst airport in the US to fly into. Here you can expect a delay of close to an hour after you arrive at baggage claim. If you ask questions about the ridiculous wait, you are met with apathy, hostility, and a complete lack of help.",-1
2022-11-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,I am so thankful,True,"  My flight into Dallas Ft Worth was delayed so I had a minimal amount of time to get to my connecting flight to Miami. Thankfully I had requested wheelchair service. The lady who took me, I am sorry I didn't get her name, was a sweet Asian lady, ran from terminal E to terminal A37. She literally ran, checking the time closely. She got to my gate with one minute to spare. I am so thankful that she was my wheelchair assistance, I don't think I could have gotten anyone better. Thank you sweet lady!",1
2022-10-24,0.3,Business,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,needs to maintain power outlets,False,  The airport needs to maintain power outlets provided for electronic charging. All of the outlets at Gate A11 were loose at the desk and seat outlets didn't work. This a safety hazard for shock or fire and annoying when you need to charge.,-1
2022-10-08,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,Terminal E is my favorite terminal,True,"  Terminal E is my favorite terminal at DFW. The concourse is wide with plenty of concessions (both shopping and eateries). Departure was during the peak evening travel period and the terminal wasn't very crowded. The lighting is very good as is the signage. The terminal is very clean and there is plenty of seating at the gates. There are several TSA Entry Points with signs indicating which entry points have less waiting time. United Airlines has a few gates here as does JetBlue and Delta. I was able to obtain a parking spot opposite entry point D17 which has a TSA Pre check point. As I spent time in the United Club, I did not utilize DFW's Wi-Fi connectivity.",1
2022-09-26,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,went above and beyond to help me,True,  I missed my connecting flight and I was confused as to whether my flight was updated to the next flight out to San Antonio. I asked a person at the gate if she could check to see if my flight was updated and she kindly looked into my flight status which was not good. She handed it over to her co-worker to see what he could do. He went above and beyond to help me get on a flight out that evening and I am forever grateful. They are top notch professionals. Thank you Jaqurel W and Anita McBride. You two are the best!,1
2022-09-25,0.5,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,1.0,3.0,my bag was apparently back in Dallas,True,"  A few minutes after exiting my plane, I received a gate change from terminal C way over to A. By this time, the gate attendants were gone. I rushed along the route and was finally able to snag a transit cart but did not make my connection. The cart dropped me at customer service where there was a line, including a man in a wheelchair and his relative who were in the same sinking boat as me. Since my arrival flight arrived a couple of minutes early, I was not given a hotel room. I was booked on the next flight to my destination which would not take off for 24-hrs. My destination was Connecticut, not some tiny, out-of-the-way airport. I asked and was told my checked bag would be waiting at BDL. 24 hours later, I finally made it home and my bag was apparently back in Dallas. Never will I travel that airline or use DFW!",-1
2022-09-24,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,4.0,This is one busy terminal,True,"  This is one busy terminal. On the day of our departure, the lounges had waits for 35-45 minutes whether you were a business class passenger or had a membership. There was plenty of seating available at the gates. The concourses are wide and have plenty of concessions. There is a long walk to passport control. The HVAC seemed to be working well as the arrivals hall and baggage claim were very comfortable. Using Mobile Passport Control, I was able to avoid the long lines and get through in less than 5 minutes. Unlike our last trip, baggage came out very quickly. Didn't have to wait no more than 15 minutes. WiFi was unreliable which is a surprise as I have never had issues with WiFI at DFW airport.",1
2022-09-20,0.1,Business,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,bars/restaurants gone to a tablet only system,False,"  Flew into Dallas with a 3 hour layover, easy enough to grab a few beers and a sandwich right? Wrong! It seems that all the bars/restaurants have gone to a tablet only system, oh wait you don't actually use the tablet you use your phone to scan the QR code to look up and order your food if you can find it. Can't leave your tab open, reorder every time. Worst system I have ever seen!",-1
2022-09-19,0.9,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,seems tidy and pleasant,False,"  This is my 2nd trip this year transitioning through DFW, both arriving and departing has been pretty good. Being a solo traveler with hidden disabilities, I'm grateful for the help from the DFW staff who were able to assist me from the plane to my next gate. Most staff I met are kind, friendly and got me to my gate with plenty of time to spare. The airport itself seems tidy and pleasant. Thank you for making my travel needs simple and less stressful.",1
2022-08-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Absolutely ridiculous planning,False,"  After boarding the plane, the airport needed to ""flip the runways"", meaning takeoff and landings needed to switch directions. Depending on weather conditions and traffic, I get it. What I don't get, is piling people in an airplane and then giving them no option for hours at a time. I'm a tall guy, sitting on an airplane is not comfortable, and any additional time sitting in those cramped seats can wreak havoc on my back and legs. 2 hours sitting on the tarmac with no movement, no refreshments, and no information is just barely short of kidnapping. Especially for the prices we pay to fly. Absolutely ridiculous planning, and even worse customer service. Unacceptable!",-1
2022-06-28,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,,1.0,,Terminal C is showing its age,True,"  Terminal C is DFW's oldest terminal and is showing its age. Upgrades are coming and they couldn't come any sooner. The concourse was very crowded and there was a lack of seating at the gate area. I was unable to connect to the free DFW Airport WiFi. The jetways to the aircraft seem to lack AC unlike some of the newer terminals at DFW. On arrival at gate C4, we couldn't exit the terminal building and had to go all the way to gate C17 which has 24 hour entry/exit.",1
2022-06-19,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,2.0,90 minutes to go half a mile,False,"  Is this a joke? A major international airport that is reliant on a slow, late, overcrowded shuttle bus system to get from one terminal to another? It took an hour and a half to go from the C4 bag claim to A10 where you can catch a bus. 90 minutes to go half a mile. I spent longer waiting in this airport, my destination, than I did in BWI and O'Hare, combined.",-1
2022-06-11,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,1.0,About ready to never fly out of DFW again,False,"  If you fly Delta and have a flight early in the morning you have to show up at least 2 hrs before to get a place in line because Delta employees show up and open the counter less than 45 min before scheduled departures every day. Its a disaster every single time, tons of people miss flights every day just because Delta won't bring counter employees in soon enough to actually get passengers checked in. About ready to never fly out of DFW again on Delta. Wonder if all of the airlines suck this bad early in the morning. This puts the employees in a horrible situation every single day and you think the airline would not want this kind stress and chaos every single day.",-1
2022-05-27,0.6,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,4.0,,Baggage Claim was disappointing,True, Departed from Terminal E (United). Renovated 5 years ago with open and light field space. The concourse are wide and have plenty of concessions. The bathrooms have a lighting system which indicates whether a stall is occupied or unoccupied much like that in the parking garages. Arrived at Terminal D from Istanbul. There's a long walk to passport control. Passport Control took no more than 15 minutes. Baggage Claim was disappointing. The AC appeared to be not working as it was very warm. Baggage took almost an hour to be brought up and the luggage came out on two different adjacent carousels.,1
2022-04-22,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Unfortunately a bad experience at Dallas airport,False,"  Unfortunately a bad experience at Dallas airport. From the review, this is a more common problem, which we also experienced today. We had a layover and had to continue after Cancun where we had 1 hour and 50 minutes. Due to the occupation at customs, it took too long after reporting to the staff several times, no action is taken to help. Immediately after flying we walked on to stand in line. After missing the flight, went after the service desk, no empathy was shown by the staff. Where they could still salvage something from the bad experience. If no solution was found, and the people from the service desk blame it on the government. The reputation has now been damaged where there were solutions to soften the notion, something of a comfortable place to sleep. If it is not possible to do this stopover, please do not offer it as this is a common problem.",-1

And to find the pre TSA ask 4 people that works their basically just rude and didn’t answer and just point saying that way. Pointed at a direction all of them pointed different way. The staff there don’t really care and some people saw me and said oh that was helpful. Basically saying what kind of answer was that, how rude didn’t stop just kept on walking. The TSA officer I had to deal with was just talking to passengers like we were just stupid and very rude. I hope I never stop there.",-1
2022-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,I would stay away from DFW at this time,False,"  I am writing this review as a warning to others: transiting through DFW as a foreigner is absolute hell. It is chaos, stressful and inefficient and on top of that now also sort of useless as our passports were not even checked upon reaching the front of the line, we were simply waved through. We transited from international to international twice and the waiting time was close to 3 hours both ways. With just 1 or 2 officers serving the line (and for certain intervals none at all as the officers led passengers to secondary) of up to 500 arriving foreigners it was pure agony to see the time tick away realizing soon our connections would be lost. The foreigners section is shared with the wheelchair passengers and I have never seen so many wheelchair passengers in my life, only when those lines clear an additional officer will serve the waiting foreigners. The previously installed machines where you would do your passport reading, photo and fingerprints are gone, so that option of - sort of - fast tracking is no longer available. And mind you, we are still far away from pre-covid travel volumes. I can only imagine what the situation will be like further in the season. Oh and one more thing, customs is also gone, so that saves you some time. My advice: do not plan any connections under 5 hours. Apart from this, I find DFW a pleasant airport, once you are airside things are spacious, calm and organized. Retail wasn't quite fully operational but the offer seems solid. I especially like entering through the B-terminal that is small scale, with quick and easy security. Once you are in you can reach every terminal quick and easy using the train. Entering the USA as a foreigner has always been hit or miss depending on travel volumes but I would stay away from DFW at this time.",-1
2022-03-10,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,quite literally the worst US airport,True,"  This is quite literally the worst US airport I've ever been to, and I've been to a few and they're all bad. I'm not fussed on all the opportunities for shopping personally, I just want to be able to get through the airport quickly and efficiently. This airport seems designed to keep you trapped inside. Not only is it badly designed from an architectural and passenger processing standpoint, TSA and US Customs checkpoints will take over an hour to pass through without fail. I highly recommend if you arrive at this airport to expect a 2 hour wait to clear customs. If you are departing, expect 1 hour delay for the TSA.",-1
2022-03-07,0.1,Family Leisure,,,,1.0,,,,,toll booths are not at all staffed,False,"  The toll booths toll road going out of the airport are not at all staffed so if you get up to the booth and there is a problem, there is no one to help.

2022-01-05,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,Baggage delivery was also very poor,True," I will not ever travel through airports like Dallas or any major US Airports like this ever again after this last trip. Worst airport ever. If you want WiFi, you need to pass security first before access it. Immigration is even very long and not so many immigration counters were open. Baggage delivery was also very poor. Airport was also less cleaned. I believe American standards has been in decline for a long time. JAL service was also bad much as this airport too. The next time when I travel, I will try my best to never fly through this airport again and I will also avoid flying JAL and next time, I will fly another airlines like Emirates, Qatar etc when flying from Indonesia.",-1
2021-12-04,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This airport baggage claim is completely garbage!,True," This airport baggage claim is completely garbage! I flew in to Memphis, TN from Dallas, and they lost my baggage and wasn’t aware I made it to Memphis last night. There is literally a computer system tracking where the passenger is going and it wasn’t applied. I had to get a BSO attendant in Memphis to call the BSO in Dallas just so the attendant can put my bag on the plane herself. I have military clothing and items in my bag that are irreplaceable. I have my moms wedding where I walk her down the aisle and I haven't prepped my uniform. The early flight was going to Memphis and arrive at 10am its 11am now and got put on the second flight. Do your job! Somebody please brief sternly to the workers because they are subpar in their only job to put a bag on an airplane. Its not rocket science. Anybody viewing this review make sure you keep your bags with you. You cannot trust the simplistic worker. I even confirm with my AA representative that my bag was put in the plane and she said yes. What a lie - fix this issue.",-1
2021-10-12,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,,2.0,terrible experience on the Terminal Link busses,True,"  I had a terrible experience on the Terminal Link busses tonight. I landed in terminal C. I took an A & B bus trying to get to B6 where my car was parked. The bus went to A first and everyone got off except me. I said that I needed to go to B and he said to get on the bus behind him and that it was going to B. I got on the 2nd B & D bus and it went B first. It stopped at the first B stop for the higher numbered gates. He told me that my stop was next. After a few minutes of winding roads, I asked him if he skipped my B6 stop. He said, oh, yes I did. I had to travel on to D and then get on a 3rd bus that took me back to B. It took me 1 hour to get from terminal C to my car that was parked in terminal B! What a cluster. I will not be parking at the terminal again. Drivers are clueless.",1

One took me to the right skyline and rode with me to my stop. One saw I was confused how to get out to find my car and gave me the assistance #. One stayed on the phone with me when I couldn't find my car and was exhausted and panicked. She found my exact parking space and led me to it even while I was distraught.

2021-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,1.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,I witnessed zero enforcement of federal mask laws,False,  I witnessed zero enforcement of federal mask laws in this airport (August 2021). It's a cesspool of disease and rude people without masks. My 11 month old can't wear a mask. He relies on others to follow and enforce the rules and they failed him. Spend the extra few hundred dollars and have your layover at another airport in a region where they take public health seriously. You'll be glad you did.,-1
2021-08-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never coming back to this airport,True,"  I'm never coming back to this airport if I can help it.  Even a 4-5 hour layover might be cutting it close. The TSA here are the worst people I've ever encountered in air travel.  First time through TSA they not only rescanned my bag 3 times, but over 20+ people were waiting for their bags to be checked/rescanned. TSA agents kept saying that the picture was cut off and they were only allowed to rescan the tray. Hand checking not allowed. I suggested after the 3rd re-scan attempt, if they could please separate the tray as it seemed it being overloaded was causing issues with the scanner or if they could use another x ray machine. The TSA agent looked at me and said that was not possible and that the only way was to rescan it...again. I repeated myself because I just couldn't believe they didn't understand what I was saying, that the tray was too full and it might be better to split it into two trays. He took that as aggression and in turn chose to escalate the situation by saying ""you keep repeating yourself"" in a certain tone. Unfortunately, people need to repeat themselves when the other person doesn't understand a simple question. Not my fault you don't have basic comprehension skills. I noticed that there was a lady that seemed to be the head and I politely asked her if it was possible to split my tray up next time it comes up to be scanned. She reluctantly agreed. And it went through. Something that could have been resolved immediately with what you would assume be experience and knowledge doing the job. 45 mins of waiting around for that. Anyway, the skytram sucks. It takes about 30 mins or more to get to another terminal. The airport is so large, yet disorganized you really have to know where you're going if you want to make your connecting flight. On the way back from my trip, we got delayed (again because of how disorganized DFW operations is) and only had 40 mins to make it to our connecting flight in another terminal. TSA was NOT helpful in getting us expedited through security although it we were not at fault for the rush. I've seen other airports rush connecting flights through TSA if they were pressed for time, but they did not care at all. I asked the TSA agent at TSA precheck if he could please let us through so we can make our connecting flight, he said no. I then said what do you expect me to do to make this flight, and he said I needed to get in line or ask the 300+ people waiting in the security line to cut in front. So I did exactly that. I turned around to the line of 300+ people and yelled ""I apologize, but this TSA agent won't let me pass through without asking all of you if it's ok to cut in line, again I apologize but my connecting flight leaves in 30mins and I wont make it if I can't cut right now"" No one objected and I went through. No thanks to TSA.",-1
2021-08-04,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Security was worse,False,  I had never flown from this Airport. I checked in no line the lady at the checkin for flight was rude had a attitude ask her question she almost screamed. Security was worse like you were wasting their time. The only helpful person was another customer behind me explaining how things worked. I am not a seasonal flyer haven't flown in years. I will never use Dallas Fort-Worth or the American airlines again .,-1
2021-07-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,There is no meaningful signage,False,"  I will never use this airport for arrivals or departures again. It took over an hour after we landed to get my luggage. And then it took about 30 minutes to get to the car rental terminal. In order to go back to the airport to pick up my family flying in on a different flight, I found I needed to know exactly which gate they were arriving into. That meant I had to wait for them to land and get off the plane. My plan was to park and go inside to help them with their luggage and the babies. But since I had no idea where to go before they landed, I barely was able to even get to the correct terminal and gate before they were trying to collect baggage by themselves - 2 babies and a mom. There is no meaningful signage to direct a person to car rental return location. And I asked 3 different employees how to get there - 2 Terminal Link drivers and a TSA agent who just happened to be on his lunch break, thank goodness. The 2 Terminal Link drivers had no idea. The TSA agent said he was pretty sure I would have to exit the airport then turn around. He thought the car rental return location was only outside the airport. Considering I had been driving around for what seemed like a lifetime, I did as he recommended. But the signs only said “rentals,” not “car rental return.” I followed this sign and ended up in front of the car rental terminal, not the right place. At first the Hertz agents tried to direct me to get back in their vehicle and drive somewhere else. I lost it. The agents then whispered to themselves - probably deciding if they needed the men to bring the white suits - but then one of them agreed to look at the vehicle and drive it to the correct location herself. I can’t say how much I appreciated that, I was so supremely frustrated at that point. But, seriously, never again will I put myself through this frustration.",-1
2021-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,disappointed with their attitude,True,"  We arrived and missed a flight due to long lines at immigration. Our family got in another long line at guest services, as we just stepped out to purchase a drink while we waited. We got directed to TSA and they were extremely rude and talked back in an ugly way. We went back to get our Boarding passes (with missed flight time) went BACK to TSA and in their words they didn’t wanna deal with that situation and we could not even go back inside with the only boarding passes we had at the moment. Very disappointed with their attitude and how they handled the situation after traveling ALL DAY. Not only were we the only ones with the same situation, another male as well as a kid getting left out here by himself.",-1
2021-06-17,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,The driver was very curt and drove too fast,False,"  I need a wheelchair to get through the airport and upon arrival from CMH a chair was waiting. When we got into the airport from the plane I had to get out of my chair and onto some kind of cart with 3 bench seats on each side. It was difficult stepping up onto the step to the bench seat. The seat was very narrow and did not have adequate hand holds. The driver was very curt and drove too fast for the amount of walking people, weaving around and making it hard to stay on the bench without sliding around. We arrived at an elevator and he told us to get off and go down and another cart would be waiting. We had to get off the cart and on to another cart. Then that driver did the same thing to us. Made us wait for another cart. Then a third cart arrived. At that point we chose not to get on that cart. I walked very slowly to our gate which thankfully wasn't very far. When someone needs a wheelchair it's because they can't walk far or not at all or their mobility is compromised. After we boarded our flight to Kona we had to exit the plane due to an electrical problem. When I exited the plane I told a flight attendant I needed a wheelchair. I waited outside the door for awhile and another attendant told me I needed to go back to the gate. I told her I needed a wheelchair. I ended up walking again back up the ramp where we waited 2 hours while the plane was being repaired. One of the gate attendants came and apologized and said they haven't been able to hire enough people. This was the worst experience I've had at any airport since I have had to use a wheelchair when flying.",-1

2021-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,the worst airport in America,False,  Once again this airport keeps its standing as the worst airport in America. Half hour lightning storm has now shut down airport for going on it’s third hour. Circled for 44 minutes sat out on tarmac for another 40 minutes and now no bags for 90 minutes and counting. Already have a hotel because these idiots can’t put you within half hour of your gate from the one you arrive in ever. Bigger and busier airports never run like this one. Avoid at all costs. Never again for me . I’ll pay more money to go elsewhere.,-1
2021-05-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,They have no customer service skills,False,  The staff here at Dallas Fort-Worth were completely rude! They have no customer service skills. When there is already rain and weather delays you would think they would be helpful but no they were completely rude and want you to go to a customer service center that line is a mile long. Has workers at a gate doing nothing but doesn’t want to help anyone. Just keeps running away and sending people to customer service. American Airlines is definitely not hiring quality that’s for sure.,-1

Last time it took 10 min just to get someone to let us off the plane and we missed our connecting flight be 3 minutes and they wouldn't open the door with the plane still there. Whoever is in charge should get fired! We are now sitting in Seattle trying to get back to San Antonio and guess what? We're sitting in Seattle because DFW is holding us. Again! I'll never use this airport for anything again! We are going to miss our connecting flight again! Thanks DFW!,-1
2020-12-27,0.8,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,I would definitely recommend this airport,True," Construction of a portion of the runway/taxiway caused a much longer taxiing time to the gate. Additionally, the layout of the taxiway caused another delay as the aircraft in front of ours was unable to move and we could not manoeuvre around. Inside the airport, however, was a different story. The SkyTrain was very quick and easy to access. We were in our departure terminal within minutes. The food options were quite diverse. Terminal C featured a TGI Friday, Chick-fil-a, Auntie Annie's, Pizza Hut, and McDonald's. I had never seen this many chain brands at an airport and was satisfied with the choices. Power outlets were available at certain spots, and some seats had footrests, which I have never seen before. The airport has good wifi and all other necessities needed even for a long layover, if you had to have a connection, I would definitely recommend this airport.",1
2020-09-27,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,the agent was very compassionate,False,"  I was at the customer service counter to try to get on an earlier flight. I observed another lady quite upset, after handling my issue, which was resolved quite adequately. I went over to the station where the lady was in distress. I asked the agent, what was the issue, and if the lady needed help. The lady could only speak Spanish, and crying so it was hard for the agent to get at the crux of her problem. After sorting it out, she didn't have the funds to get a new COVID test for entrance into Guatemala, (Guatemala has changed their requirements). Anyway, the agent was very compassionate and spent as much time as needed to explain and help her to understand what she needed. I had inquired if I could help, some things, of course, could not be corrected by me, but this situation. I could help. She just needed money for the test. The American Agent, explained in Spanish to the lady and that I was going to help her with the funds. I am sure that this lady would still be at the Dallas airport if not for the help of the American agent that took the time to help her.",1

Before we even got to them they were yelling and getting annoyed with people to get their boarding pass and ID out way before they even got to the front. Rushing everyone. Then we were making sure we had the proper stuff out of our bags and we asked to make sure and the guys says ""well if you would listen to what I'm saying you'd know."" Wow. Then another person got mad because our bag wasn't catching on the belt and the lady started yelling at us! If you hate your job so much leave.

Sky track was very easy to get to and use. Washrooms were clean and well maintained. Our best experience was the fact it had fast food restaurants. Our other airports we went to had high end sit down restaurants which were slow and kiosks where you paid ten dollars for a simple sandwiche. Very happy!,1
2020-03-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,Worst experience with TSA ever,False,"  Worst experience with TSA ever. We arrived at the airport and needed to make a connecting flight. Our carry on was flagged, the only thing that was in it was an Aero bed (an electric inflatable air mattress). Funny how we had no problem with it going through security for our previous flight a few hours earlier. 4 of your TSA workers thought it was a big joke that we were going to miss our flight because no one was there to check bags that had been set aside and were having a great time laughing and joking instead of actually working. Loved how our suitcase was manhandled when finally checked, and when we arrived at our destination after two flights, driving, being up all day and helping family pack up their belongings in preparing to move in the morning, our bed which we planned to sleep on tonight won’t hold air.

2020-02-23,0.9,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Just know the system and its absolutely fine,True," My usual entry point into the US on Qantas. Now the flight from Sydney gets in at 1pm so the customs and immigration formalities are completely painless (usually). That means straight to the machines, swipe the passport and check finger prints and to the usually very pleasant (he was) officer who asks purpose of visit. Being a regular visitor and departing on time always, this is a cursory look and smile. From departing the aircraft to pulling up at a local airport hotel took all of 45 minutes. Now compare to LAX. Terminal D is my departure point also. Now being dropped off at the curb to entering the terminal proper via a check in and TSA process took all of 10 minutes. A big thank you to the Qantas desk for the upgrade. The TSA checks were painless. You just have to know what to take off (shoes, belt, bulky clothing) or out (personal toiletries, laptop) or leave behind (water). Folks it is not that hard. Just know the system and its absolutely fine. The TSA have a job to to so work with them. Terminal D is a fine place. Very large and lot of places to eat and sit. One thing I think a terminal of this size needs is a decent bookstore. There used to be one but now has become very small and added to a coffee shop. I dont eat in the terminal as I have lounge access but plenty of choice. A trip to 7/11 to load up on snacks. The WiFi in terminal is fine also. Superb experience all round at DFW.",1
2020-02-20,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,this airport is a nightmare,False,"  Operationally, this airport is a nightmare. Statistically, there's a certain number of bags that need to be reviewed manually. This airport took every other back out and hand searched it. There were probably 30 people waiting for their bags to be manually searched after already waiting in the security like for 1hr + (some with flights about to leave). When they took out my liquids (which were correctly packaged and had previously gone through Logan's airport security no problem) they slammed the ziploc on the counter, broke a couple of products inside of the bag and as I'm trying to put the products into the bag they provided, they are yelling at me telling me I need to move quicker going as far as taking products out of my hand and forcibly grabbing the bag out of my had and shoving the open bag in my carry on where the broken product then spilled all over the contents of said carry on. I have never been treated this way going through security. Definitely the worst airport experience I have ever had.",-1
2020-01-08,0.6,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,a great and frustrating airport,True," I don't know how many times I've flown into and out, and transited through, DFW in the last several years. I semi-joke that one has to transit through DFW to get to either Heaven or Hell, as one can easily see all walks of life represented in the customers in this airport. Heck, I even saw Trace Adkins (American country music star) standing around one time. But honestly, DFW is a great and frustrating airport simultaneously, I like it, but I neither love nor hate it. Despite its size, the terminals are all very well connected by a very modern tram, and are very modern and clean, yet each terminal feels like it's the size of the City of Fort Worth and often requires much walking once in the terminal. For another catch, the personnel in this airport lean toward the friendly side overall, but you never know if you're going to catch that one airline staff member who just enjoys barking at their customers (I'm looking at you, American Airlines!), or that one TSA officer who can't get over their breakup with their significant other last month. Personnel are either very helpful, or have the worst attitudes, and there isn't a lot of in-between. Aesthetically, this airport provides a beautiful, spacious, ""Texas-sized"" introduction to visitors to Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, and the USA altogether. However, while signage anywhere you need to go within the terminals and around the airport property is ample, it can still be a chore to finally reach the always-slow baggage claim, then the car rental facility, or light rail (again, because of those long tram rides and long walks to anywhere). Lastly, as this airport is in the Dallas area, there's usually either a pushy nouveau-riche soccer mom or a testosterone-fueled redneck who doesn't travel much, who is impatiently trying to push ahead of other people in the airport, whether to order a burger, check a bag, or get on the plane. Something about Dallas, I tell you. This airport does much to make you go, ""Wow!"", before rendering you with such a mixed reaction.",1
2020-01-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,you either get barked at or mumbled at,True," I am so sick of TSA agents acting like they’re not employees. No one is on the same page, you either get barked at or mumbled at, and I find it annoying when they won’t even address you. A woman tried to move me through security with her eyes and then got upset when I wasn’t following her non verbal cues. However, I noticed she had no trouble speaking clearly to the gentleman after me or in assisting him with luggage retrieval. Please stop acting like your agents priorities are safety (it would be one thing if they actually took care of that), they are, instead, simply rude and this bunch would rather be surly, roll their eyes, and not speak or direct traffic. Even another agent was having trouble getting an answer from agents who were clearly new and didn’t know what they were doing during screening. Dallas Love is miles better.",-1

I understand it’s hard to clean an airport that has flights going in and out 24/7 but Mccarran Airport in Vegas probably has close to the same volume of people and manages to keep the place spotless. These people with the cleaning carts just aimlessly walk around and don’t make an effort. Cleanliness should be a top priority.,-1
2019-11-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,the most unfriendly group of agents,False,"  I wanted to relay my experience with the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, especially as it pertains to the TSA. I’ve been all over the place and seen a lot of rude TSA individuals, however this bunch really have it down to a science. They were absolutely the most unfriendly group of agents that I’ve ever seen. This must be where TSA sends the most crotchety agents to retire. “Get your tickets out, we’re not standing here making you sandwiches!”, exclaimed the TSA jerk in the middle of the line. The only individual not barking orders was the drug sniffing dog. Truly a horrible representation of the airport and the US. I will never go through Dallas-Fort Worth again. They need to fix that bunch.",-1
2019-11-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,signs are horribly inaccurate,False," The signs are horribly inaccurate and don’t represent actual roads. I went to parking for Terminal E for gate 13 and it shows 4 roads, with the left lane-splitting into parking with a big P for gates 1-10 and 11-38. There are 3 roads. So I took the left lane that splits off into two roads and stayed on the right. Nope, apparently you take the middle lane and just stay there. Makes zero sense. Whoever mapped out these signs has a horrible sense of understanding what a person who is driving for the first time will choose when the sign shows essentially 4 paths but there are only 3, and the left lane states parking but you have to go in the middle lane.",-1

2019-11-07,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,worst terminal connecting buses,False," By far the worst terminal connecting buses ever!! I waited 45 mins for 1 bus to show for term A. When he arrived he said he has just started, but every other terminal bus came by, 1 even twice before this guy shows up. All the other drivers were trying to call him he wouldn’t even answer! Horrible customer service",-1

The baggage handling process at DFW is by far, the worst I’ve experienced, slow, priority bags processed like all others, inaccurate scanning, etc. Here’s the problem, there is nothing you can do about it!

2019-10-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,it utterly failed,True," This was my first experience with this airport. For a first impression, it utterly failed. It needs better signage. That would have completely altered this entire experience for the better. I tried parking in remote parking. I got turned around, twice, and was lucky it was not more. Remote parking is remote. Not quite Timbuktu, but by the time you figure out the signs, it feels similar. I ended up parking in the south remote parking. When I took the exit, there was a T in the road, and there was a sign that said this road this way, that road that way, and absolutely nothing about where I might find remote parking. Seriously. Nothing. I turned the wrong way, because I am an idiot sometimes, and Murphy has a law. Then the shuttle dropped me off at an elevator for E33 instead of E12. There was no signage for E12 anywhere. He said to go up the elevator and down the hall because he doesn’t stop down there. So I ran half a mile after the kiosk didn’t work (add on to all this I was later than planned, so couldn’t check-in at the kiosk to print my pass), and kept having to ask where it was I was going, as there were still no signs. I got my boarding pass and tried to find the right security. Those also are not signed. They make their employees answer the same questions all day every day from clueless people like me. I felt horrible. Angry (at myself and them). Frustrated. So frustrated. Stupid. Because DFW failed to properly communicate. They made it so difficult to have a smooth, calming experience. As a result, it shall take me a considerable amount of time to get this taste out of my mouth. Perhaps it will leave when they improve the usability of their signage. It would be such a simple fix! Until then, I shall try to find some redeeming quality. My fellow passengers seem nice. The sun is rising now, which looks quite beautiful. The temperature in here also seems decent. And there’s a pretty piece of bubble-like artwork at my gate that does a nice job of catching the eye.",-1
2019-10-08,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,,1.0,3.0,take lessons from functional airports,True, It’s my 3rd airport today and I wish Texas could take lessons from functional airports. Having to go completely out of the secure area to go back through sub-par security to catch a connection is bad. It’s the only airport that doesn’t allow water - most airports do a water check. Also where it eventually brings you up to enter they closed that station so we had to walk even further. After 3 flights in 12 hours it was aggravating. After using free WiFi today out of the country - I tried here to answer the survey. No go. Couldn’t connect obviously strings attached for free. It should be simple so foreigners can connect without needing to read in English.,-1
2019-08-14,1.0,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,a great place to arrive and depart from,True," There are so many negative reviews abut DFW that I wonder whether I'm at the same airport as some of those reviewers. It may be the other terminals are more perfunctory than Terminal D, international. In many trips through DFW I have not encountered a problem save the occasional wait at TSA security. Arrivals are a walk in the park. Like all security the world around, it becomes easy if you simply take your time, remove everything and just do what you are expected to do. No shouting or anger on either side. The food outlets in D are great although I have lounge access and so generally eat there. One thing missing is a good bookshop but that is being renovated and should be around soon. Compared to LAX and JFK, DFW is a paradise and in my view comparable to places like Changi and Hong Kong but without the crowds. What could be improved: DFW operator, please please put in a decent coffee shop so we don't have to put up with the brown stuff that masquerades as coffee. Otherwise a great place to arrive and depart from.",1
2019-07-31,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,a courteous manner costs nothing,True, I recently experienced one of the most aggressive and rude security experiences in all of my visits to the USA. I beeped coming through security and she yelled step out I didn’t understand so she got very loud and then yelled at my 14yr old who she had told to come through! I spoke to a supervisor but he also looked terrified of her. Such a shame when I had such a great impression of Dallas and Texans to have left under such a cloud. I fully understand that you are trying to keep people safe but a courteous manner costs nothing - not good to encourage visitors to Dallas area! So disappointing.,-1
2019-07-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,an extremely rude and overtly condescending manner,True," My flight was delayed due to an emergency on the runway, that’s fine, I know stuff happens and there is no one at fault. I was flying into Dallas to transit for out of country travel. Anyways, due to the emergency, I missed my connecting flight out of country. American Airlines gave me a hotel for the night and rescheduled my flight for the following day. I lost my scheduled car rental day, hotel and a tour on my first day of vacation. After I returned to customer service post-trip, I tried to talk with one of the reps and was given some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Any question I had without hesitation was met with a head shake under the dismissal of “we don’t take care of that, headquarters does”. This was done in an extremely rude and overtly condescending manner. It’s fine if there’s nothing to do, but at least offer some alternatives and don’t make the customers pull teeth to find out information. I will not likely be recommending American to any of my friends or family.",1
2019-07-25,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,so dirty it is unbelievable,False, I had a two hour layover at this airport.

2019-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,Never using this airport again,False,"  The pure laziness and indifference by the baggage handlers at the baggage claim is embarrassing. I was waiting for 30 minutes for an oversized item to be delivered through the baggage claim, while the baggage handler walked around aimlessly. When I went to the desk to ask where my baggage was because I was going to my miss my connecting flight, the gentleman at the desk went and checked and turned out the conveyor was not turned off, and asked the moping rock head why it was turned off he just shrugged his shoulders like the neanderthal he is. My baggage was literally right behind the screen and I missed my flight by 30 minutes. Never using this airport again.",-1
2019-06-27,0.3,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,the rudest I've ever experienced,False,  TSA has to be the rudest I've ever experienced. I've been to quite a few airports and this group of agents are nasty to everybody. They definitely need some better training.,1

It is difficult to believe that DFW has been designated as a highly rated international airport. We are from Minneapolis, and that is truly a first class airport! Things are actually maintained and work!",-1
2019-06-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,it was a very unpleasant experience,False,"  It had been a long time since I had a layover at DFW and unfortunately it was a very unpleasant experience. The American Airlines terminal there was disgusting. It was a Tuesday morning and the restrooms in the A10 terminal waiting area were filthy with hair and faeces on the floor. The boarding/waiting area carpet was loaded with trash, spilled drinks and pieces of food on chair seats and carpet. We did not see any person in the act of cleaning anywhere nearby. Shame on you AA and DFW for your lack of cleanliness for your airline customers.",-1
2019-06-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,experience was terrible,True,  The service is awful. 2 men in uniform in terminal D had accents and didn't seem to fully understand me when I asked for help finding American Airlines desk to obtain boarding pass. The AA desk was empty. Then the TSA lady at check-in was rude and unfriendly complaining to her colleague next to her how she disliked her job as she checked my pass. The TSA staff at the scanners gave little guidance and talked over me. I rarely travel by plane and this experience was terrible.,-1
2019-05-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Avoid if you can,False,"  My checked bag was accidentally taken by someone and the airport staff refused to help me retrieve it. I had to run across the whole airport myself to find it! The airport staff instructed me to exit through a set of doors and ensured that I’d be allowed back inside, which I was not. So I had to wait for my parents to arrive for 3 hours outside the airport. The American Airlines staff and baggage claim staff were as rude as could be as I kept my cool and was polite through the whole situation. Avoid if you can!",-1
2019-05-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,Really upsetting,True, I had a 5 am flight along with 28 other passengers and we all missed our flight and were given incorrect info at the security gate. We were told the only security gate that was open was the one that opened at 4:30 am. We then all missed our flight due to not getting through security in time. We are now all on standby for the next flight. Spending $1000 on a cruise out of Miami might not even happen now and will all go down the drain. Worst experience of my life. Really upsetting.,-1
2019-05-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,the worst experience I have had at DFW airport,False,"  Upon arrival at airport the instructions on the plane say to sign into mobile passport for faster customs checks. So we did this and have used these services before with no problems. We went to the line mobile passport just to be put in line with everyone else. Then moved to another line with even slower service. When the staff was asked why the mobile passport people had to go through the line. Nobody would answer the question and just say to stay right here. After getting through the line, I found another staff member and asked him the same question and he said ""just keep walking good bye"". So with no answer how am I suppose to know what to do next time. As an American citizen we are being led around by people that cant understand nor hold a conversation in English. We fly have flown American Airlines for a long time but things need to be corrected. I will be doing some comparisons with Southwest from now on. I dont normally leave reviews but this evening 5/16/19 coming in on AA1385 was the worst experience I have had at DFW airport.",-1
2019-05-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,1.0,Avoid this place if you can,False," Possibly the worst airport I have been to. Ridiculous entry arrangements. The automated system is marshalled by staff, many of whom can't speak English and those that do don't have a clue what is going on. When you finally clear the automated stuff you then queue for ages and then do the same stuff over with a over officious ""guard""who is basically a little man in an important uniform. Very rude. Whilst this long protracted chaos is unfolding they are playing on a loop a glossy video saying how welcome you are. Well it doesn't feel like it. Then comes the chaos of the bag reclaim you have been in security so long there are numerous flights per carousel and no indication of which one your bags may be on. The staff are generally lazy, non English speakers, unclear of what is going on and/or downright rude. Avoid this place if you can.",-1
2019-05-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,border patrol better than TSA,True," How is it that customs and border patrol have better service than the TSA and airport staff? The dog sniffer ran into me twice. I waited 10 minutes to have my bag checked. The lady who was supposed to be waving me through the metal detector treated the foreigners in front of me like animals. She was waving at them so indignantly I was horrified. I bet she would have reacted violently if someone had done that to her. Then, on our way to the gate, my friend was almost run over by the vehicle transporting people. To top it all off, they were broadcasting CNN. Give me a break!",-1
2019-04-18,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,TSA was a joke,False," Was flying through DFW from San Jose del Cabo to Chicago on April 1. We had an hour 45 min layover. There were approximately 400 people in the immigration area trying to get through three lines. TSA was a joke, very disorganized, slow, and TSA people standing around doing nothing. We were able to get through a TSA check at ORD quicker with three times the number of people in line on our way to Mexico. My husband waited 10+ minutes for someone to go through his bag, as it needed extra checking. We arrived at our gate to find to doors already closed. We were put on standby for the next/last flight to Chicago. There were 34 people on standby for that flight. My family did get to fly home that night but shame on American for overbooking all three of my flights on this trip.",-1
2019-03-18,0.2,Family Leisure,4.0,1.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,a whole different level of ick,True," We took our daughter into Terminal A this morning at 8:30 to check her in for her flight back to school. We entered through A15. As we walked up to the door, we were met by an overwhelming sewage stench. Once through the door, we saw people asleep on the chairs (one man with his pants down to his knees, thankfully, he was wearing underwear) and on the floor, they had been there for awhile. I don't think they were passengers, as they were far removed from baggage claim and ticketing. As far as I know, there was no weather - or airline-related reason for people to be sleeping in the terminal. My daughter reports that the sewage stench is prevalent at her gate (A15), so this isn't just an isolated situation. What's the deal, DFW? The airport suffers from lax housekeeping in general, but this is a whole different level of ick. Are the homeless allowed to sleep in the terminals? Is someone on the sewage thing? Dallas is a world class city with a third-world airport.",-1

I fly weekly and have never experienced the attitude like they have at DFW. I walked through security 1/28 – 7.44pm – Term A Gate 22 and asked about the new luggage bin system because I’ve never seen it. Security smarts off that it’s been here for a year and I need to fly more to be aware, unreal, then he continued to laugh and repeat to other flyers that I need to become more aware. It’s unreal to me how DFW allows security to act like this.",-1

Employees don’t communicate. Mass confusion. Whomever is in charge of the operation should be talked to. The time spent in line is not the issue. It’s when nobody knows where to go or what to do and when employees do not communicate clearly (or at all).",-1

2019-01-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Nothing makes sense,False," Dallas Fort-Worth airport was apparently built by low IQ imbeciles. Nothing makes sense, inside or outside. Driving to and from this airport is like getting castration without pain killer, every time. Just when you thought you're learned this atrocity they throw you a new curve. One time all roads and lanes to the airport were blocked, and no detour signs anywhere. Apparently we were supposed to leave our cars there at the barricades and walk to the airport, in the dark at 4:30 am. Yesterday I was picking passenger at terminal A. To get there I needed to go through parking garage?! Next, due to so much traffic at the curb side, and being night time, I didn't see my party after driving the entire length of the terminal A. I figured I'll just take the ""exit"" sign and loop around. Wrong, this took me clear out of the airport. As I was paying my toll and bitching to the attendant he told me I could take the immediate first left turn and go back in. OK, fine - except - I was at the stop sign and needed to cross 20 lanes of onrushing cars to get to the rightmost lanes on the entry side - the ones for people paying cash. I was never this scared - absolutely the worst, most retarded, demented architecture and infrastructure on this planet. Third world airports are better and easier to navigate. Unless you are in need of adrenaline rush, stay away from this excuse for the airport.",-1

Our flight was delayed over 1 and a half for “weather delays” when there was no forecasted rain for the day, not only that when we arrived at Dallas we missed our 8:30 flight due to delays.

We arrived from Jamaica and went through the customs process where we told a customs agent that we were going to miss our connection. There were six of us so she said there’s too many of you to let you in front of others and because there are so many of you they will hold the plane. Needless to say they did not and of course the airline did nothing to help us blaming a customs issue. Sadly this is not the first time I have missed a connecting international flight due to customs. The worst part was watching my 80 year old Mom trying to run to make the flight. Good job DFW.",-1

2018-11-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Horrible. Beyond horrible,False,"  Horrible. Beyond horrible. The worst travel experience of my life. Both my husband and I have travelled and flown quite a bit, but this was personally my first time flying through DFW and never, I repeat, never again! I usually fly Southwest because I love them as an airline and have always had great experiences with them, well to save on flights this time I chose American which meant flying out of DFW instead of Dallas Love. I’ll try to make this review as short as I can, but no guarantees considering the entire trip was horrible. First: Our flight left at 05.15 which meant boarding around 04.45. We got to the airport around 03.30. We had two children (2 years and 7 months) with us. Pretty sure there was only one counter area open that was checking bags. Thankfully though, we made it through there relatively quickly. Next is security/TSA. They didn’t even open their lines until almost 04.00. Okay, not a big deal, we were TSA precheck so still would have plenty of time. Nope. No TSA precheck open. So we had to go into the normal lane which was very long. Again, no big deal, we all have flights and we should be able to get through pretty quick, right? Nope. They had one, I repeat, one person checking IDs for both general and priority lines. One flipping person that was also taking her merry little time and then they had one line open to go through the security and have bags scanned for 2 long lines of people. Holy hell did we all barely move. Around 04.30-04.40 they finally started opening up TSA precheck line. We asked if we could jump to that line since we were TSA precheck. We were literally ignored and they walked by and let another long line of people come up and start through their line. We even had people in front of us asking if they would make their flights on time because they were needing to get to their gates for boarding. And they were ignored. Okay, now let’s jump to when we finally got up to go through security (around 04.40 when we needed to be boarding at 04.45): again, it’s me my husband and our two kids. Took forever to even get us through the scanners. We get through the metal detectors and now we have to wait for our bags and car seat. TSA pulls every one of our bags for a check. It’s probably because of the formula and kids snacks. Nope. They wiped everything down and then told us they had to open every single one of our ready to feed formulas to make sure they were actually formula. The formula was still sealed! And if you are at all familiar with RTF formula, once opened it goes to a short expiration date. So all of our formula for the trip now was being moved to a 24-48 hour expiration date assuming our cold packs kept the cooler cold enough, if it didn’t, they put all of our formula expiration to 1 hour. It’s not like we could find formula around the airport for him if he gets hungry since our formula is no longer good because you had to break all the seals! So here we are getting progressively more and more angry as we are also supposed to be boarding our flight at the other end of the airport. So I take the kids and start heading/running down to our gate while my husband waits for them to finish opening all of our formula up. We literally get to the gate as the last people to board. Never again!",-1

I told her he was my husband and I had both our boarding passes on my phone. She asked a second time. ""So you're together?"" When I nodded she said, ""Fine then scan it."" I scanned mine then went to show her his she again scolded again and said ""give me your thing"" in a hurried tone. I made a guess that she wanted my ID and I gave my ID slowly and at this point very irritatedly. She was rude and irritated at us.

",True," Finding the DART station for a train to downtown Dallas is confusing. I followed signs to “ground transportation” and was directed to a jitney and told to go to terminal A. The jitney driver was extremely unprofessional, did not announce information about stops, and yelled at me when I got off at the wrong terminal A stop. I was the only passenger boarding the train, which comes as no surprise given the difficulty in finding the train. Returning to the airport, I learned from another passenger that I could enter the airport at the train station and take the skylink to my terminal. Why isn’t skylink connection to DART listed clearly in airport signage? It is no wonder few people seem to take DART to downtown!",-1

2018-10-19,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,,difficult to find two seats,True," Long lines at both standard and Pre-check lines in terminal C. This apparently was due to construction. It seems as if it could have been planned better. The pre-check line spilled out of the queuing area halfway down the hall. Signage to get to the proper line was poor and required asking directions of personnel rather than simply following the signs. Despite arriving at the gate over an hour and a half early, it was difficult to find two seats together for my wife and I. I would not say that the airport was filthy but it certainly does not look as if it has been cleaned up, particularly in the gate areas.",-1

They were super efficient in retrieving it. Thank you too to the airline staff at a nearby counter who suggested airport police. By then I had tried the cleaning team, the lost property at several terminals, my own airline (who was boarding), and security. The staff suggested not to call the regular police but gave me the airport police number instead. The bag held my passport, airport police had recorded it but not paged me or liased with other departments, despite jet-lag memory fail I made my flight thanks to regular staff and am very grateful! PS Security trainee here gives overzealous pat downs as if ensuring all crevices are airtight and flightworthy. Avoid at all costs.",1
2018-09-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst airport I've been to,False,  Worst airport I've ever been to. Myself and a few others missed our flight because the airport concierge told us the directions to the wrong gate when I showed him our itineraries. We then proceeded to ask for help and no one that worked there would help us and talked to us like they had no clue as to what needed to be done to get another flight out. Have to purchase another plane ticket out for three days from now. Also extremely hard to navigate this airport. Even the parking lot attendant gave me wrong directions on how to get out of the airport! Extremely dissatisfied. Won't refund my money and was charged for my bags that I had to wind up carrying the entire time!,-1
2018-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,confusing to navigate,False,"  This is absolutely the worst airport I’ve ever had to use. It’s very difficult and confusing to navigate, directional signs inside and out are extremely vague. Decided to use valet parking because I was traveling with children and I had a broken arm. Valet is a joke! Made a valet reservation on the app and selected “yes” for the baggage assistance option. Pulled up to valet, was just stared at for a few seconds so I parked my own car! Then when I mentioned help with my luggage, the guy acted like he’d never heard of such a thing and asked what I wanted him to do because I’m just going “right there” as he pointed across the way to the airport! So not only did I have park my own car, but I had to trek the exact same distance as I would have if I just opted for self parking, and I’m trying to hold onto kids and drag a 50 lb suitcase to the terminal with a broken arm!! All while being charged $31/day! Upon return, my car had never even been moved. This lack of service cost me a total of $205! Someone please explain to me how this is valet? Contacted customer service, the guy said he couldn’t help me but would pass this on to his manager and she would call me back that day, that was four days ago. Regardless of the valet issue, DFW is awful, majority of employees I’ve encountered are rude, and everything about the airport makes travel very stressful. Dalas Love Field airport is my preference. Everything is easy and flows so smoothly there and all areas of customer service are wonderful!",-1

Process was painful with those that were in charge of the lines and no throughput ideas. The Mobile Pass line was the slowest, when we finally got to the immigration officer he asked us for our passports. I thought the idea was ""mobile"" passport. I did not see why he needed to check these with as other cities do not. He also was very nice but painfully slow with chit chat. We were trying to make a connecting flight and wanted to just get they immigration. Those in charge need dedicated Mobile Pass lanes. There were families leaving Mobile Pass and going into the kiosk lanes as those moved quicker. Process improvement needed desperately.",-1

The bathrooms smell and appear to never be cleaned beyond wiping the countertop and the toilets. The rental car return is beyond confusing. On the way to return my car I passed two areas for my rental agency that we’re not for the return. It is disorganized chaos, but it does have a great app that helps you to navigate the airport and track flights. Also there is only one area with tsa pre check in each terminal so regardless of where you think your gate is, you will likely have to trek to a different area to use pre check.",-1
2018-05-12,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,the most poorly organized airport,True," Perhaps the most poorly organized airport I have ever been to, and that includes airports from countries in the third world. Everyone knows TSA is slow, but at DFW they take that already high standard and push it even higher. The lines are abysmal. Worry not - staff seems well aware, and they try to speed up the lines by frequently redirecting passengers to other lines. This is where my negative experience begins. A lady in Orange redirected about the last 30 if us to ""TSA Pre-Check"", verbatim. ""Go down the hall to TSA Pre-Check"", she said. A a result we all moseyed our way down to the pre-check line and the line was not short, but it was moving unlike the previous one (when a line doesn't move for 15 min, something is wrong). Those in the group told to move all waited at pre-check until we were at the very front, and only then did a man start yelling at folks that the line was for ""TSA Pre-Check only"", when the lady in Orange clearly told us to wait in that line. Nevertheless we were all relocated to yet another endlessly long line. No signs to mark the line, no staff to usher people to the proper line, and no announcements were made at the appropriate time. As you can guess, many of us missed our flights as a result. This is my second negative experience at DFW, and the reason I felt compelled to leave a review. Everyone understands that security takes time, however DFW abuses that understanding greatly. Sadly one doesn't have much of a choice when choosing an airport , but I'd avoid DFW if given the option. It's not the amount of people that's the issue, it's the rate that they process those people and apparent lack of organization/communication. So congrats DFW, to being one of the largest, and most poorly operated airports in the world.",-1

Are you closing this area? How about a sign near the other gates that once you come over here you will have nothing. Thanks Dallas - one of the largest airports in the world. Unbelievable!",1
2018-05-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,,,,1.0,this one is by far the worst,True,"  Of all the airports I've been in, this one is by far the worst! 5 terminals spread out over an unbelievable amount of land, signs that lead you in one direction only to stop giving you directions, and, above all extremely rude staff. Rental car return area is a 2-3 mile bus ride, understaffed, and again, extremely rude. People driving the busses both to and from the terminals didn't speak very good English, and though I tried to explain that I was leaving out of terminal B, was assured that the terminal E bus would get me there as he took my bag and loaded it - it didn't go to B. No one at terminals to help. Ended up paying a shuttle driver $40 to take me to B. One TSA check point for 30 or 40 gates, combined with bad information, almost caused me to miss my flight even though I pulled in to car return 2 hours before my flight was scheduled. The sign that led to nowhere led me to a door that said ""no re-entry"" once you pass through. I opened the door and stuck my head out to see where I was only to yelled at by a security lady. She threatened me stating I had to come on out even though my entire body (minus my head) was still inside the door. When I tried to ask where I needed to be the yelling got worse. To the point she threatened to have me arrested if I didn't come on through. I've never been treated as rudely at an airport as I was at this one. Never again will I use this airport.",-1

Escalator was broken and some lethargically applied signage confused the passengers about how to navigate. Overall signage approaching the airport is terrible, especially the rental car return route. Signs have you exiting one stop prior to when you should for rental car return. Rental car shuttles are too long between busses. No excuse for the place being dirty though.",-1

The support staff do not appear to have any clue of what they are doing and I saw them being rude to several passengers. On the plus side, the immigration and customs guys were great and professional though the lines were long as they had only three counters open to cope with many passengers who were arriving through several flights. I am not sure why they could not open more counters. It was worse on return. Coming back from Mexico, all of us missed the connecting flight to Doha as the lines were even longer, thanks to the American Airlines officer at the airlines desk counter, she managed to get us on the next day direct flight to Doha. My question is as to why transit passengers who do not wish to enter the US are not processed quicker and without needing to go out of the airport, like in most other international airports? I had an entry visa but was not intending to enter the US at all. This would simplify matters really.",-1

Then you are treated like criminals by very nasty employees who do not know what they are doing and should not be employed in those positions as they kept sending people to the wrong lines causing more delay and problems to the arriving passengers, with a lot of them missing their connecting flights. Then your are forced to exit the security area and go again through security to get to your connecting flight. I hope the management of the international arrival at terminal D look at this and try to improve the service which on March 12 was a real disaster and nightmare. I have been in business more than 40 years with many employees, if I see any employee of mine treating the customers the way the arriving passenger were treate , I would fire them on the spot together with the manager.",-1

Im not happy paying almost $800 for a round trip ticket and I'm sitting here in the airport for another 4 hours before I can leave. This is the third time this has happened to me in this airport. Delayed for 4 more hours. How much money do you people think we have to spend at the airport to arrive at are destination on time? I feel like they do it to make more money when they have plenty of it. I'm not happy at all with the service.,-1
2018-01-12,0.9,Business,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,one of the easiest airports for connections,True," I fly weekly for business, and for the past year I've been flying on American from Michigan to California. I connect semi-regularly through DFW - makes sense, as it's American's headquarters and largest hub. I'll say right here that I love connecting through DFW. It is one of the easiest airports for connections that I've ever experienced. The concourses are wide and open, seldom choked by clusters of boarding passengers. The physical layout of the concourses minimizes the need for airplanes to wait on the tarmac ""for traffic to clear the alley,"" as happens at other airports like O'Hare. Best of all, the SkyTrain at DFW absolutely flies, and can connect you from one corner of the airport to the farthest other corner in about 9 minutes. I'll accept a tighter connect at DFW than I will almost anywhere else, because of that SkyTrain. Dining at DFW is varied and generally good. B Terminal is a little skimpy, but otherwise I have no complaints. Restrooms are generally large enough for the number of travelers, and generally clean. I've had loo-oong layovers, and have walked the entirety of all terminals at DFW...and can report that they are basically all consistently good and competent. The biggest detractor I can find is that there's no airport WiFi. At least, I haven't ever found one to sign into. I agree with a previous reviewer that a lot of the hateful reviews must come from passengers who are generally unaware of the requirements of modern air travel (which is okay; not everyone flies weekly like I do) but don't want to admit when they've made a mistake.

We arrived at the automated desks to put our esta details through and received a receipt, if you have an x on this there is additional security which is fair enough but when 5 out of 6 of the same party are put in that queue, bear in mind there was over 100 people in this queue and only 3 desks open out of a possible 20 desks that isnt good enough. I asked a member of staff as to why there are no staff on to deal with the amount of people in the queue I got a shrug of the shoulders and told to move, they were not interested in the fact we were going to miss our connection because of this and we were not the only ones this happened to. Once through, which had taken well over an hour to get through, we had missed our connection. Went to the American Airlines desk as we had missed our connection to be told there are no more flights tonight and would have to fly at 07.04am the next day, I told the lady that we would require a hotel for the night for the 6 of us, was told as we flew in on a BA flight we would have to see them in regards to that. I kindly told the lady that American Airlines is part of the same alliance as British Airways and would she call them to do so, eventually we were given a hotel and were told to go upstairs to the BA desk where they were waiting for us. Surprise they knew nothing about it, so took our passports went into an office and we waited over 20 minutes for them to give us voucher for this. I will unless necessary for the customer avoid going through Dallas again.",-1

",True," Appallingly organized airport. An hour waiting in line for the so-called 'automatic passport system', which then did not work, so a further 40 minutes for a human being to rescue the system. Very bad-tempered staff who were surly and rude. The Customs and Passport officers themselves were great. No complaints there.

As a frequent flyer I can attest that the negative reviews come from nervous, irritated or clueless travelers that can’t follow basic instructions. No you can’t bring the water, yes you must remove your shoes, no a knife is a knife no matter what size it is, priority means priority not general boarding, etc. I have to say I haven’t really been to too many airports where the fault is with the airport it is always the rude travelers. Why everyone flying feels like the only reason they are there is because their private jet is being worked on is beyond me. Travelers, just smile, relax ask the TSA agent how his day has been going and you will get through security quickly and stress free. You must also remember that if you had to deal with so many jerks on a daily basis that your temper might be a bit elevated. Let’s just take a breath, board and get on with our lives.",1

For an airport of this scale, you’d think they knew how to organize things better but they don’t. Lines are beyond ridiculously long, and security check personnel (those who look at your passport and ask about your bags and those who inspect your bag after the X-ray) are completely hateful and treat you like they are above you and you are just cattle.

FInally many of us were sent to the wrong line, the green line, for those who do not have checked baggage,. By the time we realized this, we were out in the terminal and not able to claim baggage and transfer to connecting flight. Tracking baggage was an additional nightmare.

My experience with DFW was by far the worst airport experience of my life. The TSA personnel at the security check in treated us no less than like basic trainees first entering the armed forces! We were constantly yelled and treated like kindergarteners. At one point an officer told the woman in from of me in a very rude tone to remove her jacket and put it on the conveyor. When I followed suit and removed mine, he yelled at me telling me that he didn't tell me to remove my jacket. Do as you are told, he yelled. Very, very rude people and a very disturbing experience. I've only touched the surface of all that happened during the check in. The rudeness was so widespread among the staff that I feel that it is definitely a reflection of a serious leadership problem with the TSA at the airport, or at least that portion of the terminal.",-1

For years now, I have tried to avoid parking here at all costs. Shuttle bus service is erratic, and drivers routinely ignore passengers waiting. Lot attendants are typically rude and standoffish. Unfortunately on my last trip, there was no Uber available at 4am, and I had to drive and park at DFW. When I returned to DFW a week later, the Remote South bus pulled up near the stop, the driver looked at me as I waved, and just continued on. This has happened to me multiple times over the past two years, either in the lot or at the terminal pickup stop. Drivers stare at you, ignore, and roll on by. This time I had to wait another 15 minutes in 100 degree heat with my wife and two young children. DFW may be well run in some areas, but their parking/transportation departments are dreadful.

A regular entry point from Sydney. Usual arrival is mid afternoon and it is a breeze to get through immigration control, pick up bags and recheck for the onward. Qantas arrive at Terminal D and usually out of Terminal A to pick up an American Airlines flight. Quick trip on the light rail and you are there. On the last trip it was in reverse. Arrive at Terminal A, out of D. There was 90 minutes between flights but enough time to get to the Admirals Lounge at TD, quick freshen up and out. Although the Qantas flight left at 10 pm, it was very quiet in Terminal D and many of the shops were winding down for the night but still found a couple of places to pick up some snacks. When a review only complains about how quiet it is and not much happened then that's a pretty good review.",1
2017-05-22,0.4,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,the employees are not friendly,False,"  What a ridiculous experience. Generally, DFW is ok as far as airports go. The construction can make things difficult, but I appreciate their attempts to stay up to date. It's sheer size can make navigating difficult, but it's one of the largest airports in the US, so that is to be expected. Here's my biggest consistent problem with DFW: the employees are not friendly. Many of them are downright rude. Sure, there are a few random friendly faces, but vast majority of people you interact with act like you're stupid and like they have about 50 other things they could be doing instead of helping you. This is such a huge disappointment to me as a Texan because we are known for our friendly, welcoming demeanor. I hate to think that those mannerless jerks are the first impression people traveling in from other states or countries experience. I have never been spoken to by a stranger they way those people speak to you, it's disgraceful. Every single one of them ought to be ashamed of themselves and ought to have their hides tanned by their parents, since that clearly wasn't done enough in their childhood. Manners matter people! Today, however, was a nightmare. We flew back to DFW after a vacation in Mexico. We were told our baggage would come out at carousel 5. We waited for nearly 45 minutes before a fellow passenger - not employee - noticed bags coming out 3 terminals away. No announcement was made over the loudspeakers that are everywhere, no information was shown on the screens in the baggage claim area, they just let us sit there and watch an empty carousel. There were also 2 other flights that came in behind us and got their luggage first. That was the first thing that frustrated me to death. Then, just before a handful more flights got in, they decided to close half of the immigration stands. It took us an hour and a half to get our bags and get through immigration. We are American citizens traveling back to our home country, there is no reason it should have taken that long. Shame on you, DFW. You have disappointed me too many times for me to finally not say something for others to see.",-1

2017-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,experience absolutely terrible,False," My daughter and I traveled from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth for a connecting flight to Phoenix Sky Harbor. The experience at this airport was absolutely terrible. Our flight from London to start arrived 26 min late. We were informed by the crew that passengers with connecting flights leaving within 2 hours to grab a ""orange tag"" upon leaving plane so that we could be expedited through customs and baggage recheck. Also we were told to quickly get to customs since another large flight was landing as well. There were no orange tags for us to grab. When we arrived to customs section, it was complete chaos. I asked 2 employees where we were to go and that we were supposed to be supplied these orange tags to expedite us to our connecting flight which was leaving in less than an hour and 15 min. We had to wait in a long and spiraling line. In the middle of this, a border control agent announces that we could get through customs if we signed in through our mobile phones. By the time my daughter got to the ""questions"" portion, we were already at automated customs check. Then we had to wait at baggage carousel for a lengthy amount of time. Once retrieved, we had to go into another extremely long and spiraling line for connecting flights and bag recheck. Again I told an employee that our flight was leaving in less than an hour and about the ""orange expedite tag."" And again told to wait in long line. When we got further in, I spoke to another employee, told her ""our story"" again, she immediately sent us to another line which, I believe Global Entry. She specifically sent us to the shorter of these 2 lines. Once up to that desk, the person proceeded to argue with us that we should have been in the other line next to it. We told him we were sent to it by the other employee. He was so rude, nasty, and did not listen to anything that we said. And on top of that, he marked our tickets with an A, for agriculture. We didn't have any kind of food in our luggage and told him that, so because of that ""mark"" we had to go to another line to get our luggage scanned. By the time we got through that line, with again telling employees ""our story"" and that our tickets shouldn't have been marked for agriculture since we had no food, we had less than 20 min to make our flight and our luggage was still not collected. After finally dropping our luggage off , we had to take a skyline to the other end of the airport. We finally made it to our gate at exactly our departure time, in which the employee told us that we had just made it and to hurry onto flight. We will never choose to fly into this airport again. Obviously a lot more employees and well-trained at that, are needed at each of the sections and a better system needs to be in place.",-1

Easily made it through TSA, and had no problems finding my gate. I wish I would not have chosen American Airlines. They ran an hour late due to some type of problem. That was no fault of DFW.

Will avoid DFW at all costs for future travel. This was a shocking experience for transit between international and domestic AA flights. With 1.5hrs between arrival and departure, we arrived on time and felt comfortable. We'd been informed new immigration procedures were in place but the on board arrivals video was not that clear and it only got worse on disembarking. Eventually we figured we could go through the automated passport channel which required us to scan our passport and green card and then collect print out. I was referred for 2nd inspection which didn't take much time although on entering the baggage claim area, it was sheer chaos. After collecting our bags the queue to get through a 2nd immigration channel snaked through the whole of half of the baggage reclaim area, moving at snails pace, causing many travellers, including ourselves much stress, and no options for fast track even with tight connection times. Lines were not clearly signed and caused uncertainty for travellers. Abrasive and officious CBP Officer did little for the ""welcome to the USA"" experience. Next challenge - rechecking bag for domestic leg. Bags everywhere, with 3 people trying their best to put bags on the conveyor. Pushed ours to the front in order to ensure they had some chance of making the now very tight connection. And then of course the next security check which again was plagued by queues and confusion over a new policy that means there are no bins to put things in to and no requirements to take out PC etc. and take off belt and shoes. This wasn't explained at the approach. A quick sprint for our family of 5 meant we made the gate with 5 mins to spare before doors closed. The DFW transit took a ridiculous and extremely stressful 1hr 15mins.",-1

As an American who has lived and worked abroad for the past 13 years and has traveled through major hubs all over the world, I had one of my worst experiences to date at DFW when flying from Puerto Vallarta to Charlotte, arriving January 11, 2017 around 5.00 pm. I was stuck along with thousands of other passengers in immigration and customs for 2 hours and would have missed my connecting flight had it not been delayed by 40 minutes. American Airlines claims their reservation system safely factors clearance times into their scheduling. This is not true as I and many others found out. There were many passengers around me who were told that they had already missed their connecting flights when they rechecked their bags following customs clearance. There were no airport employees visible in the baggage claim area to direct the multitudes and there were many immigration stations and TSA security lanes that were closed at what appears to have been the busiest period of the day. I ran into one AA flight attendant in the crowd who was just as bewildered as the wandering masses! The capacity is available, but employees need to be hired and scheduled for peak times. From my experience, management at DFW is doing a very poor job. I have already cancelled future flights I had booked through the international terminal at DFW.",-1
2017-01-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,baggage claim is too slow,False,  Baggage claim is too slow - waited for over 30 minutes after our flight landed to get our luggage. Flew 1st class with our bags tagged priority and they were some of the last bags off. Thought I paid for a service. The temperature in the baggage claim area was also extremely unpleasant. The inside should still be cool even if it is unseasonanly warm.,-1
