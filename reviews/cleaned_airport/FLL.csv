2024-08-17,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,grown to hate this airport,False,"  I have grown to hate this airport. First and foremost, when folks are stuck here for hours on end waiting for their connecting flight or rushing to make their connection, the LAST thing we want to hear are your obnoxious and loud recorded messages about everything there is to do in Florida.  God forbid you try to focus on something else or get some semblance of peace because FLL airport will ensure it does not happen. Are you sitting at gate G2 waiting to board a flight? You, too, will hear messages about why you shouldn't park your car in the unloading area! You will not get peace in this airport and must deal with rude airport employees. Very disappointing.",-1
2024-03-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,4,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,the worst airport I’ve been in,False,  This was the worst airport I’ve been in. We got there 5 hours before our flight so could not check our baggage yet. No seating in this area so we had to sit on the floor - I’m 81 years old so this was quite uncomfortable. When i was able to check luggage in the man was very rude. Told me I should have gotten my luggage tag. i thought that’s what he was supposed to do.,-1
2024-01-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,,"terminal 1 is spacious, brightly lit"" ",True,"  This was my 2nd flight to FLL in 4 months after a 11 year absence. This review is limited to Terminal 1. Arrival was at the A Concourse gates 1-5 which mean a rather long connectors to the B/C concourses common area. One huge advantage of FLL airport over the others is the car rental facility which is directly across the airport roadway from the terminal. The renovated terminal 1 is spacious, brightly lit, and has a central TSA Entry point for all 3 concourses. Each concourse offers dining options a plenty. For Christmas Day travel, there was enough seating for all with power ports and USB ports at each gate. The bathrooms are very clean and maintained at regular intervals. Security was a breeze with no wait time for the TSA-Pre checkpoints. WiFi was easy to connect too and blazing fast. The refurbished Terminal 1 is a joy to travel through",1

2023-11-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,“airport attendants did not care at all”,True," Our flight arrived on time, but the airport was unable to receive the plane. We had sit again and wait in the plane. Then, they told us that they had no resources to unload the baggages from the plane and we had to wait another hour. Finally, there are way more travelers than what the customs could manage and we had to wait in the side and then we were moved to the line. Because of that we lost our connecting flight. We had 3 hours between arrival and departure which is normally more than enough for a so small airport. The airport is accepting much more flight than they can manage and the customers are who suffer only. The airport attendants did not care at all. In consequence we had to stay the night at the airport outside the security area with nothing to eat and no where comfortable where to seat. They were not willing to lay anything because they said it was a “uncontrollable” situation. We booked the flight a month ago so they knew how many flights were arriving, it was not an uncontrollable surprise. If I can control it I’ll never fly through Fort Lauderdale airport again.",-1
2023-09-07,0.9,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,,refurbished terminal a significant upgrade,True," It's been 11 years since I traveled through Terminal 1. The refurbished Terminal 1 is a world class modern airport terminal. It is spacious, brightly lit with plenty of seating and dining options aplenty. There are oodles of power ports and USB ports at the gates; however, some of the power ports were not working. Bathrooms are very clean. The concourses are wide and directions easy to follow to baggage claim. Security was a breeze with no wait time for the TSA-Pre checkpoints. WiFi was easy to connect too and blazing fast. The refurbished terminal is a significant upgrade to the old terminal 1.",1

Then, TSA pre-check and regular are in the same line for F Concourse! And regular line is backed up to easily before where you enter TSA Pre-Check. No waiting at TSA Pre-check line! Terminal 3. TSA has the entrance to TSA Precheck blocked off so that you have to wait in the regular line for 10 minutes before you can get to clear or TSA Precheck entrance.",1
2023-04-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"closed for the past two days"" ",True,"  Avoid Ft Lauderdale Airport like the plague. I would give this airport negative 5 stars. I had a flight out of Ft Lauderdale today to Cancun to celebrate my 50th birthday with a large group of close friends in Tulum. It’s been raining in all of south Florida for past three days, and due to this, Ft. Lauderdale Airport has closed for the past two days including today. I can understand weather being a major issue resulting in airport closures, but somehow Ft Lauderdale airport is the only airport that has closed. They are currently close and ironically it’s been sunny all day. All of my friends were able to fly out of Miami International Airport which is a 30 minute drive to the south and somehow Miami International did not close at all. And Miami is extremely prone to flooding as it’s lower than Ft. Lauderdale. West Palm Beach airport which is just to the north did not close either. So needless to say, all of my friends are celebrating my 50th in Tulum without me because the airport will not open till tomorrow with the airline not being able to book me another flight for next three days. Worst part is as we are all sitting in the airport waiting for some news, airport staff had no idea what was going on or when they would reopen. I will never fly out of there, heaven forbid it rains a little again and the airport is shut down for a week. What did Miami and West Palm Beach airports figure out what to do that Ft. Lauderdale couldn’t.",-1
2023-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Unbelievable waiting times,True,"  Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is a total shambles. Unbelievable waiting times to park the plane, to access the luggage area and another two hours for customs and immigration. It really is a disgrace to treat visitors like this. I travel a lot globally and this is much  worse than countries the US really does not want to be compared to. In Houston two weeks ago this thing ran extremely smoothly.",-1
2022-12-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,missing connecting flights due to flight delays,True," My first plane landed 45 late. They did not open door for another 10 min saying other planes are waiting. Then we were supposed to go through customs, but the guy letting people into customs area was not allowing anyone except those with global entry to go through customs. I showed him my next boarding pass and told him I am boarding now. He said there is not room for me and held me for 20 min standing before allowing to enter customs area. But he allowed those with global entry to enter. How come there is space for them but not for those who are missing connecting flights due to flight delays? This was very very rude. I missed a flight of course and had to spend a night in a cold hotel. I lost desire to fly with American Airlines. What is going on at the airports in USA is totally unacceptable.",-1
2022-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,1,4,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,This is really disrespectful and unfair,True," Every time I use the Southwest terminal I find a couple of flights arriving, so hundreds of passengers waiting to go through the Custom's process and there are always two or three agents but no more. This is really disrespectful and unfair after traveling.",1
2022-06-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,"TSA agents are rude, unprofessional and this entire process is ridiculous",True," Absolute worst for layovers for international traveling. Our flight arrived 20 min early, only to have to wait for 25 minutes on the plane due to customs not being ready for us. The flight attendant said on intercom if you are changing flights to put the liquor you just bought into your checked luggage, because the TSA agents like to drink. I thought she was joking. Well when we finally got off the flight, we were held in a hallway for 40 minutes until we were allowed to go claim our luggage to take through customs. (Which took 90 min) After that, you have to check your luggage back in. I asked if we should put the liquor we just got from DR in the luggage and was told no, not if it’s sealed. Then we get to security and we’re told we can’t keep the liquor. I tell them to call down to the people we checked luggage in because we asked. First man says let it through. Second guy scans it and tells us either we surrender it, or let him re test it in a machine, but if it fails, my husband and all our belongings will be taken to another room for a recheck and a full body pat down. I think the flight attendant was trying to warn people. That they take your liquor here for their own use. 2 hours later, still trying to get our flight. TSA agents are rude, unprofessional and this entire process is ridiculous. Never again will I do a layover flight here.",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Incompetent, unprofessional staff",True," The absolute worst service! Currently at airport as I wait online with 2 family members. Spirit decides to keep us inside a turned off airplane, no air circulating, no notice but that the airport is not ready to take us in. Not considering connecting flights and having to do immigration, this was an international flight. Gets better before even getting through immigration we were forced to collect our luggage...what! We have connecting flights are you kidding! On too of having to take our luggage, they are extremely damaged! Every single one of our suitcases were destroyed and mishandled! Than they take you only in small groups because the line to immigration is overwhelming and they can’t fit enough people, leaving our connecting flight with less than hour! Explain to me how this is normal. Incompetent, unprofessional staff goes on to tell us the next flight they can put us in will be tomorrow at the same time so 24 hours we have to wait in an airport because they will not accommodate a hotel because it wasn’t Spirit’s fault it was the airport and immigration! I’m sorry I paid Spirit to get me home, not an airport. You quickly washed your hands, hand over a new boarding pass and call it a day! You call this service?",-1
2022-06-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this is the last time I will use this airport,False,"  Arrived from Cali Colombia with plenty of time to go through immigration. They had 5 agents for hundreds of people arriving. I spent 3 hours in a line and lost my connecting flight. Of course Spirit did not accommodate and had to spend $680 on a flight to get home. Worst experience ever, this is the last time I will use this airport, terrible experience!",-1
2022-05-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Unprepared staff at all levels,True, The worst airport ever. Unprepared staff at all levels. Customs picked on me because the picture of my passport was 5 years old and I looked different. I was taken to another room and the officers were abrupt and very rude. They made me show my Drivers License and finally after holding for a long time waiting and an exhausting trip another agent came and asked if it was me on the picture. I said yes and I said I just look older. After that they let me go.,-1

Shake shack was out of ice cream and burgers with a 35 minute wait line. Had a terrible portable mushroom burger (must have been deep fried cuz was greasy and gross). Didn't try Starbucks.,1
2022-04-09,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Would rather drive,False," Never seen this level of don't care, go somewhere else.

This is not right after the flight arrived, took 2 hours to get out the airport, for a family with kids this is not working. Please someone do something to help us.",-1
2022-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,did not hurry about anything,False," There needs to be a law against this level of abuse of passengers. After getting off the plane we were all led to a room where we stood in a serpentine line, for a full hour. Finally, we were led to a place where we could get out bags, which took forever to show up on the carousel, even though the plane had landed over an hour ago. At this point we stood in another line, with our bags, waiting to go through immigration. This line wrapped all around the entire airport, and took another full hour to get through. After that, you have to recheck your bag, then wait in ANOTHER line for someone to check your passport. Then there is yet another line, this one you go through security allá over again. They did not get in any hurry about anything - in fact, it really did appear as if they were trying to take as long as possible on purpose. All of this took more than 2 hours, and I barely made my connecting flight. The plane was about to pull away from the gate, when a super nice airlines employee called them and stopped it so that I could get on. Needless to say, I ordered a drink as soon as possible once in the air. Is there no one who oversees airports, or the way they operate? The only thing they could possibly have made it worse is if they had strip-searched me and beaten me.",-1
2022-03-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,Worst airport in the USA,False,"  Worst airport in the USA. This is the second time I have used this Airport in a month. It appears as if international arrivals Airport staff want you to miss your connecting flights. They are unorganized (only a few staff actually do things to help). Then to add more misery to the problems TSA precheck was closed at 8pm on a Saturday. While waiting in the Immigration line many people were discussing how they have missed their flight due to excessively long wait times. I will never have this Airport on my itinerary. If I book a flight and see this Airport on it I will change carriers, change travel times or whatever is necessary to avoid landing here.",-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,This airport is not managed well at all,True," This airport is not managed well at all. Waited 20 mins to get a gate. Waited 20 mins to get the stroller at the jetway, arrived at 6.45pm and it is now 8.30 and we are still waiting on our luggage. Not clean no. Nobody to help you and no notice of what luggage carousel your luggage comes out on.",-1
2022-03-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,4,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,The worst airport ever,True,  The worst airport ever. Took 2hours to get through immigration they gave zero cares in the world . Such an antiquated system and airport. I like lots of people missed their flights there was no help no assistance just oh well its not us. Really you work at the airport. Never fly here it's a joke.,-1
2022-03-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,the worst airport I have ever flown through,False,"  This the worst airport I have ever flown through. This is my second time flying through this airport and each time it gets worst. I have seen so many people miss their flights. This airport is horrible any smart small business owner can fix the problems in the airport arrival procedures. Honestly if TSA think this how you solve America security, then I am disappointed to be an America. These lines are long and redundant, and they make absolutely no sense. It took us over 2 and half hours to make it through immigration. It makes the traveling experience horrible. You come back to your country and it's the worst entry system. I believe the only reason this is horrible is most of the international flights are coming from the Caribbean and South America. If these flights were coming from Europe, TSA will find solutions to make this airport entry very smooth. This another form of discrimination. TSA refuses to fix this problem because those flights are from third world countries.",-1
2022-02-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,2,1.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,avoid this airport as much as possible,False,"  The worst thing you can do when traveling internationally is to have these Mickey Mouse airport as your port of entry. They never know what they are doing. Going through customs is a mess. They never have any control of the two different lines, one for citizens and one for non-citizens, that will direct you to the proper federal agent. When you are done with customs, they make you go through the process of re-entering the airport as if you were doing it for the first time. You have to go through the x-ray machine, get padded down, have them go through your carry on and then hope that items that are safe to carry with you are not seen as unsafe by these bunch of idiots and get confiscated. For the individuals running this place common sense is not in their skills set. Apparently they have never heard of six-sigma. They don’t have to hire a black-belt to improve the process of making a connecting flight easier and not as stressful as they make it to be. My advice to you is to avoid this airport as much as possible. It has always been the same, organized confusion at its best.",-1
2022-01-24,0.3,Couple Leisure,4,5,4.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,2.0,Where were the guides?,True,"  I had traveled through Ft. Lauderdale international airport previously but did not recall the confusion. Having processed customs, coming from Bahamas, I did not see any information or helps on where to go next for my connecting flight. Did I miss the help desk? I carried my recovering wife’s luggage as well as mine all the way to terminal 3 after dragging it all around terminal one while looking for help. Ft Lauderdale is a clean, nice looking airport and I don’t mind the construction. However this exasperating experience left a dark cloud over the rest of my travel. Where were the guides?",-1

2021-10-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Unorganized and incompetent systems,False,"  Worst airport experience of all time. If I could give zero starts I would.

Broward county is a misery of politicians and Transportation department. Worst airport for immigration. They never seen to be in another airport before to learn. They should be all of them fired. Wait and staff is so incompetent and rude. Administration of the airport is the worst. Every single time I arrive at the airport it is a mess. Chaos through every line. Even mobile passport.,-1

I landed at 4:57pm waited 15/20 minutes for the airplane to open the door because the immigration line was packed. Once off was making the line which were 60/70 people in front of me mind you have my 6 year old son with me which he’s already hungry! They asked us to get out of line to get our bag, to make another line for customs! I have my connection flight which leaves at 8:40pm. They need to find a way to make this process faster and easier. If you have kids let them make a separate line, if they have a connecting flight that leaves within 2 hours make a line for those!",-1

Not only do you have to exit security, but you have to walk outside the get from one terminal to another. The do have a bus, but be aware if you're in terminal 4 and take the bus to 3, 2, or 1, it will take well over 30 minutes to get there. The bus stops and waits at least 10 minutes at every short term, long term, and rental car lot that they have. If you're lucky enough to transfer in the same terminal, be aware that none of them have a restaurant or bar worth anything. Chili's is about the best you'll find if it's open. I'm 70 y.o. and have flown all my life in and out of the USA. This is the worst airport I have even been to.",-1

I could not believe the mile long lines and wait times, total chaos. Even our bags were sent to the wrong area. Passengers were yelling because they were missing connecting flights and sheriffs had to get involved. I spoke with an employee and she mentioned it’s been this crazy for a few weeks. I suggest trying to fly out of MIA for international flights, it’s truly miserable at FLL.",-1

Lines are super long every single time. But usually the departure was easier, well, not this time. The line was so long that part of the time I had to wait outside in the sun while doing the line, and spent like an hour in line. The boarding process wasn’t very organized either and the gate didn’t seem to have much space. I hope they improve all of this.",-1

Besides being poorly designed, there was no where to get any food. There are lengthy lines everywhere, people are waiting to get food and then find out that you can order food to go with any of the restaurants that are on site in the terminal one. The design for the terminals for self parking is horrific. It has been this way for decades.",-1

You have no restaurants that are good for children. One is a Margaritaville, the other a whiskey bar. No place to grab a quick bite, like a MacDonalds or a Dunk-in doughnuts. Why you have a make-up store and a Sunglass Store I can not imagine. When we tried to plug in our electronics not one outlet was working. It is just not a well designed airport. We could have flown into Miami, next time we will.",-1

They had us go through so much more than what we have ever done at security and they had a rude tone.

Very rude and slow check in to even get your bags checked initially with Allegiant Airlines. I visited this airport 3/1/2020 at 4 am for a departing flight and decided to visit the auntie Anne’s inside of the airport and the girl working the counter acted like she couldn’t look up from her phone to answer a simple question. I asked her when they open and she was rude and condescending. She should be fired immediately for how she is acting. It’s a very bad look on the airport and auntie Anne’s. This isn’t the first time I’ve had this encounter at the same location! Please do something about the terrible customer service!,-1
2020-02-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,This airport is ridiculous,True," This airport is ridiculous. To change terminals we had to walk a mile to make it to our connecting flight. There was a bus but every employee told us it was too much trouble to find and bother with. So, with a baby, toddler and handicapped woman, we hiked to the next terminal. In addition to hiking a mile, you have to leave Security and go through it all again at the mile-away next terminal. That’s absurd. I did not believe any modern airport could be this difficult to navigate I would rate it a 0, 1 or whatever the lowest possible rating is.",-1

I missed my flight to NY and had to stay the night there because they took in flight by flight, meanwhile all the machines that are used to check in at customs were empty. I use mobile passport to get thru the line faster, and they made all of us using the app wait with everyone else. I mean what is the purpose of having the app. Then they put us on a line, and the officer did not accept mobile passport, so we were sent to another line. They need to have a better system for this, they are aware that several flights come in at the same time, it is not new to them. This is the second time this happens, and I heard a lot of people saying that mostly everyone misses their connecting flights due to customs. They also need more customs officers there, there were many empty cubicles. Very bad system they have there.",-1

2020-02-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Worst US airport experience ever,False,  Worst US airport experience ever! We are frequent flyers and have never experienced such rude and unprofessional treatment of passengers entering the country from Jamaica. My husband was in a wheelchair and wheelchair customers were moved over to the side in waiting stations. It took more than two hours to get though security. The attendant was loud and rude and constantly complaining. She was pushing my husband into other customers and knocking other customers out of the way with the baggage. Passengers in line with canes were yelled at to get out of line and another passenger became hysterical during the process. When we finally arrived at our gat and my husband tipped her. She opened her hand and spread out the bills counting them in front of everyone. Shame on FLL! This should never happen at a US airport.,-1
2020-01-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,most disgusting experience,False,"  Going through security was the most disgusting experience. My boyfriend had to give up his necklace with his best friends ashes in it. The extremely rude security women told him that he could go back in line for checking in our baggage to put the necklace in there, though with only 20 minutes to spare and the extreme wait on the lines from the incompetent employees, he would of missed his flight and would of had to wait and PAY for an entire other flight. How can you go home after work knowing that you’ve thrown away someone’s remains because the necklace “resembled a bullet”. Regardless of the fact that we were able to unlatch the necklace, show the remains and it had a religious prayer on it. Avoid airport at all cost.",-1
2020-01-19,0.2,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,1.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,spent 4 hours sitting on the floor of the airport,False,"  We were returning home from a cruise through the Fort Lauderdale airport. When we arrived at the airport early, we were told that we could not check in any earlier than 2 hours before our flight. We spent 4 hours sitting on the floor of the airport, along with over 100+ other travelers, before the Southwest Airlines representative would allow us to even check our luggage. The sign in the airport clearly stated that ‘Baggage May be checked up to 4 hours prior to departure’, yet we were shunned away and told we had to wait until 2 hours prior to departure. So you had a room filled with people sitting on the floor with their luggage because we were being told we could not check luggage until 2 hrs prior to departure when signs posted clearly stated the rule was 4 hrs before departure. I can provide a copy of the sign if needed.",-1
2019-12-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,2,1,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,This airport is nasty,True,  This airport is nasty. The floor where you sit has garbage on the floors and you see no one cleaning the area at all. The people at the counters are rude when you ask them a question. Never seen a airport that does not care about the upkeep. When you walk in the E area for gates it smells like old mopped water. Smell like mildew.,-1
2019-12-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst security staff I have ever seen,False,  Traveled all over the world. Worst security staff I have ever seen or experienced.

2019-11-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,employees were either rude or of no help at all,True," While traveling with 11 family members, my 85 year old mother was injured on an incoming international flight by a fellow passenger dropping luggage on her from an overhead bin. We asked for medical and security assistance on the plane, but none was provided. After de-boarding the plane, we were given a wheelchair. Family members were then instructed to proceed with the wheelchair through custom, through luggage pickup and then through luggage re-check, with little to no assistance. After luggage re-check, we were told we could  not take the wheelchair through TSA to our next gate without airport personnel's assistants. After waiting for over 30 minutes with 9 other wheelchair bound individuals and no one coming to assist, we finally found someone and begged them to help us make the next flight. We made it to the gate just before takeoff. With the exception of the lady that helped us make the gate, other employees were either rude or of no help at all. Even after asking airport security to help us file a report again, we were told to talk to the airline personnel. Not a good experience.",-1
2019-11-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,TSA was extremely rude,True," It took us two hours to go through security when they were only about 20 people ahead of us. TSA was extremely rude. When my mother, who is 80 years old, came up to go through the x-ray machine, they asked her how old she was? When she said she is 80, they virtually shoved her toward another lane and said: “you go here without any explanation.” We were then separated. And she stood there and waited for several minutes, feeling humiliated and shaken up until an attendant just came and let her through another gate. It is unacceptable.",-1
2019-10-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1.0,0.0,,,,staff were rude talking back,True,  My mother fell yesterday was unable to walk without cane assistance. This just took place yesterday upon arrival at Allegiant outside drop off I ask to men working United for help was told no. Then at Allegiant bag check in the lady said stand aside at 4:45 for a 6:00 flight boarding. After waiting 10 minutes and in fear of not making boarding due to lines at check point security and staff were rude talking back. I took it upon myself to get her in one. Now we have 2 personal bags and 2 paid checked carry on. I myself have had two back surgeries so I am struggling I passed 2  employees setting on a wall by Auntie Ann Pretzel on a wall just chilling. Asked them for help to be told that is not my job.,-1

But it seemed old and outdated, just basically not a pleasant place to be. Signs indicate that a major renovation is coming, so hopefully that will improve things.",-1
2019-09-15,0.3,Family Leisure,4,4,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,service at terminal 1 was awful,False,  I was in the airport helping my 90 year old mother to take a flight with Southwest Airlines. The service at terminal 1 was awful. I had to ask for a wheelchair because nobody came to help us. I also needed a baggage cart and none of the more than three baggage handlers moved to help. I had to walk to another entrance to get a cart and the guy there in a very disrespectful way requested $10 just to give me the cart and carry my luggage 20 feet. All the service personnel related to the outside entrance had no courtesy. I haven't ever seen such an impolite group of persons.,-1

It took over two and a half hours to get through at midnight. The staff here are in desperate need of training and the entire layout needs to be fixed. I will avoid fort Lauderdale airport for the rest of my life. Packed terminals that are dirty and insane traffic 24/7.",-1
2019-07-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,overcrowded lines,False," The worst, most disgusting airport I have ever been in. To the lines from the car drop off shuttle to the terminal, sweating outside waiting on a bus, to the kid stomping out the cockroach, to the three-hour delay on my flight, to the horrible choices for food, to the overcrowded lines literally everywhere! Not to mention the wifi is the worst!! To the shuffling of people like we are cattle. Awful!",-1
2019-07-29,0.3,Couple Leisure,1,3,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,do not bother with duty-free,False," We bought alcohol at the duty-free store and it was sealed by the store we were told it was ok to bring it with us. The moment we went through the checkpoint we were pulled to the side our bags were taken away and we had to wait for over an hour for the airport security to rip our bags open check the alcohol just to put it back the way we had it, of course, we missed our flight and were put on standby. Good advise, do not bother with the duty-free stores if you want to make your flight.",-1
2019-07-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Dirty and a dump,False,  Horrendous awful experience. Do not use this airport in South Florida! Use Miami or Palm Beach. Completely incompetent staff. Unreal delays. Dirty and a dump! The worst experience I have ever had at an airport.,-1
2019-07-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,a poor excuse for an airport,True," This is a poor excuse for an airport. I have travelled throughout many airports in the world and this ranks as one of the lowest. There was absolutely no thought or planning put into this thing. Getting to the airport is a hassle as the signs are terrible - especially if you are trying to return a rental car. The guys driving the shuttle buses to and from the rental car location are absolutely idiotic and do nothing but pander for tips. Hint - you can walk faster to your terminal than taking one these buses. The terminals are small, crowded with virtually no shopping and horrible restaurants. The security is a total joke - they make up the rules as I go along and act like Nazi's. I had one idiot tell me that I was wearing the wrong type of underwear for Florida. I am not so sure he just didn't want to pat down my crotch. My wife's purse went missing and security ended up doing an ""inspection"" of it. Our travel cash was in it and we aren't so sure that the guard wasn't trying to take some of it. The restaurants inside the gate are horrible with terrible service and food. This whole place is the lowest of the low. If you need to travel to the area do yourself a favour and go to the Miami Airport it is 100 times better than this monstrosity.",-1
2019-06-06,0.6,Solo Leisure,4,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,I do not appreciate the way that I was treated,True," At Fort Lauderdale airport, approximately around 5pm I was on my way to the entry point of the check point near terminal 3 to the right of the American Airlines kiosk. I was abruptly stopped and was aggressively asked “Where is your ID?” I proceeded to look for it in my bag. I usually get my ID out while I wait in the TSA line. He got more aggressive and said “Does this look like a game to you?” He then told me to check in my baggage. The same bag I was able to carry on with AA from DFW to Fort Lauderdale. When asked for his name, he claimed that his name is “Brian”. However when asked to see his badge, he would not comply. He continued to state “If you don’t like the way you’re being treated, go to a different airport”. I am filing a complaint, because I do not appreciate the way that I was treated. I also could’ve been late for my flight. This type of behavior is not suited to represent your airport. If he met someone more confrontational, they would’ve recorded it and all of this would be all over the news.",-1
2019-06-01,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,almost 3 hours at immigration,True,"  Fort Lauderdale Airport is the worst airport ever. We were left waiting for almost 3 hours at immigration, just to show our passports. And so were lots of other people, we will never return. Never again, ever!",-1
2019-05-13,0.3,Family Leisure,4,2,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,poor example of customer service,True," Being from a Royal Air Force Family, I have been flying in and out of airports for the last 60 years. Never in all that time have I been treated with such contempt and rudeness as I encountered at the pre security Cross Grain Brewhouse in terminal 4. We entered to find very few spare seats and one table for four occupied by one man. My husband who suffers from vestibular neuronitis (a problem with balance) took a seat at the table as he was feeling dizzy. My husband is a Royal Airforce Veteran. He then suffered a tirade from one of the servers who told him he couldn’t sit there until the person at the table had finished his meal. Told him it was rude to sit there and asked ‘who would do that’. She continued with her abuse to myself and my daughter and added that we could not just have drinks, this after making us wait some time for her attention. We are from the U.K., were unaware that it is not allowed to take a vacant seat. This is an international airport where people from around the world with different rules and regulations visit. This woman is a very poor example of customer service, a disgusting ambassador for the airport and America. She left our family extremely upset with her atrocious behaviour. We had just spent two weeks in Florida where until this incident we were treated with respect and great courtesy by everyone we met. They were friendly, and helpful. I hope we never come across her like again.",-1
2019-05-05,0.2,Business,2,4,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,What genius came up with this design,False,"  I live in FLL, this airport which has just had a lot of work completed is horrid. I dropped off a friend at terminal 3 a few days ago and at departures they have designed so there's no cover from the rain - this is a place that gets 6 months of thunderstorms a year. What genius came up with this design. The result - everyone sitting in their cars waiting for the torrential rain to stop before getting out to get their luggage out. Talk about adding to what is an airport already at capacity and backed up with check in and security - I blame Spirit Airlines for that. Another thing - there is no decent lounges - this is an area where wealthy people travel through all the time for cruises and yacht trips. I hate Miami airport but at least they have nice lounges there, FLL needs to catch up and sharpen their game. On top of that last time I was there I had no mobile signal (T-mobile) and their WIFI is awful. I go to central and South American and have better WIFI - this is the USA there's no excuse for that!",-1
2019-05-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airport I’ve ever flown into,False,"  Quite literally the worst airport I’ve ever flown into and I fly frequently for work. We had a layover in Fort Lauderdale and had to exit the airport to go to a different terminal to then re-enter and go through security again, and to top it off TSA wouldn’t let me go through precheck. Meanwhile my initial boarding pass is TSA precheck cleared and I showed the gate agent my TSA number, to which he rudely replied ‘this happens everyday’. If this is a daily occurrence how has this not been fixed yet!? Meanwhile we have to throw out all brand new drinks we bought at our first airport. Then my husband is stopped by security and has to throw out items that were already cleared through our first airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the world. Now sitting at the gate, the seats are covered in filth, trash is everywhere and there isn’t a single worker to be found cleaning the mess. I will never fly through this airport again.",-1
2019-05-03,0.1,Business,2,3,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,below the class of the USA,False," I'm disgusted with what I experienced exiting the terminal on arrivals level. There was no security exiting the terminal. I was literally mobbed by men posing as Taxi and Uber drivers illegally. No police around to monitor and protect people from unauthorized solicitation. I deal with this in other countries, but never thought I would see this in the USA. This is way below the class of the USA.",-1
2019-04-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,food and trash littered all over the floors,False,"  I have never experienced an airport as bad as this one. Terminal 3 was truly disgusting with food and trash littered all over the floors and seats. We didn't want to sit in the chairs and sat on our bags instead because there was food grime everywhere. TSA pre check was closed and half of security was closed leaving us to navigate hours of waiting time. The kiosks at Jet Blue didnt work and again, over an hour wait. When we finally got through and were starving at 9:30pm because of a long day of travel, all of the restaurants were closed or closing and the only thing left was the fast food shake and burger place which was absolutely disgusting - food all over the floor of the kitchen area and trash everywhere. I could not believe I was in the United States - have travelled everywhere for years and this was truly the worst experience. Avoid this airport at all costs.",-1
2019-04-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,airport is absolutely disgusting,True,"  This airport is absolutely disgusting. I’ve flown in and out of here many times before but it’s been several years and I never remember it being this unclean. We are currently flying out of terminal 3 and the carpets are covered in food crumbs, trash, and things are just generally very dirty. It’s so filthy in here it actually stinks. Waiting for flights in airports is normally very annoying but this is so bad I’d actually rather be sitting and waiting on a plane. It’s also in need of some serious updating and tech updates. Oh, and the TSA agent was extremely rude. I got a full pat down and her hand went up my skirt which made me very uncomfortable. She also neglected to direct me to do what she needed me to do, she just stood there until asked her how she wanted me to hold my hands for whatever she needed so I could be done and move along. Will avoid flying in and out of this airport if I can.",-1

I, originally, departed from a different airport and they used testing strips to test the formula. At FLL only a machine was used, and before all of this took place my body and hands were scanned. All of this showed obvious signs that I had nothing hazardous or trafficking of any products. I have never been more insulted in my life! The airport is extremely dirty with the gate areas being covered in food particles and trash. I will never use this airport again, and I will continually warn others of the harassment that a mother can experience while traveling with her child/children.",-1

Three 6 inch cheese pizzas, almost $40.00 US! They weren’t even good pizzas! The wife picked up a panini. $10.00 US! So for about $70.00 CDN we had the privilege to eat. Thanks terminal 2 Fll. If you enjoy the airport shops, forget it, you have perhaps 2 for your shopping pleasure. Will choose MCO, MIA, or TPA in the future.",-1
2019-01-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,surely unacceptable,True," There is an extremely long wait at Immigration. We spent about 3 hours in the line. A hundred plus people waiting patiently attended by only two officers. No courtesy was shown to the elderly or infants. People were given no seating or water. People fly very long flights, myself having taken 16 hours Emirates from Mumbai. This is surely unacceptable to any international visitor to the America",-1
2019-01-20,0.9,Family Leisure,5,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,problem using FLL airport,True," I was on vacation in Florida with my husband and daughter and lost my purse which had all my identity in it. We arrived to airport early Sunday morning the 13th at 7:45am. (our flight was boarding at 10:25am). We proceeded to the line for Security since we just had carry on items and was surprised how fast the line was moving. My family went through without a problem but I was detained due to no Identity (no license). The Lead Traffic Controller was notified and arrived within a 1-2 minutes to question me. He was professional and very kind. Because I did not have any identity, He had to get an Identity questionnaire which took only another 1-2 minutes. I could tell he was extremely busy as his Communication radio was going off, but he took it in stride and actually lowered the volume so he could give me his full attention. He called Washington and after answering a few questions I was able to sign the form and go through security. He guided me through the security process, searched my bags. His biggest challenge was finding a female officer to pat me down. He had to rotate some Male officers around in order to free up the female officer. I was amazed how smooth he worked and how respectful the other officers were to him. Finally, I was cleared and was able to reunite with my family. I was most thankful to him and all the staff. They are all working so hard with minimal staff during this difficult time with the Federal Shutdown. On another note, the Airport and bathroom facilities were clean - in one bathroom there was a very attentive worker facilitating the line and keeping the room clean. I would have no problem using Fort Lauderdale Airport in the future.",1

This airport is clearly run like a ""government agency"" versus local economic engine or ""pride of our community"". Bathrooms are cleaner and fresher at a municipal sports stadium. As a professional whose job is large campus plant operations it is clear to me airport executive leadership (OPS executive) is not rounding each and every day like they are supposed to be. If they were, they'd see how much is wrong. Just today, flying out of SWA Terminal, the bathrooms adjacent to the B gates had no soap in any dispenser for 8 (yes, eight) sinks. Oh, BTW, there's was an attendant there reading his phone. Carpets are stained and rarely vacuumed. Crumbs and food spills are there trip after trip.",-1

I don’t think I have ever had one great experience with this airport. The customer service is horrible. The traffic is always busy however there is rarely ever an attendant to help move the traffic along. The baggage claim takes at least 30 minutes longer than any other airport baggage claim I’ve ever been to.,-1

I helped my mom to get her bags, it only took me 5 minutes and the transit agent gave me a $ 79 ticket just for helping my mom because they also do not show the ease of helping people. Terrible service.",-1

I will pay more money to go to other airports.",-1
2018-11-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no manners whatsoever,False,"  The TSA agents in charge of the security checks were rude, condescending, threatening people with no manners whatsoever. They treat passengers, including the very elderly in wheelchairs, with zero respect. Fort Lauderdale is perhaps the worst airport in the world solely because of them. A class in sensitivity training, or basic human decency, would go a long way. It is sad that they are getting paid to scream at, humiliate and belittle travelers.",-1

My concerns proved to be groundless though. There were no queues at Immigration and we were speedily processed through. Our bags were quickly delivered and there were no hold ups at Customs. On our return, we were pleased to discover plenty of desks open at Norwegian and check-in was quick. There were no queues at the security checks and, again, we were swiftly through. Overall, a very impressive experience.",1

When someone came up to her with a plastic water bottle and ask to throw it in the recycling, she directly the person to throw it in the trash. The person again said she wanted to throw it in the recycling and the woman directed her to throw it in the trash. She then sealed up the trash with the recycling in it and put in her cart.

Getting here is like herding cattle, you are made to wait instantly on arrival from any international flight. They made my brother wait 3 hours on the plane because there were too many people in line at immigration this airport so obviously poorly designed and mismanaged. They are definitely not capable for handeling international flights. You go from one line to the next line and each space is smaller than the next with no air conditioning or windows. Everyone goes in this never ending line no matter what status you are. Citizen or not. Baggage claim is also a mess.

2018-07-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,This was the worst airport,False,"  This was the worst airport I have ever been in. We landed in terminal 1 at gate C and realized we needed to go to gate E. We didn’t see that on any of the signs so we asked people at the help desk. They told us they had no idea what or where that was! After googling it ourselves, we realized we had to go outside to terminal 3 and leave the airport, this meant that to make our connecting flight we had to go outside and re-enter the airport and again go through security! This was for a domestic flight! I have never heard of such a thing and I have traveled in the US fairly often. This led to a huge line and we almost missed our next flight. There was also no outside bus that we saw that would take us between terminals (we waited where it said to). We had to drag and carry our luggage in the heat. Everyone we encountered seemed rude or had no idea how to answer our questions! I will never fly though here again and that is saying something because a lot of airports are busier and less convenient. Terrible!",-1
2018-06-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,not fly through FLL  again.,False,"  My husband and I have traveled all over the world and this is the first airport/entry in which all the travelers wait at the same line, regardless of the passport your holding and if you have a visa or not. All other countries have a line for local citizens. Where is the loyalty? First, we had to wait to be deplaned because the customs area was full. We then had to wait after passing the jet-way on the hallway. We were then allowed to go downstairs where the ""fun"" began. Have you visited Walt Disney World? Well the lines were just like that. One ""maze"" to get to the automated machines. Then another ""maze"" that eventually will take you behind the machines, around the room and surprised, another room full of mazes. TWO HOURS later we were able to get our luggage. The whole process shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, but like most government jobs, nobody seemed to care. I really feel sorry for the folks that will be traveling during the holidays. I will not fly through FLL ever again.",-1
2018-06-19,0.1,Business,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,airport is extremely disappointing,False,"  This airport is extremely disappointing. For an airport serving such often visited cities and known for hospitality and services, this airport is extremely disappointing in terms of ambience, facilities and services. It needs upgrading and perhaps even overhauling. I travel through frequently and frankly I dread having to use this airport. I do not believe that the authorities are taking feedback seriously. I am a priority club holder, sometimes with long wait time and there is no lounge in terminal 3 where many flights originate and arrive. What kind of airport is this? Please open a hospitality lounge in Terminal three. It is badly, sorely needed.",-1
2018-05-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,terrible experience,False," Terrible experience. TSA had to tell people if they were precheck or not (even though most competent people should know). Then the TSA agent proceeded to open a new line for precheck where the back of the line got moved to the front. The guard who was looking at my ticket needed to make sure I stayed behind the line even though I was with the man in front of me. The Cucina & Co hostess was very rude. When I asked for a cup of coffee she made me get up and walk down to the register to pay, cream, sugar, etc instead of providing customer service by bringing those to me. Will avoid this airpo at all costs.",-1

The employees are so rude. Yesterday I was supposed to fly out and my mobile ticket wasn't scanning. The employee had me behind the desk using the other scanner by myself. I don't know how to use it and she just kept screaming at me to leave the long security line I just waited in to go stand in an even longer line to get a printed ticket. She never once even tried to help me to make sure I was doing it right. Needless to say I missed my birthday trip to see my family. I was so upset and after talking to several people outside this airport has an awful reputation. I will pay the extra money to fly out of West Palm. The people at FLL do not care about your experience. Everyone I tried to talk to (and I was being very polite) either ignored me or told me ""I don't know"".",-1

This is the worst airport I have ever been through! I have travelled in many developing countries and been to over 30 countries. This is by far the worst airport experience I have had. It took 3 hours to get through arrivals, the staff were pretty unfriendly and they stressed a lot of people out, especially people that had transits. If you have any other option I would arrive at a different airport. Departure was fine but lack of food after 9.00pm is pretty unusual for an airport in a developed country. As a side note this is the first negative review I have ever left for an airport.",-1
2018-04-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,never use this airport again,False," I flew on a Thursday, believing it would be easier than dealing with the airport on a weekend. I'm sure it was but that didn't mean this was a pleasant experience. It just meant there were less employees on duty. Getting off the plane, we were led to believe we were going to baggage, then customs. Surprise! We had to wait behind 150 or so people to use the kiosks, devices created by Satan himself. Why kiosks? We already filled this information out on our customs papers and our photos are on our passports! The woman in charge sent me to the wrong kiosk where I was asked where I came from. Was she kidding? No. That only took 30 minutes. No big whoop. Next: customs and another huge line. Only 2 counters were open! The customs guy was having a great time chatting it up with passengers and taking his time. Good for him, bad for someone who is about to miss a flight. Next was baggage, where I waited about 10 minutes before being told our carousel had been changed. I waited another 10 minutes when, a staff member finally told me another employee across the way had my bag. Why? I don't know. At the airline counter the representative wanted to know how I was doing. I'm surprised she isn't afraid to ask that question. Then it was on to the TSA. Again, employees asking how you are. Please. The food selections are pitiful. One floor had a Starbucks, a pretzel store and a giant bar. It my be an alcoholic's dream but, no good for anyone looking for something resembling a meal. I will never use this airport again. If it's the only choice, I will go to another island instead.",-1

2018-04-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,worst airport we have ever used,True,"  This is the worst airport we have ever used. After a nine hour flight we were told that there were no buses available. We were left in the aircraft for thirty five minutes. When eventually we were bused to the terminal we saw at least four buses parked up at the perimeter. On entering the building we queued for twenty five minutes for the automatic passport readers, we then walked a distance and had to queue again for a further fifty minutes to go through immigration again this time a manned one. There are numerous desks here but sadly only four were operational, this is shameful to treat people this way. There was a female member of staff walking up and down acting as though she was some sort of principal teacher smirking at the line of passengers and then having a conversation with the immigration people from time to time. She seemed to find the whole thing humorous. I doubt very much that any American citizens would stand for this kind of treatment arriving in a British airport - appalling! Having now spent one hour fifty minutes we arrived at baggage reclaim to find that our luggage hadn't been offloaded! We then waited as per the instruction board for an hour at carousel Number three. Finally our luggage was found going around on carousel number two!, To summarise this airport this airport is not fit for purpose. It is totally degrading to treat fare paying passengers in this manner. Management and staff would do well to remember who keeps them employed!",-1
2018-04-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,2,,1.0,,,,1.0,shameful way to treat passengers,False,"  The very worst experience in terms of queuing for both accepting passengers into terminal (we had to stay in the airplane for more than half hour), but even worse for passport/security check, which took more than 90 minutes standing in long lines. After traveling from 10 hours standing up for the long security wait felt like a real health hazard. I think it is a shameful way to treat passengers.",-1
2018-04-05,0.6,Couple Leisure,3,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,better than led to believe,True," Reviews of Fort Lauderdale Airport have been none too complementary, particularly in relation to getting between terminals and the arrival experience. The airport is undergoing extensive refurbishment to bring it into the 21st century and more humanely manage the 32 million passengers that passed through its gates in 2017. As of March 2018, there's still some way to go. Arrival from LGW on a BA flight started off badly as we were kept waiting 30 minutes until we could disembark. This is commonplace, apparently. A touch of amusement was added to the frustration when some new glass doors just inside the terminal refused to accept a key code. Eventually, they did open and one had a chance to see what the new airport is going to look light: light and spacious, but with the usual long walkways to get to customs and baggage collection. Like other US airports, FLL has Automated Passport Control (APC) which gives passengers the good feeling that getting through customs will be much quicker, but which turns out to be just another level of bureacracy and adding yet more mug shots and fingerprints to the database that the US must have on every entrant. The overall process of getting through customs and baggage collection, plus someone to check that the APC had a stamp on it and another to relieve each passenger, added up to just over an hour. That's not that bad, as many reviews report waits of several hours. Once out of terminal 4, it's then a matter of waiting for the complementary shuttle to take one to terminal one where the car rental is also based. In the end, we gave up with the wait and paid $20 each to a man with a minibus who took us there a lot quicker. For the return trip, we used the complementary shuttle and were impressed by the helpfulness of the driver, who actually got out of his seat to help people on and off with their luggage. Check-in for BA Club World was absolutely fine, but the security check process was made over-complicated by staff putting everyone through the 3D body scanner and insisting that everything (tissues and gum included) were removed from pockets - and giving passengers plenty of attitude if those requirements weren't adhered to. Surprisingly, there's no business class lounge in the international terminal, which seems a huge oversight if FLL wishes to attract premium customers. That said, there was a spacious area prior to the gates with plenty of seats (including rocking chairs) overlooking the runway and a number of food and drink concessions. And there was free WiFi. Unfortunately, some of the staff possessed the same attitudinal problem as that encountered going through security. Overall, FLL was better than we'd been led to believe and we'd use it again in preference to Miami.",1

2018-02-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,transfers within the airport are pretty dire,False,"  Fort Lauderdale Airport. I know this isn't in Orlando, but some might be lured by the lower prices to use this airport instead of flying direct to Orlando. We have just used it, and saved £1600 for a party of six, including two children, into the bargain. But was it worth it? Well yes, I suppose it was, but the transfers within the airport itself is pretty dire. There are four terminals, BA arrive in Terminal 4, the hire cars are in Terminal 1, which involves a bus ride and no means of transferring luggage other than to carry it. Luckily we were only doing it one way, on the way back, as our BA flight to FLL was cancelled and we flew direct to Orlando on the 4th February instead of the 3rd to FLL. Bear in mind we are four adults, two children aged 5 and 2, five cases, sundry handbaggage and two car seats and you can see the problem. Ten dollars for two trolleys from the car hire drop-off, up one floor, and outside to the bus. A bit of a scrum, everybody is carrying large amounts of luggage trying to get on. The bus driver did his best, no doubt illegal with the amount of cases stacked on the floors because the racks were full. So round to terminal 4, another ten dollars to get two trollies to wheel into the dparture area, a total of about one hundred yards. You can walk it apparently, but it would take about twenty minutes. Hot, dirty, tired, andand extremely annoyed, the name neither has the glitz of Hollywood and certainly none of the slickness of an International Airport. Once inside things improve a bit. Didn't use the catering so can't comment. Seemed to be staffed by agency staff who's command of English was pretty low in some cases, and the use of some screeching announcer who not only talked too fast but the pitch of her voice made her unintelligible.",-1

First, I get to FLL airport which is one of the worst airports I have ever traveled out of, no airline lounges, hardly no shops or restaurants pre-check in. I had flown in to MIA and took a commuter train to FLL, I had 6 hours to spare in FLL, which I thought I would spend in a nice restaurant or lounge, that did not happen.

You expect long immigration in the USA but 2 hours is very tedious. On the way out no lounge, no seating, queues for toilets, dining, coffee and pretty well everything in a hot uncomfortable environment. Avoid. I presume the Americans don’t really want tourists.",-1
2018-02-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,the worst airport in the USA,False,  By far the worst airport in the USA I have been to. 4 hours from landing to clearing baggage claim. Horrendous lines at immigration very slow moving with no air conditioning and no water to drink. On departure long lines for shuttle buses to transfer from car rental to terminal and at gate it was chaos with crowds of people standing waiting as not enough seats while people trying to get off planes had to fight their way through the crowds and you couldn't hear any of the announcements as the PA system was too quiet. Very limited food and drink facilities.It seems like they have expanded too quickly and can't cope with the volume of passengers now using this airport.,-1

Departure from a small wing of the terminal which was rammed, one place to eat and drink absolutely packed, overpriced and staff openly complaining and arguing with customers.

Arrival was fairly smooth, and our luggage was at the carousel shortly after landing. On our departure date we had a four hour wait because we had to leave the ship in the morning, while our flight did not leave until mid-afternoon. Although very busy, I considered it fairly easy to get through security and to our departure gate. Our section of the terminal had a couple of fast food outlets/coffee shops, and one sit down restaurant named ""Jack Nicklaus"" where we ate lunch. Much to my surprise, our meal was quite good, and, (for an airport), reasonably priced. The one recommendation I would make to airport management is to provide some seating at the hotel shuttle pick-up point located between Terminals 3 and 4.",1
2017-10-15,0.7,Couple Leisure,3,4,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,"I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA""
",False,"  I prefer to use Fort Lauderdale international for my trips over Miami International for a number of reasons, but primarily parking and getting in/out of the airport. I generally do not fly in/out of this airport on international trips as I'll go with an airline that has connections in one of their hubs: typically Atlanta or New York. So I cannot comment on the experience coming through customs at the international terminal. I live in South Florida and they are building a new international terminal, so perhaps the experiences will be improved after that. At peak times it can get very congested and if you're picking up a UBER ride (which has become more popular), the space allotted for them is not large, so that can be a hassle identifying your ride. Communication between you and the driver is key. The terminals I fly through are quite clean (terminals 1 and 2 primarily, and occasionally 30), the security lines can be slow at times, so I always get to the airport 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of my flight. Food selection is OK, and if you're leaving on a late flight, your options may be limited. Parking is pretty good as they have some large parking garages, but if you're parking when it's a holiday or peak travel days, you may be forced to park in one of the remote lots, that's a real hassle. Plan ahead and get there even earlier if that's the case. As for friendliness of staff at the airport, that's pretty much a premium. But despite all of this, I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA.",1
2017-08-19,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,not a family friendly airport,False, It is hotter inside Fort Lauderdale airport than outside. There is only 2 places to get food for you family. This is not and I repeat not a family friendly airport. When you get to the gates the areas are extremely crowded and limited amount of seats. They should be paying us to fly in and out of this airport.,-1
2017-07-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,3,3,,3.0,0.0,,,,no bathroom facilities for 4 legged friends,False," I was a passenger on a Jetblue flight to Boston. The flight was originally scheduled to leave FLL at 4:06 p. m., arriving at Boston Logan shortly after 7:00 p.m. However, inclement weather in the NY/NJ area caused what turned out to be a four hour + delay. Although an inconvenience, I understand that these things happen. Traveling with me was my eight pound Yorkshire Terrier. She travels in a Jetblue crate, and sits under the seat in front of me. She is considered one of my carry ons, and the charge for her is $100.00 each way. What I do not understand, however, is why there is nowhere within the terminal for dogs to relieve themselves? During my delay, I was forced to take my dog outside a total of three times, and go through security a total of three times! I feel this is unacceptable, and, with more and more people flying with dogs/cats, cannot fathom why there is no bathroom facilities provided for our four legged friends. Believe that a ""hydrant"" area has recently opened in terminal one, and feel the same facilities should be provided in each of the FLL terminals.",-1

There were about 500 people in a cramped area with 2 area to get your luggage. Asking for assistance by their employees was a joke. They were extremely rude and discourteous. 2 hours to get through customs. Customs agents were rude. Everyone seems unhappy to work there. We arrived 20 mins early at 4:20 and was not finished through customs until a little after 6pm and our next flight begins boarding at 6:30.

Then we passed though to collect our luggage. Absolute chaos. I waited with our hand luggage while my husband went to retrieve our hold luggage from the carousel. One hour passed, another hour passed and by this time more planes had arrived with passengers crowding in for their luggage. The luggage hall was blocked solid and I found out later the carousel had broken down. The staff varied from very courteous and helpful to downright rude. To treat visitors to USA the way one of the male assistance did was nothing short of abusive. There were many elderly passengers due to join a cruise and many were struggling. Four hours after flights arrived we exited the terminal, completely stressed through not being able to join up with our travelling companions. Then outside to get our shuttle was equally chaotic. Not a pleasant experience and would completely put us off using this airport again.. Note this was nothing to do with immigration system as that went well, the failure was luggage collection. Bad experience altogether.",-1

My experience echoes others' in dreadfulness but for different reasons. First, at curbside, there were no Smarte Cartes - we had to drive to the next terminal where there were still none although a sheriff's deputy went in the terminal and located an abandoned one. So then I got to push it fully loaded back up the hill outside in the heat to my original terminal. And at the departure lounges, there are 4 outlets apiece on the concrete pillars - 11 outlets for 3 departure lounges.
