2024-07-23,0.5,Family Leisure,2,5,5.0,5,5,3.0,5.0,1.0,host was very evasive,True," We were told to go through security downstairs at MacNamara. We had a Delta flight. The security ""host"" said the lines were shorter there. I tried to talk with the ""host"" but he was very evasive and brushed me off. When we got there we were forced to go back upstairs. Everything else was fine.",1
2024-06-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,“no signage”,True," There is no signage to tell someone who has never been here before where ""rideshare"" is. We did not see a sign for rideshare in the whole place until 3 different people had to tell us how to get across the street. Not even the Uber driver thought to say anything about where we were or why he couldnt find us... while we watched people being picked up for 40 minutes.",-1
2024-01-15,0.2,Solo Leisure,2,4,4.0,3,0,,,1.0,“left us there with no explanation”,True," Myself and 3 other passengers were traveling together and we all needed wheelchairs. Well they put us in the wheelchairs when we arrived in Detroit at gate A63, but they left us there with no explanation! The two young men that were there said nothing and they left us! Well 2 of the seniors are blind! We asked several staff members, including a ticket agent across from gate A63 to call someone, she just quickly said they will be back and went back to her gate! Well she didn't call. I stopped a maintenance staff person, he took the time to call someone. Then a young man we saw working with wheelchair staff for help and he informed us he knew about the situation and knew the person who left us! He was a supervisor, but he could not push one of us to baggage claim! Well we sat there until 4:30pm until we got help! A few choice words were passed by one of the seniors! We got to baggage claim but this should not have happened at all! Detroit Metro staff dropped the ball on this one! You do not leave 4 seniors waiting in wheelchairs without help! 2 blind and 2 over 70 that can't walk thru the airport!",1
2023-07-14,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,"always clean, convenient",False," Detroit Metro is always clean, convenient and well maintained. Staff is usually pleasant and helpful. We travel through DTW about 3-4 times per year and we have always had a positive experience.",1
2023-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,,1,0,,,,This airport is horrible,False,"  After arrival the departure roads were completely backed up, so no shuttles could get in. Didn’t matter because my family has been waiting over 2 hours for our baggage. Still waiting. This airport is horrible.",-1
2022-11-18,0.2,Business,1,2,,1,0,,1.0,,stuck for an hour trying to pick someone up,False," When it comes to arrivals, no airport, does it worse. It is a parking lot. There is no security moving traffic along or making people go and you get stuck for almost an hour just trying to pick someone up. Every other airport I’ve ever been to has security that makes cars continue to move and not just park. It’s like this literally every time which is why I’m starting to pick up arrivals at departures.",-1
2021-11-08,0.3,Couple Leisure,4,4,4.0,2,1,1.0,5.0,4.0,the proper social distancing is not happening,False,  The problem here is that there are several people who are not wearing masks. There is no security at the 'check in' level and the proper social distancing is not happening either. This is a setup for an outbreak to happen anytime. Its like people don't even believe there is a pandemic going on. What do they believe is happening I wonder and why isn't there someone to enforce the mask rule. My wife is in the 'vulnerable group'as she has just gone through Cancer treatments recently and there is nothing we can do about this.,-1
2021-07-24,0.1,Business,1,4,5.0,1,1,3.0,4.0,4.0,Idiotic food and beverage staffing management,False,"  Idiotic food and beverage staffing management. Covid excuses: One poor overworked worker responsible for managing a full bar plus long line of customers for Grobbel's sandwiches. Poor woman at Grobbel's isn’t allowed to take orders so has to wait for the overworked one to get to her customers before she makes their sandwiches. Separately, the Starbucks in Terminal B has a rude closed sign with no info on alternatives. Probably 400 customers a day are confused and misdirected, and their irritation is invisible to you. Clean it up.",-1
2021-06-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,1,1,3.0,3,1,1.0,3.0,1.0,This airport was extremely disappointing,False,"  We had a four hour layover here (added by the airline after reservations were made). This airport was extremely disappointing. Very few places open. In the 5-6 hours we spent here (delays!), I never went in a clean bathroom, never saw anybody cleaning anything. I tried to use some hand sanitizer. It was empty! Our gate was changed several times. Nobody told us anything to keep us apprised. They just sent us a text. If your phone was still in airplane mode, that would do no good. Right now, we are still waiting to board. Nobody is even at the counter and we are supposed to depart in 13 minutes. We've already been delayed 5 times.",-1
2020-06-10,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,5,,3.0,5.0,"it is seamless, clean, and very efficient",False,"  This airport is amazing. I was connecting from a very small airport from a regional flight. I step off the plane in concourse b. I then go through the underground tunnel to connect to Paris CDG. I take the tram and stop at chick-fil-a. The tram is very nice and quiet with lots of room. I stop at the skyclub and it is one of the best I've ever seen. You can walk, take moving walkways, or the tram. The airport is very efficient from connections with seats for everyone. If you want to shop there are stores there too. The McNamara is the only terminal I've been in and that will be the only terminal I will use. If I have the option to connect through here, then I will go for it, because it is seamless, clean, and very efficient.",1
2019-12-11,0.1,Business,4,3,3.0,4,1,1.0,4.0,2.0,"no apology, no comment, no eye contact",True," Purchased 2 products from The Wall Street Journal across from A19, one expired. Took it back to bring it to their attention. However the clerk merely threw away the expired one and found one on the rack not expired and left the remaining expired products to be sold. I asked if he was going to pull expired products, however I received no apology, no comment, no eye contact. As to how expensive products are (Price gouging) for us that travel routinely this is despicable behavior. I will be contacting the FTA to start the investigation process.",-1
2019-10-12,1.0,Family Leisure,4,5,5.0,4,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,a very nice airport,False,"  This is a very nice airport. It is clean, modern and there are of plenty of places to eat and shop. If you are lucky you might see the famous water fountain. Even the seats in the gates are comfortable, a rarity for an airport. I will be happy to fly there again, even if for a layover.",1
2019-10-02,0.4,Business,2,5,3.0,4,1,5.0,3.0,1.0,a middling airport,True," Detroit is a marginal airport with oddly assorted amenities. Shopping and dining opportunities abound, but travelers aren't typically there for the high-end options. Airports exist to connect travelers to their flights, with an offering of convenient quick-stop amenities for a bite to eat and a beverage of your choice. DTW appears to have been laid out with good intentions, with features like the quick elevated tram and plentiful people movers. Nonetheless, the airport lacks adequate quick-stop amenities that the hurried traveler depends upon. Furthermore, those amenities shut their doors/kiosks well before the final flights have delivered the last weary travelers, leaving them with no option for a snack or drink (other than vending machine). The hiring practices at the airport, particularly the TSA agents and ticket counter personnel, are also marginal. These folks seem to think that being surly is part of their job description. There are exceptions to this blanket statement, of course, and those gems are truly valued. Also, the curbside baggage handlers and Skycaps are typically quite friendly and courteous. (Of course, those gentlemen are often tipped for handling bags.) The security lines are often long, but the floors and facility itself are clean. It looks good. Once through security, it is easy to get to your terminal. Overall, a middling airport.",1
2019-09-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,,3,0,,,1.0,shortage of wheelchair assistants,False,"  I was flying to Amsterdam and I requested wheelchair assistance. I was told to sit close to the check-in counter and they will come. I waited for half an hour and decided to slowly and with difficulty walk towards the wheelchair assistance counter. When I got there with my daughter, we saw several customers screaming at the lady at the counter. They have been waiting for so long and nobody came to push them. Many were frustrated. Some decided to limp the whole way to the gate as they did not want to miss their flights. When I got to the counter the lady at the counter had my name already and there were so many passengers ahead of me, all waiting in frustration and anxiety. My flight was 6.15 pm and by the time we got a person to push me through, it was 5.30 pm. I barely made it to the plane after the security check. With this delay, I did not have time to stop for restroom or buy some food before the flight. I would say collectively in 2 locations my wait time was 1 hour just for the wheelchair service. And it was 1 hour only because 3 passengers ahead of me decided to limp to their gates and remembering my trip to Texas in July it was the same problem. There was not enough wheelchair assistance to push people who have difficulty walking or unable to walk. Worried that I may miss my flight with my daughter who was flying with me to Texas in July, pushed me as we had our own wheelchair. But this trip, I am on my own and I am depended on assistance. Why is there an acute shortage of wheelchair assistants? Looks like it was not an issue yesterday only. The anxiety caused to these people who are helpless and also I wonder how many people missed their flights and how many planes waited longer than they should for them.",-1
2019-04-12,1.0,Business,5,5,5.0,5,5,3.0,,5.0,a very pleasant experience,True,"  Very friendly employees. Arriving with a rental car and a quick bus transfer at the terminal, terminal very clean with clear and easy signage, security check took a few minutes with very friendly employees - they have the time to chat with the travellers a few sentences, after security check there are some fast food restaurants and enough seats to take a rest, a very pleasant experience",1
2019-04-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,2,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,a big thumbs-down,True,"  Hey DTW, I know it's hard to believe, but there are airplane flights that take place after 9PM. So arriving at the North Terminal as flights are delayed until 11PM, yet every single restaurant and bar in the North Terminal closes at 9 does not make for happy travelers. That plus the lack of places to charge one's phone equals a big thumbs-down.",-1
2018-12-27,0.8,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,0,,,3.0,not hard to be parent/child friendly,False,"  My 2.5 year old son and I flew from Detroit to Greenville 12/25/2018 with Delta airline. I knew going in that DTW would be even busier with it being Christmas. When I got inside, the check-in kiosk for Delta did not recognize any of my information. This occurred in Greenville when I flew to Detroit on 12/21/18. I stood in a very long line for 30 minutes before reaching the check-in agent. The check-in agent could not help me at all and said I needed to go stand in ""a special line."" So, I go and I stand in another line, this time for maybe 15 minutes. Remember, I have a toddler, a car seat, and a carry on bag I am trying to handle by myself. This special check-in employee was able to check me in. Apparently because I had a minor flying with me, that is why the kiosk would not allow me to check-in. Then I was told that while they could check the car seat for free under Delta policy, I would need to walk to the other side of the Delta check-in terminal and place it with the oversized luggage. Now I had to walk across the terminal to drop the car seat off and then walk all the way back to the other side I started at in order to go through security. Again, remember that I am one adult trying to manage a car seat, a toddler, and a carry-on bag. I finally get back to the other side of the check-in terminal and to domestic security check. Thankfully we were able to get through security rather quickly. Then you have one TSA agent who was literally having almost every bag in his line be checked. I had a back pack and a carry-on that needed to be checked, which means additional wait time because only one person was there going through items. I know TSA has to do their jobs, but this agent was flagging almost every bag going through (I watched him with the bags before and after ours). Yes, I had toys from Christmas morning we were trying to get home to SC. I have flown in and out of Detroit numerous times to visit my family in MI. I have never experienced such frustration and utter anger with Detroit as I did yesterday. Dtw is not made for parents who are flying solo with a child, plain and simple. There are no courtesy strollers or luggage carriers with a child seat attached. When I expressed my frustration to a Delta agent about being a solo parent trying to fly with a minor and being told to wait and then walk all over the airport, all I got was backlash about how everyone has to do it. It is not hard to be parent/child friendly.",-1
2018-11-24,0.4,Family Leisure,5,5,3.0,5,3,,5.0,1.0,I really like this airport.,True,"  Overall I really like this airport. Easy to get to and easy to navigate. However, I am traveling today and at the security checkpoint I encountered two especially nasty workers. One woman was taking the boarding passes and DL’s. She mumbled something and I was next in line. So I asked if I should come to her. She rolled her eyes and repeated “next in line” with a sarcastic tone. Why so nasty? I did nothing offense. The next worker was another woman telling people to take shoes off and stay with your belongings until they go on the conveyor to be x-rayed. She apparently was tired of saying take your shoes off, so she mumbled (loud enough for everyone to hear) “I am apparently just talking to myself”. While these incidents may not seem like a big deal, they do reflect on the airport and set the tone for people’s trips. If you don’t like your job find another.",1
2018-08-21,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,plenty of restaurants,True," It's a very modern airport that is ready for possible extensions. The tram in the McNamara terminal makes it very easy to move in the terminal. The airport is very spacious, enough seating and plenty of restaurants and shops. There is also free WiFi that works well.",1
2018-06-24,0.1,Business,1,4,4.0,1,1,1.0,3.0,3.0,overpriced shopping mall,False," Airport or overpriced shopping mall? I travel quite frequently for work and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of the most ridiculous places I transit. This airport seems to consider itself some sort of luxury shopping experience instead of a place to board or change airplanes. Walking through the airport you will notice large selection of expensive name brand stores and high priced restaurants. You will also notice a sever lack of quick and useful concessions. I can't speak for all travelers, but I myself rarely have time during my 1 hour connection time to have a nice sit down dinner at PF Changs and then do some browsing at Swarovski Crystal. What I do have time for is to stop at a food concession that will have my order ready in a reasonable amount of time and maybe for a nice cup of coffee. Neither of these is a possibility at DTW. The severe lack of of basic food/beverage concessions is appalling. Any concession that would be considered ""quick"" is never quick in DTW. The biggest reason is because of the lack of options the lines at the ""quick"" places is often out the door and these places are generally understaffed. On example is the Starbucks located in the A terminal. There are 2 Starbucks for 76 gates, each staffed with 2 under motivated individuals. I have seen lines with over 20 people in them while not surprisingly the Hugo Boss store next door is completely empty. Detroit Airport needs to figure out its true purpose. The purpose of an airport is to provide paying passengers the opportunity to get a bite to eat and a coffee while attempting to make a connection that has most likely been reduced because of weather or some other reason. It is not to sell MAC cosmetics and running gear.",-1
2018-05-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,3,2.0,1,2,2.0,1.0,1.0,No help for the handicapped,False,"  No help for the handicapped at this airport. The disaster started with a 40 minute wait for my arriving plane to get a gate for us to debark. In 60 years of flying, in airports all over the country, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my plane to get a gate. Then finding that my connecting flight was in another building and I would ""just have to go downstairs, through the tunnel and upstairs to the other gates,"" the gate clerk scoffed at me when I said that would take 40 minutes with my arthritic knees. He didn't offer transportation, I had to ask for it. Apparently there are no golf carts or trolleys for the mobility disabled at the airport, as there are in every other airport I've visited. He ordered a wheelchair, which took 20 minutes to arrive. In spite of everyone's assurances that I would make it, the plane left without me when I was only a gate and a half away. No one ever attempted to contact the departing gate to let them know that a crippled passenger was trying desperately to get there on time. Other than the wheelchairs, which are slow and take an inexcusable amount of time to arrive, this airport makes no attempt to accommodate mobility handicapped persons. There were no electric carts traveling the length of the interminably long tunnel between C and A terminals, and none that I could see at gate level either. Again, something I've seen in all but the smallest airports. This is not a place a mobility disabled person would want to travel through.",-1
2018-04-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,,1,0,,,3.0,most dysfunctional airport,True,"  This is the most dysfunctional airport I have ever seen. I was just there to change planes. It is extremely time-consuming and difficult to navigate the 3 huge far-flung terminals with poor signage and no explanation of how to get from one to the other. I had to ask staff along the way or I would have wandered endlessly. I actually had to go through security a 2nd time that was located *inside a hotel* at the airport because the regular security was not operating. They also seem to have a rule against scanning luggage. My suitcase was *lost for 5 days* with no record of it ever being scanned by either airline I flew, so I thought it was lost at the point of origin. It was finally located at the *wrong airline* in Detroit (why they sat on it for 5 days, I'll never understand). It took a dozen phone calls and literally hours on hold to get the bag located and sent to a 4th airport (because I was no longer in the city where it was supposed to go.) There was one helpful woman at Detroit who tried and did help me, finally. If it weren't for her my bag would still be a mystery. Delta denied all responsibility but was required to reimburse my out-of-pocket expenses (my daughters having to buy changes of clothing.)",-1
2018-03-10,0.2,Business,1,3,,3,0,,,,Avoid this airport at all costs,False,"  
Detroit airport is by far the worst airport I have ever been to. Not only are none of the flights on time but the gate for your flight will change at least once and flights are delayed by 1 or 2 hours. Avoid this airport at all costs. This is not an airport you want to experience.",-1
2018-02-23,0.9,Family Leisure,5,5,4.0,5,4,3.0,,4.0,DTW is a grand airport,True," DTW is the unparalleled airport success of the Midwest. The McNamara Terminal is beautiful and architecturally stunning and always clean. There are multiple TSA queues, allowing for quick terminal access, even on international departures. Food options are really strong here (any airport with a Chick-Fil-A is worthy of an award), and as far as I could tell, the shopping options were solid. Gate seating is plentiful, and DTW is a grand airport.",1

2017-05-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,3,3,3.0,4,4,4.0,3.0,2.0,baggage claim is horrible,False, I fly 2-3 times a year and every time I come into Detroit airport their baggage claim is horrible. It's the longest wait I have ever waited for baggage. Usually 35-45 min at least before the belt even starts moving. Just completely terrible. It's like they have only one person is working to unload luggage. The airport itself is fine but retrieving luggage is a 0 out of 10,1
