2022-12-15,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Incompetent and typical for California,False, It's inconceivable that ONT International airport has to delay flight until the sun melts the ice off wings of planes. Frontier Airlines should have left at 5.45 a.m. and they could not de ice their plane ruining everyone's connections. Still sitting waiting for the sun to rise and maybe melt ice despite temperature will be the same at 7.32 a.m. Incompetent and typical for California,-1
2021-07-12,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Ontario Airport customer review,False,"  I love flying Ontario Airport. It’s convenient, never busy like the LAX nightmare. It’s small fast and convenient. They have China Airlines flights but not many International flights. Popular flights to Las Vegas Hawaii and Seattle. Nice and clean.",1
2021-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Nothing but issues,False,  This is the rudest airport I have ever been to. Nothing but issues. Issues with going through security with a 1 yr old and all they did was yell and did not seem to understand or even help. I will never fly to or from this airport again and I will be letting family and friends know how the experience was. Also the place is very dirty and disgusting.,-1
2021-03-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,someone does need to care,False,"  Well, obviously no one reads this or even cares about it as nothing happens and my issues are similar to the ones everyone else is having. Staff are extremely uncooperative and using language that is not understandable. A person just said, “You alarmed” as if we were supposed to know what that means. Next thing we know is that they need to check our hands because we could be hiding something on our hands. Next thing they say it’s just lotion or something. Does the advanced technology that we use not tell the difference between harmful substance and lotion? I know nothing will happen from this as no one even cares, especially those from the airport, but someone does need to care.",-1
2020-12-01,0.3,Business,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,have consistently experienced long waits,False,  I have flown into this airport several times and have consistently experienced long waits for rental car shuttle buses. The buses are sometimes too small to handle the waiting crowd and are never timely. The airport apparently doesn’t know how to update what baggage claim bags arrive into also.,-1
2019-10-29,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,,this one was the worst experience,False,"  
They are restricting Uber/Lyft but there should be a Cab at Airport. We have to call a cab to go to the Airport which is ok but when we arrived there was no cab. We tried to call several cab companies but they would not come to the Airport. There should be phone numbers listed so it would be easy for Arriving passengers. When we got a cab the driver told us that due to some reasons no one wants to come to the Airport so there are very little cabs available. We travel lots so used John Wayne, LAX, San Diego Airport but this one was the worst experience on getting transportation. How you can develop airport without proper transportation?",-1
2017-09-19,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,understaffed and unprepared,False,  At 6am on a Monday morning there were literally hundreds of people waiting to go through security. Clearly everyone is frustrated with this idiocy. I travel for a living and I can tell you this is unacceptable and incredibly incompetent to be so understaffed and unprepared. Foolishness.,-1
