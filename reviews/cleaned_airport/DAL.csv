2024-08-31,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,handled the situation with excellence,False,"  I believe myself to be semi-well traveled and have experienced many airport scenarios in my lifetime (middle aged) and will have to give kudos to Dallas Love Field TSA agents for their remarkable work getting me from the baggage claim area for general boarding all the way to my gate “with time to spare” in as little time as I can possibly fathom. I actually witnessed a family who did not make their flight (one prior to mine but same gate) and persisted by raising their voices that the gate agent should have known they were there but because TSA took so much time, they were late. The truth later came out that they were ONLY in line for one hour, on a holiday weekend. That is exceptional but poor timing on their part. Everyone in the aviation world knows that on a holiday weekend, there is a 2.5-3 hour minimum time preparation period to make your flight. So a free plug for DLF, consider this!! Saying all of this, not only was TSA awesome in their timeliness, but the gate agents kept their cool and handled the situation with excellence.",1
2024-07-20,0.2,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,This airport is horrible,False,"   This airport is horrible. Upon checking in, the tsa people in the front were extremely rude and talked to me like I knew how their machines work because apparently I was standing in the wrong area. They told me to go to counter 5 and the lady at counter 3 yelled at me for not being in her line. They walked around yelling at people standing in line directing them elsewhere even though they told us to stand where we were. There were limited seating once you got in through the screening. The center of the airport was packed and there was no seating when i got lunch. Some of the outlets had no power so you could not charge devices. My flight was delayed due to the tech outage and the lady at the counter was extremely rude if you had asked her any questions. I understand that they can have a bad day but every employee I interacted with either seemed like they did not want to answer my question or just looked like they did not want to he here. I hooked another flight out of here again for my next trip, but I regret it. Don't fly out of this location!",-1
2024-06-15,0.7,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,,"The terminal is bright, spacious",True,"  The airport was very crowded for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend. Nonetheless, there was plenty of seating at the gates and dining options ranging from sit down restaurants to fast food. The terminal is bright, spacious and with plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Going through security was a breeze with TSA-Pre. The Airport WIFI is easy to connect too and fast. The major drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms. On a busy travel holiday, this meant waiting times of about 10 minutes. Given the number of passengers that fly through the airport daily, renovating and/or expanding bathrooms should be considered.",1
2024-04-18,0.1,Business,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,TSA and Clear staff are deplorable,True,"  TSA and Clear staff are deplorable at this airport! They are incompetent and entitled. I clearly understand how to respectfully express frustration. When faced with incompetence and ignorance. These organizations staff seem to think they are perfect and cannot accept respectfully communicating frustration with their failures / inconsistencies. TSA and Clear fail to train their staff. However, their staff is proficient at being rude, incompetent, and intolerant of being respectfully confronted regarding their rudeness and incompetence!",-1
2024-04-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,,"used to love this airport"" ",False,"   If you are using Uber or Lyft do not use this airport. If you have a disability or are elderly it is extremely difficult to get to the area for pick up and there is a lack of signage and a lack of personnel for assistance. Use DFW. I used to love this airport but not anymore. Whomever made this decision did not take into consideration, people with disabilities or the elderly.",-1
2024-01-19,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,"security was a breeze"" ",True,"  Flew to FLL 5 days before Christmas. The roadway into the airport and the terminal were beautifully decorated for the season. For pre-holiday travel, the terminal was busy but not at all crowded. There was plenty as seating available as well as plentiful dining options from sit down restaurants to fast food to choose from. The terminal is bright and very spacious with plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Even though it was night time, one could look out across the well lit airfield and see planes taxing and taking off. Going through security was a breeze with TSA Pre clearance.",1
2023-12-29,0.2,Business,2.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,“you keep walking and walking and walking”,True,"  The ways they are now making people hike from baggage claim to a garage 15 minutes away is obscene. Especially if you are a business woman wearing heals and toting luggage. What rocket scientist thought having the baggage claim so far away from taxi's etc,? It's the most ineffective, frustrating and idiotic change I have ever witnessed in any airport I've traveled through. Some genius needs to move the options back to the entrance of the baggage claim, duh. I really cannot believe they spent the dollars moving this so far away from the baggage pick up. It's twilight zone stuff...you keep walking and walking and walking.",-1
2023-12-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,location of ride share is terrible,False,  The location of ride share is terrible. The distance and directions are both very bad. With everyone using ride share today the airport should encourage its use and make it convenient. Love appears to make it as far and complicated as possible.,-1
2023-12-02,0.7,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,,the lack of bathrooms,True,"  The terminal is bright, spacious and with plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Surprisingly, the airport was not very crowded on the Friday after Thanksgiving. There was plenty of seating at the gates and there are plenty of dining options from sit down restaurants to fast food. The major drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms. On a busy travel holiday, this meant waiting times of about 10 minutes. Given the number of passengers that fly through the airport daily, renovating and/or expanding bathrooms should be considered.",1
2023-10-29,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will never fly Love Field again,False,"  Love Field is now punishing passengers who choose to be picked up by Uber or Lyft. My arrival was at 8p. The airport was desolate and I discovered I could not be picked up at baggage claim, or even at the entrance where I was dropped off. No signage. My Uber driver told me. No signage or employee to alert passengers they had to go back into the airport, walk all the way back past check-in, up an unmarked escalator, then to the right and down an unmarked endless and not working sky walk to an unmarked elevator to a random spot in parking lot B. They say 10 minutes. MAYBE... if you're an athlete and know where you're going. I literally pushed a stranded and scared woman in a wheelchair. By the time I got to ""the spot"", I was with 20+ other passengers who were also tired, sore and pissed. All drivers had left. I will never fly Love Field again.",-1
2023-09-07,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,"terminal is bright, spacious",True," It's been 4 years since I flew out of this airport. The terminal is bright, spacious and has plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Surprisingly, the airport was not very crowded on the Friday before Labor Day. There was plenty of seating at the gates. The airport has added new dining options from sit down restaurants to fast food. The only drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms. This is the same critique I had 4 years ago when I last flew out of this airport. Given the number of passengers that fly through the airport daily, renovating and/or expanding bathrooms should be considered.",1
2023-03-23,0.5,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,too crowded every time I fly out,True,"  Only two stalls per restroom with long lines, unsanitary conditions. With such a huge traffic, need larger restrooms. This airport needs more seating area. It is just too crowded every time I fly out. The traffic management outside when dropping or receiving passengers is very very messy to say the least.",-1
2022-12-05,0.3,Business,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,1.0,TSA among the rudest and least helpful,False,"  TSA were among the rudest and least helpful that I've encountered. The lines were slow as TSA repeatedly argued with airport employees trying to assist people in wheelchairs through the checkpoints. TSA were sarcastic responding to any questions. Supervisor refused to arrive for 45 minutes to assist me because I had my wallet stolen and needed to use alternate ID. A supervisor never came and i had to reactivate my Clear membership to get through. $189 because none of the herds of TSA employees standing around joking about passengers could do the ID confirmation process. As I result, I got to watch TSA ignore, belittle, and joke about harassing passengers. Absolute garbage, especially with disabled passengers and elderly passengers. I was shocked to watch them make clearly disabled passengers try to stand and walk. One lady, in particular, was confused and crying. Ruthless TSA. Shocking.",-1
2022-02-24,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,customer service reps are unprofessional,False,"  February 21, 2022 I thought I booked the best birthday week to Colorado Springs, Colorado but my return flight was canceled not once but twice! Now I have a flight to Hobby but I need to travel to Houston! To top it off my bags were sent to Denver while I’m on a 12 hour layover to catch another flight! We never booked a connecting flight to Denver! The customer service reps here at Dallas Love/(hate) Airport are unprofessional and showed no since of urgency to help with my luggage location or get another flight! The term “I guess your luggage went to Denver!” rings in my head! I was told to ask Hobby Airport to locate my luggage! I’m highly disappointed with Southwest!",-1
2020-03-02,0.1,Business,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Love Field does not have sanitizer,True," It’s amazing that Coronavirus is a global threat and close quarters contact areas such as Love Field does not have sanitizer. That’s right, no one in the airport has it, all stores sold out. You would think proper planning would be a high priority for this outbreak but it’s not at Love Field. Also no staff has deemed it priority to give a tutorial of manners for coughing and sneezing. As I sit here this morning waiting to board my plane I can’t believe how many people are coughing without at minimum covering their mouth. All airports should be doing their due diligence for this highly infectious virus. But I presume they’ll just wait until it’s too late.",-1
2020-01-29,0.6,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,airport is beyond crowded,False," Arrived on Monday from Portland on Alaska. E-175 (Horizon). My first impression was ""meh"". This airport is beyond crowded thanks to Southwest. I know it has been their home state airport since their beginning but good grief this was beyond anything I have seen in the past few years except for Seattle. Everyone I talked to going there said I would love the airport but that was not the case. 1) Too crowded 2) Too few restaurants 3) No lounges to escape to not even a USO. I will say though that the personnel I interacted with were very friendly and professional on all levels. I fly back to Alaska on Saturday flying back to DAL from LIT. I will check them out again.",1
2019-11-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,TSA employees were of no assistance,False,  I picked up a friend at Love Field today. It is a good thing that the Dallas police were there to answer my questions. The TSA employees were of no assistance and they were about as rude as I have ever experienced. All I needed was a little info. I will never use Love Field for my transportation needs after this experience.,-1
2019-11-02,0.6,Business,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,above average for American airports,True," I've flown out of, into, and transited through this airport quite a few times. It's above average for American airports, for sure, in terms of its accessibility, signage, speed of security (especially for TSA Pre-Check holders), cleanliness, modernity, and spaciousness considering the small size of the airport. The dining and shopping options are more than ample for a small airport, although nothing particularly, uniquely Dallas or Texas, in my opinion. Restrooms and seating are clean, USB chargers are ample. My only complaint is that the Southwest personnel here, from check-in to baggage handling to the gate, are usually on the grumpy side - enough to bring this airport from an 8/10 to a 6/10. The WiFi was also fine, but not exactly fast.",1
2019-10-31,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,I was offered valuable assistance,True," Today at 4.00 pm I was offered valuable assistance by a Love Field Airport employee (in a red shirt and safety vest). I was at ground level (area 4) where I was trying to arrange an Uber ride. My cell phone battery was low and suddenly dropped to 1%. The App didn’t respond to the final command and I didn’t know what to do. I am a senior (76) and was traveling alone from San Jose. He walked with me to the blue van parking, but no vans. He then helped me charge my phone. The App worked and I was able to catch a ride. He cared.",1
2019-03-09,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,has undergone a major renovation,True," This airport has undergone a major renovation since the elimination of the Wright Amendment. The result is a very spacious terminal that is bright and plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. The seating area at the gates can become crowded but that is understandable as this is Southwest's hub and thousands of passengers fly through here each day. There are good dining options from sit down restaurants to fast food. The only drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. There are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms. Given the number of passengers that fly through the airport daily, renovating and/or expanding bathrooms should be considered.",1
2019-01-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,,2.0,0.0,,,,Worst security camera system,False,"  Worst security camera system there is. You'd think an airport would have an outstanding camera system, however, if it's raining or cloudy they're unable to get a license plate number from a car that's parked directly in front of baggage claim. I was in a hit and run and they are unable to get a plate number. Unacceptable! Times are dangerous so you'd think they would have a state of the art system.",-1
2017-10-29,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,There was something for everyone,False,"  This was my first time traveling to/from Dallas Love Field. This airport looks and feels like a world-class airport. The baggage claim area was very spacious. I had no trouble finding car rental van after picking up my bags. During my return flight, the check-in and security experience was smooth. After clearing security, the dining options were similar to what you find at shopping malls. There was something for everyone! I ate Mexican food at Moe's Southwestern Grill, followed by ice cream at Baskin Robbins. Overall, a ""perfect 10"" experience at Dallas Love Field Airport.",1
