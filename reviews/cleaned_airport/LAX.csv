2024-07-16,0.5,Solo Leisure,2,3,,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,“This is just highway robbery!”,False, $10 for this rinky dink breakfast sandwich that has one paper thin small piece of ham on it to call it a ham sandwich. This is just highway robbery!,-1
2024-06-17,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,Some things just never change,True,  To be a premium passenger at Tom Bradley Terminal is deplorable for 2024. The line for a $12k ticket in business class is always horrible. They need a separate line so passengers can enter and start spending money! You lose so much revenue people standing in a line and not buying food or drinks Or retail. Some things just never change and keep LAX in the bottom of airports on the world.,-1
2024-05-27,0.4,Solo Leisure,2,2,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,International terminal very crowded,False,"   Arrive at Alaska air terminal and walked to international. Underground tunnels let you skip shuttle bus. These are very narrow, long and drab and you need bag on rollers. Signage is sparse. International terminal very crowded and seems duty free oriented. Food is limited to very expensive fast fare. Enough seating but few places to charge phone. Not a great to spend 5 hours, but I’ve had worse.",-1
2024-05-15,0.3,Family Leisure,3,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,,“As usual gate changed twice”,True, As usual gate changed twice necessitating walking between terminals. Happened every time visited this airport. Most restaurants shut down at 9:30pm which means no food on internal flights.,-1
2024-04-27,0.2,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,this is unacceptable.,True,"  My family had a stopover in LAX a few weeks ago. My elderly father is disabled and also has a cognitive disability. We told a female LAX employee he can't walk on his own. She offered to drive him on her cart but told us we (my mom, my aunt, and I) we couldn't go with him. Then she drove off without telling us where she was going to drop him off. After we went through security, we did not see my father. We started to panic and frantically looked for him for him all over the airport. We asked a few LAX employees where we could possibly find him. They shrugged and acted like they didn't care. None of them got on their phones or walkie-talkies to communicate with each other. We also informed a customer service agent behind a glass booth and told him we couldn't find my father. He was unhelpful and wouldn't go on a public speaker to page my father. After over an hour, we randomly found my father at an Alaska Airlines counter. The airline we were supposed to fly with was Air Canada. LAX, this is unacceptable. You should let family members travel with disabled passengers and train your staff to communicate with each other and with passengers.",-1
2024-02-20,0.8,Couple Leisure,4,3,4.0,4.0,0.0,,4.0,3.0,"things have changed, for the better",True,"  It's a few years since we last landed or left LAX and things have changed, for the better. Ahead of the game, LAX has installed new scanners so passengers do not have to remove liquids from their bags, liquid sizes seem to be the same as before. Body scanners are widely used and seem to indicate things in pockets or concealed regularly. On entry and leaving it said there was something in the groin area (something unusual that is) causing me to have a very thorough frisking around that area. A few more shops and refreshment options airside now than before. The Star Alliance lounge for my transit and the One World Lounge coming home are okay. Seating was easy to find and the buffet and drinks were plentiful, if simple.",1
2024-02-06,0.4,Family Leisure,4,5,,5.0,0.0,,,2.0,TSA worker was very rude and disrespectful,False,"  After enduring the crazy night traffic of LAX, there was a TSA worker who was very rude and disrespectful, causing a verbal spat between a couple and myself with my mother. We were instructed, by another TSA agent, to find any open space for the bins and use it. A couple in front of us obviously didn't know how this TSA worked, and neither did I, in addition, to taking their time and holding up the line. In the mean time, the older women TSA agent wasn't paying attention and was making small talk with the couple. I had already placed items in 2 bins, and stacked another because she wasn't paying attention and her male co-worker was giving my mom (who was unable to move bins because of surgery) instructions to put a heavier suitcase in a bin. The way the luggage line is set up, there is a divider and the TSA agent has to pull the bins from the customer side to allow them to move toward the xray area on their side to create space. I attempted to maneuver the bins and then waited, but there was still no space in front of me, so I took one of the two spaces that the  couple was not using, because the older TSA agent wasn't paying attention. The TSA agent then gets an attitude with me and tells me that I took the white woman's space that was in front of her; but, the woman of the couple had 2 spaces without bins and she was holding up the line and I needed to get to my flight. So I proceeded to tell the TSA agent that I was helping my mother because he coworker was instructing my mother to put items in a new bin and rushing her along and my mother wasn't able because of her arm, and I asked her, since she wasn't moving the bins in front of me to create space, what did she expect me to do, and she stated to ""hold it (the bin)!"" Really?! I attempted to explain to her that her coworkers instructions and her instructions were conflicting and that I was trying to help my mother. She continued to go back and forth with me. The male coworker was apologetic after we told him of my mother's condition, but the older agent continued to be rude, which caused me to also respond. This could have been resolved if the TSA agent was paying attention and moving the bags along and instructed the female to place her items in one of the spaces and allow me to place my items in the other space. The couple continue to talk about me and the situation and my mother became upset because they were saying I was mean and inconsiderate but that couldn't have been furthest from the truth. The situation only escalated after the couple, along with the TSA agent, continued to be inconsiderate of others trying to make their flights.",1
2024-01-15,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,staff were just absolutely amazing,True,"  I was well on my way to missing my connection flight from Cancun on United to Brisbane via LAX on Qantas. The Cancun delay of 1 hour 30 had changed my connection time to one hour. Usually an impossible task. I was in luck and was travelling using disability services due to a broken foot. The disability services had been arranged for each leg and when I mentioned my predicament the staff were just absolutely amazing. Firstly the lady who name I can’t remember got me through customs and bag pickup in minutes, handed me over to a waiting disability transfer van she had called ahead for. Once in the international terminal a gentleman by the name of Lyn made a personal effort to get me through all the check points radioing ahead to let all staff know he had a passenger whose flight was boarding. Once through all checks he got me on a golf cart and raced me to my gate. Without the tremendous kindness and effort of these staff members I wouldn’t have made it. I made an extra effort to be courteous, kind, thankful and called everybody by name. It’s amazing how far people will go if you are actually thankful and polite. The bus transfer lady and I had a lovely conversation whilst getting between terminals. I’m forever grateful to those individuals. Thank you LAX for giving me the experience I never thought I’d receive.",1
2024-01-06,0.1,Business,1,4,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,I could not get a wheelchair,False, Not inclusive to folks that need assistanc - I waited over an hour before my flight started to board which they never showed up. If you travel to LAX and need assistance don’t expect help here. I actually hurt myself worse because I could not get a wheelchair,-1
2023-12-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,shocked and appalled how bad it was,False, I was shocked and appalled how bad it was. Absolutely filthy and dilapidated.  No markings on where to go. Incredibly slow and crowded. Nowhere to sit. I'm glad I had I 3 hour layover because I spent every bit of it just getting to my connecting flight. TSA was incredibly rude and wouldn't look you in the eye when talking to them.  I still cant believe its an airport on US soil. Its shameful. I will never transit through there again.,-1
2023-12-04,0.2,Family Leisure,2,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,“employees were downright demeaning”,False,"  In all my years of travel, I have never experienced the level of rudeness I did at LAX. The employees I encountered were downright demeaning and seemed to be on some sort of power trip. It was a bummer of a way to end an otherwise great trip.",-1
2023-11-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,4,1,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,never want to go there again,False,"  First time experiencing an American airport. All I can say after travelling the world is rude, aggressive and never want to go there again. If you ask a question or need directions just google it because you will get a better response.",-1
2023-11-13,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,security machines don’t allow water,False,  Terrible; the shuttle bus took one hour to get me there because of airport vehicles chaos; had to walk for km and the security machines don’t allow water,-1
2023-07-18,0.2,Family Leisure,1,4,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,nothing but chaos,False,"  LAX Airport security is horrible. I have a pre-existing condition with high blood pressure and issues with my legs. Was not well when walking through the check point and forgot I had my keys in my pocket. I showed security my keys and they were snatched out of my hand and thrown into the scanner to the left of me. The key ring had all of my keys, from apartment keys to my car keys. Security lost my keys. I submitted an online claim as they apparently do not have a phone number to call, my claim was closed citing could not verify ownership, could not find the missing item. My car key alone when getting back home here in Cleveland was over $200 to replace as it also is a key fob for locking, unlocking, and remote starting my car. The rest of my experience at LAX Airport was nothing but chaos. I understand that there is construction there currently but there needs to be better organization there and Security needs to get it together and not be horrible to everyone that comes through because there may end up being someone that comes through that has a critical condition and the way the mistreat folks might end up sending them to the hospital. Wheelchair assistance was not great as that was request for myself and my mother however only 1 wheelchair was brought to us at the time.",-1
2023-06-11,0.2,Family Leisure,1,2,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,discriminates against people in wheelchairs,True," TSA Security discriminates against people in wheelchairs. Be forewarned, you will need an extra 30+ minutes if they can not walk through a scanner. Tampa International Airport let us skip most of the security line and had someone almost immediately to pat her down and wand her in her wheelchair. LAX gave us no priority in line. Once we arrived at the security gates the rest of my party went through. They held my mom in her wheelchair for 20+ minutes! And no justification other than they want to be lazy and not do their jobs. I highly recommend keeping your handicapped loved ones far from LAX.",-1
2023-03-27,0.1,Family Leisure,5,2,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,worst airport experience ever,True,"  This was my worst airport experience ever. I was traveling with both of my elderly parents, and they transfered us from one set of wheelchairs to another to another to a golf cart, to another set of wheelchairs, to a bus, to another set of wheelchairs, and then the boarding wheelchairs never showed up, and we had a terribly long walk for my parents. My parents had a VERY hard time climbing into the golf carts, and mom nearly fell twice, and on the second golf cart she was not belted in. It´s ridiculous to make elderly people change wheelchairs so many times. It was utterly exhausting for them. At all other airports we have ever been to, it´s one to two sets of wheelchairs and that´s it. I give LAX a ZERO on the scale of 1 to 10. I will avoid traveling to LAX in the future.",-1
2023-02-05,0.9,Business,4,3,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,staff were fantastic,False, Left my headphones on the United Flight from Vegas to LA. I quickly informed the United airport staff about this and I have to say that they were fantastic. She did her best to make sure I got my headphones back. Thank you!,1
2023-01-16,0.4,Couple Leisure,2,2,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,food and drink service is very expensive,True,"  This airport is dated. I fine that several items need to be updated. The ground crew has been changing a tire for over two hours. The food and drink service is very expensive. We had two vodka and soda, one burrito and two tacos. The charge was over sixty five dollars. I know airports are expensive but this seems a bit excessive.",-1
2022-12-15,0.3,Business,3,3,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,TSA Security are so very rude!,False,"  TSA Security are so very rude! They are hollering and rushing you through. They will rudely throw the bin container back to you, if it isn’t to their requirement and not tell you what you did wrong. It’s like a power and control game with them! It’s so terrible!",-1
2022-11-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,"noisy, dirty, ugly, huge but crowded",False," This airport is noisy, dirty, ugly, huge but crowded, and poorly organized. Many of the people working there are not just inconsiderate; they are downright mean. It's a shame this is the first impression of this country by so many international travelers.",-1
2022-10-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst airport I have ever been to,False,"  I was here for a 3 hour layover and this airport sucks. It is the worst airport I have ever been to. Not only is it not clean, but everything is overpriced and the food isn't even worth the $20 per person.  There are very few ""name brand"" restaurants here, so I have to blindly trust that the food here will be decent. There is almost no seating for people to sit in the terminal and it is so bad.",-1
2022-09-25,0.7,Family Leisure,1,5,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,impressed with the experience,True,"  My review only focusses on the Tom Bradley International Terminal, so, for any other terminals within LAX, I cannot comment. LAX is generally a good airport, the arrival area is nice until you get to the immigration area. It is small and some of the screens were glitching. It seemed tatty too. After an 11-12 hour flight, it isn't the best thing waiting for an hour and a half in the queue either. Having said that, the vibe was calm and staff seemed organised with the queue system. None of the staff were rude or pushy. Signage could be improved for arrivals. There is a nicely lit and futuristic tunnel once you've cleared immigration and you can take a shuttle bus to LAX-it (their Uber/Lyft stand). Great idea but too expensive! Very disappointed that there isn't a metro/train service yet, being from the UK. I am aware that in late Autumn 2022, there will be a people mover connecting out from LAX. The Departures is very nice. Like Arrivals, the staff are organised. However, it is easy to quickly get through and to get to Airside. Airside feels a lot like Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar; think of it as a compliment LAX! The shops are generally good, however, food options could be better. The layout was simple but effective. The airy area, shops and screens definitely gave the area a nice metropolitan feel. Getting to your gate is super easy. Overall, was impressed with the experience, was very surprised as I had low expectations for a US airport.",1
2022-06-25,0.1,Business,1,2,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Absolutely disgraceful,True,"  Absolutely disgraceful. Apparently nobody working at the US Customs and Border Protection. Nothing like getting off a 14 hour flight then waiting in a 2 hour immigration line. Absolutely avoid flying in to LAX if any other option is available at all. Despicable lack of signage and crowd control. People were piling up on the moving walkways with nowhere to go like the chocolates in I Love Lucy, which was downright dangerous. Shameful, shameful showing from the airport staff here.",-1
2022-06-01,0.3,Couple Leisure,3,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,just organized chaos,False,"  LAX continues to be one of the worst airport experiences I can remember after years of traveling experience. Always improving but never improved, just organized chaos.",-1
2022-05-06,0.3,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Very bad experience,True,  Very bad experience. Staff was not very helpful I have to walk from terminal 6 down to terminal 3 and back to terminal 2 to get my boarding pass then back to terminal 3 again for security because I was told terminal 2 was closed by the security officers immigration guys. I almost missed my flight because of this. And so many constructions going on and prompting and instructions was not clear enough and very confusing. I will not use this airport any longer until they make some changes.,-1
2022-05-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,homeless men and women sleeping all over the building,True,"  Upon arriving at Terminal 1, my sister and I kept seeing people sleeping on the ground in the terminal (before TSA check in). We at first thought they were waiting for a connecting flight but then realized they were filthy and had belongs in trash bags with them. Flying back into LAX at 10 pm we were shocked to see even more homeless men and women sleeping all over the building. No one is doing anything about this! What an awful first time coming to California and your first impression will be of homeless people all over the airport.",-1
2022-04-23,0.1,Business,5,1,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,3.0,a very unpleasant experience,True,"  Went in through terminal 4 departures to get to gate 151 to fly back to Texas Security smooth, efficient and the staff all nice, great job. ALL motorized walkways and escalators switched off. Had to dangerously carry heavy bags and cases up a non working escalator. Then to get to the departure gate back down a non working escalator. Departure gate seats covered in other passengers trash and just left. All in all a very unpleasant experience. Most concerning if all is the strong likelihood someone would have a serious accident walking Up and down escalators which appear to be just switched off to save money as the terminal not That busy. Disgraceful !",-1
2022-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1,3,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,It was embarrassing and disrespectful,False,"  TSA at this airport are extremely rude and unprofessional. I just got off 2 back to back 11 hour flights from India and was very jet-lagged. Went through security and since it was my first time at LAX and was in a brain fog I didn’t move my bin right away to make space for the next person. A TSA security woman yelled at me saying I was taking up all the space and yelled “So selfish!” rudely in front of everyone. It was embarrassing and disrespectful. She could have kindly asked me to move along. Another TSA worker spoke disrespectfully to my mom when she didn’t understand what he was saying, he spoke to her like a child when she has a mental illness disability. On top of that 3 people refused to take my mom in her requested wheelchair because they didn’t feel like taking another connecting flight and were visibly annoyed. Ridiculous, unprofessional, disrespectful staff and things are not run efficiently. Made me not want to travel to LAX again.",-1
2022-04-12,0.3,Family Leisure,4,1,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,Bad signage for arrivals,False,  Found the bins at security check-in and floors throughout to be absolutely filthy. Bad signage for arrivals to find rental cars. Otherwise quick and efficient security check-in.,-1
2021-12-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,nowhere near enough space or seating,True,"  This is the worst airport I have ever experienced in the USA. People are crammed into the departure gates like cattle as there is simply nowhere near enough space or seating. My pregnant wife was left sitting on the hard floor for hours while we waited, being stepped on and over the entire duration. With covid in full force, I felt very uncomfortable in this incedibly claustrophobic small space. I have never felt the need to review a single thing in the past but felt it was important to draw attention to the situation lax has allowed, leaving their passengers trapped, exposed and abused. Expand your airport or do not allow your airport to reach this capacity. This is unacceptable in today's social distance world and masks are not sufficient. Also, I feel it is worth mentioning that if you manage to find a spot to sit and eat, the food is beyond horrible.",-1
2021-10-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,2,5,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Do not fly your pets through this airport,True,"  Do not fly your pets through this airport, especially if you're checking in. If the right people are not working, they'll refuse you a private room for screening, and make you wait at the normal security checkpoints. Theirs is super disorganized. They made us wait 15 minutes while holding our cats in our arms. After they let multiple people pass us without pets go, we asked when we would be able to go through. The person working the line got angry with us and said you're going last. We had to wait for a few too many more people out of their spite. You all just lost my business.",-1
2021-08-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the people who work there are uncaring and unhelpful,False,"  Dirty, no parking, smells like marijuana and the people who work there are uncaring and unhelpful. You are processed through from baggage to boarding like cattle. Even the LAPD assigned there for traffic duty are unprofessional. I watched as three of them in vests marked traffic control stood and cussed and gossiped while the traffic was mayhem. There are other airports in S. California, use them.",-1
2021-07-15,0.1,Business,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,LAX continues to be the worst airport,True," LAX continues to be the worst airport. Coming back to travel after COVID and transmitting thru LAX was so disappointing. Not enough seats for passengers at the gate. Few bathrooms. Buses from regional planes instead of airjets. Terminals still not connected past security after twenty years, you have to take a bus or go out and back thru security if you change terminals. They should hire whoever made MSP awesome. I avoid this airport like a plague, very disappointed I had to connect thru here.",-1
2021-07-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,Barely any places for people to sit,False,"  This is the worst airport ever - from my experience. Barely any places for people to sit and long lines all over the place. TSA workers are rude as anything here. They like to yell and talk to you in a condescending tone, like you're dumb - typical character. Their training must be to treat every individual like a threat. Always the worst part of my trips whenever visiting this city. Horrible signage on shuttles for car rentals as well - no thorough instructions posted like Vegas Airport.",-1
2021-06-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1,2,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,they will miss their flight due to this inefficiency,False,"  Reviewing for my sister and brother in law, who are in line trying to get to their plane. They were in CA to care for our 94 year old father, who was hospitalized, then recovering at home, not a vacation. The terminal was unable to handle the numbers of people, and there are two blocks lined up outside the terminal for checking baggage. Although they were at the airport hours early, they will miss their flight due to this inefficiency. They are now in another extremely long line at Special Services. There is no reason for this other than extreme inefficiency on the part of the airport, and the over-booking by American Airlines. Travel for family emergencies should never be this difficult.",-1
2021-06-23,0.8,Family Leisure,3,5,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,Thank you so much for your efforts,False,"  This review is specifically for a woman who worked in over size baggage, Serena. Thank you so much for your efforts. This woman not only throes to find my children’s tickets information, but she personally ran with my kids and I to make our flight. She took my children to their seats I felt like we were in the movie home alone lol. I saw what our surroundings were and it was chaotic. Thank you for night just telling me to turn left turn a mother left and have a good day. You were amazing. My kids made their flight to see their grandparents today because of you. I hope you have a great day and I hope someone acknowledges you for your work.",-1
2021-05-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,2,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,got to be the worst airport in the world,True,"  Literally the worst airport I have been to - barely any place to sit, dirty and literally just had 4 or 5 pathetic food joints (Panda Express, KFC etc.). If that was not enough, I have never had to deal with a more rude and uncouth staff than here. I was travelling with a couple of tech items and the rude lady at security started screaming (yes, screaming) contradictory instructions at me while I was simply getting everything on the trays. Later, while I was trying to remove and assemble my things from 4 trays after passing through security, I have another lady telling me thrice to stack up my trays. In which airport is that the job of a passenger? Every airport I have ever been to either uses belts that automatically stack these up or airport personnel do this manually. How is a passenger supposed to be stacking trays with hands full of expensive things that need to be repacked? Would recommend flying via SFO instead because LAX has got to be the worst airport in the world in every possible aspect.",-1
2021-05-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,the worst airport I’ve experienced,True," LA international airport is the worst airport I’ve experienced, seriously, in the world. And I’ve travelled to a lot of places. I felt the same way when I came through this airport about 5 years ago, but it was under construction of some kind so I assumed there was good reason. Nope, still appalling. No construction today but equally dismal. Shocking really, an embarrassment to America. Nowhere to sit other than the gates and a handful of dirty tables in a food course (7!) – and no plug points available for people needing to charge devices (well all apparently deliberately turned off), despite the obvious necessity), and no real food – all fast food, at absurdly exorbitant costs. I paid $20 for one fish taco (takeaway fast food) and a beer. As my first stop in my homeland after 3 years, I feel like getting on the next plane out again. Shame on you LA airport designers! Horrific. Then one is bombarded by continuous loud repetitive messaging from megaphones. Seriously, take a trip to Paris and learn a bit of class for pleasurable airport environment – that is, if you care about customer experience.",-1
2021-03-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,3,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,The airport is even worse than it used to be,False,"  I have always avoided the LAX airport given how busy and lacking of services I have found in the past. Our flight was changed and rather than connecting through San Francisco we connected through LAX. The airport is even worse than it used to be. Extremely dirty, and run down. I am sure there are some Covid restrictions in play but this is the only airport to which I have traveled where almost all food establishments are closed. For the entire Alaska terminal there were just three very busy very dirty places in operation.",-1
2021-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,3,4,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,rude and unhelpful behavior,True," I am writing this because of the rude and unhelpful behavior that was portrayed. I was attempting to locate a bathroom and terminal 2, when I accidentally walked through the exit gate. I walked 15 feet into the hallway and realized my mistake. I did attempt to return through the gate and was stopped. I explained that I was trying to find the bathroom and I just got off a plane and was connecting to another. The security person wanted to look at my boarding pass so I showed it to her. She said this is not a boarding pass and would not let me return to the terminal. I said I just got off a plane and I am not going to go through security, I had to reprint my boarding pass, wait in line for tsa screening. I just made it back to my gate as it was boarding. No one was helpful. I was very very angry at the situation.",-1
2020-12-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,LAX should not be open at all,True," You haven't seen and experienced the worst part of this LAX airport. This is an update of the review I posted yesterday. I missed two consecutive days of flights at LAX because of Copa Airline's lack of communication, systems malfunction, and also the incompetency of the Copa Airline's rude staff at LAX airport. I now found out that my return flight for this trip that didn't happen has been mysteriously changed to a day earlier. I didn't make a request to change the return date because I never make it to the destination. I'm waiting until later today to get to the Copa counter to talk to someone there and make my request, so I do not understand how this happened.

2020-10-19,0.1,Family Leisure,3,2,,3.0,,,,1.0,just unacceptable behavior,False,"  Worst experience I’ve ever had within the first 10 minutes of being here. Now let me preface this with a large thank you to those working under the circumstances of a pandemic. This is not easy work and I appreciate those who come to work everyday. I understand that many things have changed and are changing to accommodate COVID-19 mandates and regulations. With that being said, I am still a customer and expect a certain standard of customer service.  First we walk in and have already checked in online so no need to go to the kiosks. My father and I walk over to go through TSA. A gentleman asks to see our boarding pass. This ain’t where they scan the boarding pass by the way. So my father shows him his boarding pass on his phone and the gentleman walks away from us. A few seconds later he walks over to us and in a raised tone asks to see my boarding pass. So my father shows him my boarding pass on his phone. The gentleman proceeds to tell us in a raised and non-neutral tone that why would we think to not to shows the other pass. Okay, I get your point but isn’t it unprofessional to speak to people that way. AND you didn’t even look at the boarding pass. So we go in line, ignoring the guy still ranting to us and go to scan out boarding passes. The names were switched for our seats and were showing up wrong on the phone and his scanner. Instead of being patient and working with us to see what was wrong, he rolls his eyes and says “my computer says something different so I can’t let you pass”. Again, totally understand that is a rule that you must follow. However, there’s no need to roll your eyes because we are just as confused as you. We the. Go through TSA. What an absolute mess. Everything is so backed up by the continue to let people go through. So after you go through the scanner you need to wait in line AGAIN to get your belongings. And by wait in line I mean for 5 minutes. Doesn’t seem like a long time but ideally it should take one minute for my belongings to be checked after I have been scanned. There are workers standing around chatting it up instead of helping their coworkers. What kind of team is that? I just don’t understand what kind of place would allow their workers to speak to customers in those tones. Now, it’s not like we raised our voices first. I’m all for customer service employees to stand up for themselves when being disrespected. No one should have to put up with that. However, we never raised our voices or put blame onto the workers yet we were disrespected because? Don’t forget those workers who are doing their job. Especially with a pandemic, there’s no reason for extra people to just be standing around. You are increasing their risk and the risk of others. This is just unacceptable behavior.",-1
2020-10-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this airport has some serious issues,False,"  Don't fly in or out of here! This airport is a joke, and I’ve flown all around the country, by far this airport has some serious issues with pretty much everything. The terminals are being remodeled, so we got off and onto a bus that dropped us off at a door that then took us back into the airport to get extremely lost because, why would you put direction signs? Getting your car from the car rental is another chore that you get to wait for a bus to take you to. Don’t let me get started on that complete mess, no organization, poor customer service, it took us from the airport to actually getting the car over an hour! On our departure, we got dropped off at the bottom level baggage claim by our lovely, being so sarcastic here, car rental bus driver. Again, no signs of directions to anything! Finally figuring things out on our own, because apparently no one works here at 6 am, getting through TSA was pure hell! I’ve never been talked down to, yelled at, or felt like I was doing something wrong, this is exactly how I felt the entire experience going through TSA. It really solidified me never flying into or out of LAX ever again. Fly into Long Beach of John Wayne Orange County.",-1

Endless mazes to walk through when entering from international. Dirty. Crowded. Staff yelling at people and this was at 6am. Avoid this airport. I saw signs that 1.2 billion was being spent to modernize - will it be enough? Door alarms repeated sounded and many people had to cover their ears. I gave an overall rating of 1 - I did make the connection (barely) and got through the place but it was an unpleasant experience all around.,-1

The staff/officers on the ground are rude and are not helpful at all. I checked with 4 different officers, that I have a connecting flight in 2 hours and my visa type is L2. I was just told with a loud voice ""I said, all passengers in one queue"". Result: I had to wait in the queue, go to the kiosk, enter my details which only indicated that the kiosk does not accept L2 visa and I need to continue to go to the customs queue (what a waste of time!). And then the customs queue again was one single queue (All visa types, all transiting passengers). I missed my connecting flight and had to wait 6 hours for the next flight. Had even one officer said, your Visa goes directly to the customs queue or if there was clear signage, it would have saved 6 hours of my life! Safe to say, for a passenger the airport staff is the first contact with the country. And LAX is failing miserably at representing the USA. If someone from the airport is reading this review, you only need the following queues at immigration: 1) US and Canadian citizens --> Use the dedicated mobile passport area (no queuing required) 2) One queue for Transit cardholders (to a country outside the US) 3) One queue for connecting flight (within the US) boarding pass holders 4) One queue for people actually immigrating It will only make passengers but also your life easier. One thing is for sure, I'm not transiting from LAX ever again.",-1

Since I am new to living in LA, I didn’t know it was Terminal 1. Took my 40 min to drive 10 miles and when I got to the terminal there was no clear signage that stated where to pick up arrivals. I called my friend and while I was on the phone with her, within 10 seconds, an airport cop told me to keep driving and go all the way around to pick her up. He knew very well that it’d take me another 30-40 min to do that. I responded “my friend is right there!” as she was walking towards us. Within a minute, he decides to write me a $100 ticket. I’ve been in NY all my life - been to JFK, LGA and other airports. Never In my life have I received a ticket at an airport. A minute cost me $100. I was devastated.

This is a ridiculous and appalling standard for what is meant to be one of the biggest international airports in the USA. I know the reason is that they're building a train but this should have been done years ago and having your customers walk for 30 minutes with their bags or risk missing their flights is not an option. They have largely solved the Arrivals traffic issue by having the rideshare cars now pick up at LAX-it - why not do the same for the Departures?,-1
2020-01-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,LAX is hopelessly jammed with traffic,True," LAX is hopelessly jammed with traffic, but worse, is the fact that they removed 95% of their seating outside the security entry points. Imagine flying from abroad into LAX, having to go through customs with your bags, but not being able to check your bags for the flight out to wherever you live, as the flight leaves more than 4 hours from arrival. You are stuck outside the security checkpoints, yet have no place to sit, except on the concrete floors. (I was told the reason is that the 100s of homeless people took all the seating, so they removed it!).",-1

Why do transit passengers have to go through the 3! stages of passport control just to board their original plane? Passport control staff were (quote) “at the end of shift” and were more focussed on leaving work than getting the backlog of passengers through. Eventually transit passengers were “fastracked “ through with a simple stamp. Why can’t this be done in the first place? 2 hr layover - 5 minutes to get to the gate after passport control.

I still find it hard to believe if you are in America you go through a different line, can anyone tell me why? I do sense that this airport is under staffed, every time I fly to the USA I Dred going through LAX customs.

We had a flight at 9.30, we left our home at 5.00 am and arrived at 7.00 in LAX but unfortunately took us another 1 hour to reach terminal 7, we missed our flight because we weren't able to check in before 1 hour, we were late by 10 min and then I talked to customer service who wasn't very helpful and was just showing an attitude and replying that no you can't get on that flight.

You can’t get a taxi at the curb, you have to walk or shuttle to a funnelled location and stand in line for 30-minutes and then fight with traffic trying to leave cause everyone is funnelled to one location. Ridiculous that you can’t get a yellow cab curbside. Uber and Lyft (discount providers) should be the only ones that have to be outside the airport.

The road leading to the terminals are inadequate to handle the private cars, shuttles, taxis, buses, etc. Make serious time adjustment before departure or else you will miss your flight.",1
2019-10-22,0.5,Family Leisure,2,2,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Arrival into TBIT not too onerous,False,  Arrival into TBIT was not too onerous overall but beware if your departure from TBIT is from gate 138 or thereabouts as these are described as bus gates. The whole part of that building was bus station like with only one small shop. It was very much amateur hour that evening on gate 138 because the check in staff had been looking without success for a bus coordinator for the last 90 minutes. No bus coordinator equals no bus!. We eventually boarded a bus and were taken out to a remote stand (not BAs fault as they were also keen to point out). Then we had to walk up a series of ramps to board the aircraft. Terminal 4 at this airport is a lot nicer overall.,1

They give you poor choices for food and they cram you in like sardines. Barely anywhere to sit. I give it ten thumbs down if I had ten thumbs. I don’t know why we give them a good area.

I was there for 12 hours. No people-movers, you have to walk for miles. No grocery stores like in France. No bars. No vending machines. I spent the first six hours trying to find a place to charge my phone. There are a few outlets next to the restrooms, but they were all taken. This is the worst airport I've ever been to. The last six hours were spent trying to find a place to sit! This airport is a joke. I've been to many, many airports and this is the least passenger-friendly airport I've ever been to.

I was there to pick up a passenger arriving on KLM from Amsterdam. It was difficult to know where to park. It was impossible to know where to meet arrivals. We were sent by an employee to Terminal 2. It was a very long walk from Terminal B, where it turned out we should have been to meet the passenger. There was very inadequate signage. Non-existent information with current arrivals and flight time. Very unfriendly employees. We are both in our 80’s. Not enough seats. Physically grueling.

Baggage reclaim was 10 mins and only because the oversized baggage guy didn’t have a clue or certainly didn’t want to help. The convoluted entry system, really?? That’s no way to treat people, non US citizens or not. It’s disgusting. Queue after queue, long and slow. Hang your heads is shame.

In confusion, I pulled over and asked for clarification and direction. Within 10 seconds, my husband entered the car, but I noticed the officer noted my plates. Still in confusion, I asked the officer what he was trying to tell me in motioning. He refused to explain but told me I would be getting a ticket. He refused to provide his last name. This, with a very smug attitude, leaving me in further confusion, now in stress. What was he motioning to me? Why was he noting my plates? Why did he say he was ticketing me? Why wouldn’t he explain? Why was he so smug and disrespectful? I've never been so confused, stressed, and treated with such disrespect.

It’s like do we just keep kicking the can down the road or overhaul this hell hole. Has the worst parts of Philly airport, taking busses between terminal transfers, but none of the good things. I get this place was planned out way back in the day but get with the program, maybe they can’t overhaul LAX because Cali is bankrupt, who knows.

Then on top of our flight being delayed 2 hours and 45 minutes without a reason why, we were forced to wait near the terminals where there was about 1/3 of the seating as there were people in the terminals. Tons of empty space there could have been seating installed. Floors absolutely disgusting with trash and food everywhere on top of broken down restrooms. By far the most awfully designed and maintained terminal I've ever had to wait in my life, including 3rd world countries I've traveled to and from that were more nice than this. This place should be shut down especially for how greedy they are with flight prices on top of every single flight I've booked this month being delayed and only one being from an actual weather issue which I understand is out of the airports control and didn't make a fuss about. However, now its like they're simply taking advantage of the people not having any other option to traveling in most cases.",-1

Newark is the worst but LAX is a close second. TSA is usually at least ambilavent with their attitude but slow always. There is never enough chairs in the terminal, I usually sit on the floor. Much worse though, is the attendants outside who shoo away people trying to pick up their loved ones. These guys could not be more rude about this literally every single time. The power goes to their heads in such a pathetic way. I’m waiting for my mom and he asks me to go all the way around again, but I can see her she’s just zipping up a bag and this guy starts writing my license plate number down and taking pictures of me. Even when you do move like they want you to, they will just harass you again when you come back around. They act like you came to the airport just to annoy them and there is no necessity for their job. I feel bad because they do just want to keep the line moving but I’ve never seen the arrivals get that cramped that they need this weird pickup queue gustappo.",-1

We arrived with a reasonable amount of time to met our connecting flight. We arrived at the at immigration to find a huge very slow moving queue. They only had about a quarter of the booths open and no one wanted to help us at all. It took 1.5 hours to be processed. We asked several staff if they could help us get to our flight on time and not one person offered any help at all. There was no one to help us get from terminal B to 6 so had to run, which is no mean feat when you are in your 70s. We later found out there is a shuttle which no one told us about. We made our plane but only after member of the public let ups jump the xray queue. On our return trip through your airport we found the signage difficult and at no stage could we find directions to shuttles. This time we were on terminal 7 going to B. We took the wrong option and walked all the way. There is so much you could do to improve your service and I hope that by our next experience things may have changed.

",False,"  Because of my ridiculous 13 hour layover I couldn't check my bags until 6 hours before my departure. Unfortunately the area of the airport that you can access with bags that still need to be checked only has barstool style seating, or you could just sit on the ground. I have a bad hip. So you know how much it hurts to have to either sit on barstool type chairs, which are really high, or sit on the ground, which is really low, when you have a bad hip? Obviously not or you'd put some regular chairs in somewhere for your handicapped, but not handicapped enough to want to be embarrassed by using a wheelchair when you don't need to, customers.

",True," Oh, where to start. I've been through Riyadh airport (apparently the worst in the world) during a blackout and had a better experience than transiting through LAX. Twice. Both times 4 hour layover, first transit waited for almost 3 hours at immigration and had to run to make my flight. About a third of fellow passengers missed their connections. There were 3 or 4 officers checking passports and another 15 or so mall cops standing around barking orders and generally being unhelpful. Return trip, went through immigration in about 15 minutes but was then told by three seperate employees to go to the wrong terminal. The last was 'Information' desk who told me, with rather shameless dismissiveness, not to worry that my flight wasnt on the departure board. Then went through security to find, surprise, surprise, I was in the worng terminal. There is no information desk airside, eventually had to accost some maintenance workers who kindly made some calls to direct me to the correct terminal. Why this was so hard is incompletely beyond comprehension. Note, I had checked in at the time if my first leg, so gate details were not on my boarding pass. Eventually got to the gate to find people flayed across the ground - for some reason the gate had no seats. By this stage the overwhelming incompetency became comical and I had a good laugh. There were another few terrible encounters with outright obnoxious staff at LAX which on another day I would have cared more about. Allow at least 4 hours for transit and also meditate or pray beforehand (depending on your disposition). I would say avoid but unfortunately there aren't many options.",-1

",False,"  A lot of the reviews for LAX here are harsh and exaggerated. Personally I think this is an excellent airport, especially the Tom Bradley Terminal. I flew in from Sydney on April 15 and was through immigration and customs in less than 10 minutes. For those of you thinking that was a lucky fluke, this was not my first time getting through this airport quickly on arrival, despite numerous other international flights arriving around the same time (6am). The staff were all courteous. I admit the other terminals need some work and the traffic is bad but they are doing a lot of construction. Orlando and JFK remain the worst airports in the US. LAX and DFW are both excellent.",1

Ladies & Gentlemen : Exhibit A The Los Angeles Airport A 3rd World, 3rd Class Airport. LAX got its last renovation back in 1984 when the Olympics were in town. Thats about 35 years ago! That is the type of vibe Los Angeles Airport has. The Airport that time forgot. One of the major paradoxes in the world is that Los Angeles gets more visitors than practically anywhere else in the world. Fourth to be Exact for this year. And yet it is an International embarrassment to walk to one and through one. This is even far more true for domestic travels. Yes, I'm pretty sure Joe Biden flew into LAX and that is when he famously is quoted for ""Some of these Airports we have here in the US are 3rd world in class."" There is nothing in these Airports you will ever take your camera and pose with. And that - is tragically - pathetic. How do you spell LAX? P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. You have Hollywood right here. Legions of iconic celebrities. Monroe. Hepburn. James Dean. Legions of classy world class photographs and you see not one anywhere in this sorry excuse of an airport. How bad Los Angeles Airport is, it a testimony to how pathetic the city's leaders are. No vision. No Class. Just like their airport. A 3rd World Airport. I was here, unfortunately, just this month in April for a flight out with United. Dear God, will someone take a photo of this horror - this sorry excuse for an Airport - and put it next to photos from the Airport in Munich, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore or anywhere else in the world. Suffice it to say, Los Angeles Airport - for a world class destination - is firmly cemented in a 3rd world class reputation. If you can avoid the LAX Los Angeles Airport - do so - it is like a Plague. Its not like me to criticize without offering resolutions. Disney. Universal Studios. Have them sponsor a renaissance into the world of tomorrow. Have them foot the bill sponsoring something more World Class than 3rd class, 3rd world class, only worthy of condemnation, by the likes of Vice President Joe Biden.",-1

I have been diagnosed with severe degenerative disk disease and cannot walk very far at a time. We set out from a domestic terminal at one end of the airport to the international terminal. We had our suitcases in a cart and kept asking employees which way to go. When we reached the end of the building, I asked a group of chatting employees how to reach the international terminal for our flight to Singapore. The female of the group said to go outside and walk about ten minutes and we would be there. She could see my cane, there is no doubt we are elderly and that my husband was pushing a large cart of four suitcases. I asked if that was the only way since it was raining outside and she smiled and said yes. She gave us no indication that there are shuttle buses for travelers so we started walking. It might be 10 minutes for a young person, but it took us at least 30 minutes. Time was not a problem, exhaustion was. We finally made it to the international terminal where there are very few seats...maybe one per 50 passengers. Our airline counter was not yet open so we stood and waited as seats became available. After a couple of hours, I needed to find a restroom which was a very long walk from where we were. No seats and no restrooms. Once we checked in, we were told that it was a very long way to our gate. That was an understatement. Our airline, Singapore Airlines, was the last gate at the farthest end of that terminal. We walked and rested and walked and rested. We were passed up by many carts carrying people. How are you supposed to get a cart? I had asked before we flew if we could get them and was told you just had to happen upon them. We never did, but others sure did. Later I realized that many people waited at the plane upon exiting and the carts were brought to them yet I was told this could not be done for us. The capper to all of this was when we were finally allowed to board, we were taken out into the rain and very strong wind to a bus, from the bus, we climbed stairs onto our plane. I felt like I was back in primitive 1970s Iran. Upon our return, we had a very tight connection and had to get from the international terminal to a domestic terminal. The first employee I saw when we deplaned was a nice man who handed us two orange express connection passes. We took those and rushed for our baggage so we could go thru customs before boarding a domestic flight. We thought those passes would help, but they served no purpose whatsoever. We went to the back of the line just like everyone else. They would have signs directing us to the express connection lines, but they were no faster than regular lines. At least this time I found a kind employee who told us there were shuttle buses we could take to the domestic terminal. That was very helpful, but we rushed as fast as we could and were told there was no way we could make our flight. We will never go thru LAX again. Why no help for disabled travelers? Why do you have to go outside to another terminal? Visit Changi airport in Singapore to see a truly amazing airport. They have lounges you can sleep on, free foot massage machines, clean restrooms, lots of seating, helpful employees and even a nature walk. Even the tiny airport in Dunedin, NZ, is better organized and cleaner than LAX. LAX is crowded, dirty and poorly planned. I consider it the slum of airports and I've seen some pretty pathetic ones in the Middle East.",-1

It was not busy when we arrived Feb 5, 2019, 7:30am so after almost 25 hours travel time we were walking slowly and she said ""move faster, what are you afraid of?"". Then the male personnel at the customs was also rude when he pointed us to the secondary inspection. He said ""go to letter a, don’t you know letter aaaaaaa?"" We are Filipino American professional friends who vacationed together and we are slower but not dumb. We understand the letter a. We were treated way better in other international airports and to be treated this way by our fellow Americans is just unacceptable. The screening of our bags did not produce any ""banned items"" like they ""expected"" coming from the Philippines. We came from Incheon airport and I accidentally forgot to eat a fully wrapped individual banana and the male personnel made it appear a intentionally committed ""crime"". He asked for my passport back and obviously typed something on the computer. When I asked what’s with the passport, he said ""what we do with your passport is none of your business"".

I have travelled this route several times over the last few years and never experienced quite such lengthy and convoluted queues for Immigration. We reached the automatic scanning machines reasonably quickly but then were made to join another queue which spiralled around the arrivals hall, it took 2 hours to reach the manned desk where we were obliged to undergo repeat fingerprint and photography. Why twice for passengers who are only waiting for a plane to be serviced during a 2 hour transit? All that our airline staff could do was to call out that the plane would wait for us! I was then subjected to aggressive questioning around the item which I was legitimately carrying as documented, checked in luggage safely stowed in the hold of the aircraft. Officers threatened that they would unload my luggage for inspection and I would be forced to miss my flight. My passports were confiscated during this process and I was made to wait on the border with no id documents. Three officers discussed this between themselves, none of them asked me for the documentation and I was treated like a criminal. When their supervisor finally arrived after about 20 minutes of this she instructed them to let me go and board the plane which was by this time waiting for me.

Signage is awefull. Good luck finding which way you need to go and employees are no help other than saying keep moving. TSA was a real joy as well. No communication skills at all. Xray machine broke and instead of letting us know they had started moving our stuff to another line we were all just standing around looking at each other wondering whats going on.

There are times I want to get food at the limited selection of restaurants, but don't have time to go because the bus schedules are unpredictable. So then your option is the very underwhelming gas style deli counters and vending machines. I'd understand if this was a small airport, but this is a major international hub.

When we experienced frustration at being told by one staff member that we need not take anything out of our bags when going through security checks and then another reprimanded us for not taking anything out we were told not to come back to America. Staff need to be aware most travellers are just coming off long international flights and just need them to engage in a welcoming manner. A smile occasionally is welcomed. International travellers are not all criminals. We have lives and families just the same as these ‘welcoming’ staff members.

I am unsure as to why they had a delay, but imagine it could have been technical - these are overseas planes we are talking about and I am all for them being as safe as possible. The problem was the lack of care I experienced at the airport. When I relayed my nerves about getting to the place on time, the staff seemed apathetic about it. Sure enough, I missed my flight by about five minutes. Like my luggage made it on, but not me kind of close. Now if even one of them had cared enough to offer me a ride or radio the plane to wait, this could have been avoided. Most of them could see that the time was close and even remarked on it, but made no move to actually help me with the problem. But instead, through no fault of my own, I am currently waiting an over six hour layover with no guarantee I will even get on the next flight.

LAX should be ashamed of themselves, treating your customers like cattle. The stress of arriving to (and from) the airport (and it's not just the new construction). Cattle going to the slaughter house are treated more humanely than the unfortunate people who frequent LAX airport. The only slight relief was the refreshment area which lasted one second till he told me the price of a bottle of water. Shame on you. Were we paying for all that excessive marble and advertising glitz in Arrivals? (Thats a whole different complaint). You should be looking at how other airports address the traffic. Barcelona for one, who separate the buses, shuttles, taxis etc from the cars. Its a great stressless experience. Great unassuming restaurants that you pay reasonable prices, shops that cater to the masses instead of the wealthy. Your mantra seems to be grab as much money as you can from the unsuspecting victims and then wait for them to complain. Shame, shame on you. The employees are miserable and rude, not a smile or welcome from any of them. Being shuttled like cattle to the airplane in a miserable over crowded bus. Shame shame. Look at Gatwick airport, where they have a hotel in the airport for early morning travelers, where they have a train station that is an elevator floor away from check in. Stressless and a great experience. LAX is a stressful money grabbing people barking orders mass of confusion. Hateful experience. I would like my money back for the excessive price of the bottled water. Shame. When I return I will no doubt have a horrible experience but when I glance at the marble and the glitz of the advertising my thought would be ""why did they spend the money on this instead of finding a way to eliminate the lines, the traffic, the confusion, the miserable employees, the expensive shops and the the most unwelcome airport ever.",-1

There is a huge traffic jam getting to and from these flights, with passengers waiting up to 20 minutes to even board a short bus. The annex terminal has few services, with only a small deli for food. They do have a lounge out there, but were not selling day passes that day, due to construction at the lounge in another concourse. Like most of LAX, you get kicked off the WiFi every 45 minutes, unless you watch an ad or pay. While my flight was fine, the ground services and facilities from American Eagle at LAX are as bad as it gets.",-1

TSA needs to improve, they are rude, unorganized and plainly the worst employees. The process is slow and they treat us like criminals without reason and to make it worse we pay the consequences of their inefficiencies. No one is holding them accountable something needs to change and improve the process. They need more training and made me miss my international flight after my bag was re-scanned 3 times because the bin “was dysfunctioning” and the scanner did not “take a picture.” That occurred multiple times before changing the bin. Then my partner was calling to relay information to the gate, but they would not allow me to even answer my phone which was ringing right in front of me, they treated me like a criminal for wanting to answer my phone. So I missed my international flight. I wanted to make sure this did not happen to others so I submitted a claim/complaint but nothing happened and no one did anything, we didn’t even get an apology let alone reimbursement or an assurance that they will improve and not let this happen again.",-1
2018-05-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,main criticism is the baggage carousel breakdown,False,"  After arriving I was put on a later connecting flight to Seattle with Delta Airlines instead of Alaska Airlines due to the delayed arrival of my Qantas flight, from Australia. The nightmare started after I entered the LAX international terminal, The first bad experience was the baggage carousel, which was going to handle my flights luggage, broke down. They waited for 30 minutes before deciding to bring my flights luggage through another carousel. This was putting catching my new connecting flight at risk. I finally got my checked luggage, cleared customs and was directed to the connecting flights area. After another 30 minute wait, my luggage was checked in on a Delta Airlines flight and instead of a boarding pass, given an A4 piece of paper and told curtly to go to terminal 2. At the crowded terminal 2 I was curtly told by terminal 2 staff to use one of the check in kiosks. The kiosk would not accept the information on the sheet of paper. Luckily some Qantas passengers, who were in the same predicament as me found someone who finally gave me my boarding pass. I finally got to the boarding gate with 10 minutes to spare. To sum it up, my main criticism is the baggage carousel breakdown and their refusal to bring our flights luggage through a different one and the unpleasant and impersonal airline staff who treat anybody who is unfamiliar with the terminal like a sheep.",-1
2018-04-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I hate this airport,True,"  I hate this airport. The security line took longer than ever, I somehow set off the metal detector (I don't know how!) and the agents told me to stand on the side and I waited there for 15 minutes and no one ever told me what would happen next! Eventually an agent rubbed my hands with a cloth and told me to keep moving. I don't understand what that was all about. Next I went into the terminal 8 first class lounge and they wouldn't let me in because they told me it is for international flights only. Seriously? Most flights in that terminal at that time were domestic! I saw people holding boarding passes that said LAX-IAD on them being allowed inside the lounge! There is hardly any good seats in the gate areas. It is always way too loud and hectic in the terminals and the WiFi does not work at all. Finally, my flight was delayed by 10 minutes because the runway was so overcrowded that the aircraft took 20 minutes to get to the gate after landing. Then only good thing about this airport is that there are no TVs playing CNN like in every other US airport I've been to.",-1
2018-04-14,0.3,Family Leisure,1,1,3.0,2.0,,2.0,4.0,1.0,Staff are offish and ineffective,False," Despite the automated passport control machines, most people still have to queue for manual recheck and those that don’t still have to queue for the person to stamp the entry card. Staff are offish and ineffective. My 14 year old daughter was pulled for an immigration check and we nearly missed our connecting flight as we were sat in a waiting room for 2 hours. In that area, 2 people worked running the checks, one person sat on the front desk taking passports and handing them on, another “supervisor” sat and watched the TV and two more (maybe security) wandered around the waiting room occasionally in between sitting down watching TV and napping. One man was told by the lady at the desk to stand by the vending machine, a while later he was shouted at by another staff member for standing there and told to stand in the other corner. He said that’s where he was told to stand so she shouted “well now I’m telling you to stand over there ao you go stand over there” Even if it’s a connecting flight, LAX require all luggage to be picked up and then taken to another area for it to be checked in to the final destination. This makes LAX a poor choice for connecting flights. Toilets very dirty landside but better airside. The security screening is moderately rapid but there are no signs up to explain what should be done (shoes off, liquids in a bag etc) which means it’s mainly managed by staff yelling at the guests - usually with conflicting instructions. We got through OK but some less experienced travellers were left quite flustered. Overall, better than JFK and Newark but worse than any other US airport in my experience.",-1

",False,"  This airport and the employees here are the worst! We had a connecting flight that we were rushing to make & everyone here seemed to make it as difficult as possible for us along the way. The Southwest agent checking our bags wouldn't let us go ahead even though everyone in line said we could go first because our flight was leaving before theirs. Then comes the lazy, sluggish, rude, and inefficient people at the screening point. They have lines backed up and don't seem to have respect for anyone. When they pulled my backpack for an extra check, they left it sitting there and they slowly went through other people's stuff. When I told them my flight was leaving in 5 minutes, the guy shrugged and said, ""I guess you'll just have to wait"" then proceeded to talk to his colleagues and ignore me. I'm embarrassed this is in America, I'm dumbfounded that people are so blatantly rude, and I'm ashamed of their lack of compassion and common courtesy. Also - the airport is ugly, the layout makes no sense, and things run so poorly here. No wonder they're rude - their jobs must suck. Everything comes back around.",-1

The experience typically starts with huge traffic jams to reach the terminals and then you get to enjoy some of the worst public transportation facilities. To be fair this review is focused on T3 which is really bad both on the public and airside. There is nothing to enjoy in that terminal. It is old, there is nothing good about it.",-1

",True," The lines are ridiculously long and inefficient. Employees seem like they are all on their first day of the job. My pregnant wife was berated by a sassy airport employee during her pat-down, and was denigrated for bringing food for the flight. People selected for additional screening were waiting an average of 20 minutes after passing through security just to have someone pawing through their personal effects aimlessly. There was no privacy for the pat-down, which they required for us to bring our baby's food through security. Every time I route through LAX I spend at least 20 extra minutes on the tarmac, and every time I think the same thing: this is the worst airport I have ever flown through. Also, there is no skytrain between terminals, so if you need to transfer between terminals, you also have to pass through security again! Incredibly inefficient-like most of California.",-1

Have been to many airports in the world but nothing like this mess of a place that is called an international airport. People are treated like sheep because the place has been set up as such. The workers there have to be given a medal each to manage to work in such a place which has no vision of what an airport should resemble.

Although the staff on the ground/coalface/chalkface/in the trenches seemed to be doing their best to be friendly and efficient, the dynamics of the system they are trying to run are apalling! It feels like no-one has thought through how a prospective passenger can actually get through the hurdles of check in, security, passport control etc. People are therefore constantly in a state of confusion and anxiety.

You have to exit terminals and ride a bus to other terminals or to make your connection. The airport is dirty and the workers are rude and unfriendly. The restaurants are way too small, dirty and mediocre to awful food. Who designed these small restaurants with no seating? LAX website brags about their newly remodeled and trendy restaurants. What a joke! LAX needs to take some service and design lessons from Atlanta. What should we expect from a bunch of liberals? Exactly what you get.

2017-12-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,4,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,the worst experience I have ever had,True," This is the worst experience I have ever had while flying/connecting internationally. And that is after I didn't think my horrible experiences at John F. Kennedy International Airport could ever be surpassed. But they did. At first, I was very pleasantly surprised at the immigration lines. The wait was much less than expected, the terminal is new and beautiful, lots of staff to direct travelers. But then the nightmare started: I was already prepared that my luggage would not make it because of a severe delay in arrival when connecting in Frankfurt, Germany. Frankly, I was completely at ease with that, I didn't mind, it is not the first time this has happened, and I usually pack accordingly. However, for some reason there was a delay in delivering everyone's luggage that did make it, to baggage claim. No biggie, I thought, I had 2.5 hours to connect after clearing immigration! There were multiple announcements overhead where they apologized for the delay in delivering the bags, that there was more luggage waiting to be delivered, and to absolutely not leave without the luggage as it would not be transferred automatically. Meanwhile, 1.5hours later, Aeroflot luggage arrived at the same carousel, not one announcement that the remaining Lufthansa luggage would be taken off the carousel on one end of the thing, or that there would not be anything else coming. I started to get nervous because we were now entering the time frame where I might have trouble connecting to my last leg (approx 45 min to go before departure) and asked for the tenth time, what the plan was. Finally someone found out that there was no further luggage to be had, and to start heading for my connecting gate. Lines through customs were nearly a (felt) mile by now. Luckily I was able to use the much shorter Global Entry lines. Then came the shocker. Since I had no luggage to be rechecked, because it didn't make it, a customer service representative directed me to my connecting flight. ""Leave the terminal and hang a right to Terminal 7"" he said. I left, only to turn around because there were no good signs where terminal 7 even was. He did not offer any further instructions. I started running/walking to Terminal 7. During the 20min it took to get to Terminal 6 there was not one single bus that passed me. I ended up hopping on the bus to take me to the last terminal, because I was running out of steam. And I don't consider myself unfit! Now at Terminal 7, I had to go through security again. Mind you, with all that until now, if I had not been able to take advantage of TSA Precheck, I would not have made my connection because on top of that the gate was the second to last in this Terminal as well. I know of at least 4 more people that would have needed to get on the same plane that did not make it. Never will I do this to myself again.",-1

Come on - when someone empties the trash cans, please can someone come by and wipe down these desks! It is gross. No wonder people always get sick after they fly - they require cruise ships to have hand sanitizes posted around and they are always wiping down surfaces - what does LAX do to prevent the spread of diseases and protect travelers that come thru this airport?",-1
2017-11-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,3,5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,Where is the common sense,True," My departure from this airport was one of the worst I have every encountered. I have been stopped on many occasions when going through various security checks, mainly because I have jewellery which bleeps. I've never minded being questioned or having a general pat down, but the procedure I endured at LAX is absolutely beyond comprehension. I am a 72 year old woman, not that that makes any difference, but because of the bleep I was asked to wait in a separate area, and wait I did, for around 25 minutes, I only eventually got someone to do their job when I asked how much longer I would be kept waiting. The young woman advised me that I could go into a private room which I declined, thinking I was just having the ""normal"" pat down, how wrong could I be. It was humilating, legs apart this way, that way, her hands going down and around my waistband, whilst being watched by dozens of travellers. Where is the common sense, has it totally disappeared. I do realise you have a job to do, but this is ridiculous.",-1

Going through security was the most unpleasant part of our travel experience at Terminal 2. It felt like TSA implements their strictest security checks and most unfriendly customer service for families traveling with little kids and baby food. After clearing security, we proceeded directly to the boarding gate and didn't find any space for us to sit. In contrast, the security agents at London Heathrow were very polite and helpful, and there was ample seating. Overall, I can't recommend LAX T2 for families traveling with little kids.",-1
2017-11-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1,1,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,not customer friendly at all,False, Awful terminal configuration at Los Angeles LAX. Landing from one airline and having to transfer to another there is no shuttle. Have to go back thru security. Been flying to / from / thru LAX for 40 years. This trip is the last one. Going to fly thru Las Vegas from now on to final destination. And what genius decided that 5 bathroom stalls for an entire wing of the airport was a good idea? Major fail. LAX is a joke!

I thought my troubles were behind me now that I was returning home on a domestic flight, however I was sorely mistaken. I arrived for a 4.30 am flight at 2.30 am and was unable to check my bag until 3.30 am. The Southwest employees were late and rude. Without adding anything to my bag - their scales showed my checked bag was over by 3 pounds. After that issue was resolved I promptly went through security and off to my gate in terminal 1. About 15 minutes before my flight boarded at 4.15 am the same loud beeping from an inattentive airport employee who left a security gate open again continued until it was my turn to board my flight at 4.45. Now this issue seemed to be with Southwest - but overall all employees are inattentive to their own security rules. Why have travelers go through security when the airport employees disregard our safety, comfort, and clearly do not even value us as customers?",-1

They screened my belt, smart phone and shoes twice. “Because they missed it”. All restaurants in terminal 2 gate 22 area were full with virtually no seating and gate also was very limited.

I arrived at 7.30pm last Wednesday on an Air New Zealand flight into Tom Bradley terminal. After clearing the electronic passport readers quite quickly my happiness turned to despair as I was forced to queue through secondary immigration for a further 2 hours. The official asked why I was here and when I replied to stay with my daughter and son in law he asked if I liked my son in law. I was in no mood for banter and ignored his question. He repeated it until I answered. It is like a third world airport with no clocks seating or clearly marked toilet areas. I was so long in immigration that my suitcase had been dumped on the floor next to the carousel. The staff are rude and the experience is enough to put you off using this terminal again. Absolutely horrible.,-1

But, this time the lines for TSA were absolutely horrendous. The worst I have ever experienced. It was a 40 minute wait just to get to the screening area. This is unacceptable. This is mickey mouse. This is not making America great again. They could do a lot better. There were a lot of screening lanes closed. This is simply a lack of budget. This is very poor. Bad management. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Otherwise, the international section of this airport is pretty good. Once you get past the security.",-1

There are no clocks for travellers to know the time, insufficient number of seats, no seats and tables in the smoking area, no information desk, over-priced duty-free shops (all items are cheaper outside and no cellphone service.

The terminal was beautifully decorated for Cinco de Mayo festival. There were plenty of self-serve kiosks and the check-in area was not congested. The TSA security line was also short.

I wandered around one of the terminals trying to figure out how to get to my connection in another terminal without leaving. I finally asked security staff at the exit and he was rude and really not interested in helping out. He told me ""I don't know, you're on your way out right?"". When I said that I was trying to connect to another airline, he basically didn't really want to help me but he eventually asked which airline, and he then said ""I don't know"". I got frustrated and told him that I'd ask someone else for the way to the international connections. Nobody there to help at all. Finally fluked out and asked a service counter for help and they pointed me through Gate 22 downstairs and into a lineup for a shuttle. No clear signs, nothing. I then made it to Terminal B, I must've walked around for 30 minutes before I could figure out what's happening because the departures board doesn't say anything beyond a couple hours at a time (my flight is leaving in 3 hours from now). I finally gave up and went to the lounge for my airline and saw a screen listing the gate. About the only thing decent was the overpriced sushi lunch and oh, yeh, I get free internet. I'm not looking forward to my return in a week's time. I guess in this case a 6 hour layover worked out for me - brutal.",-1

We kept looking at the boards and no flight information was provided. The boards were not regularly updated either. We checked the departure information on their website but this did not show our flight. We asked at least 4 different people who all reassured us that we were in the correct terminal. As the time for our flight drew closer we became more and more anxious. We were advised that there was no information desk. We went to the British Airways desk and they made a call and told us that we were in the wrong terminal and needed to be in terminal 6 (the terminal that we had come into in the first place.

Immigration and customs procedures took approx 1h 55 min! All lugages of French passengers were systematically controlled by customs. It's too long. We ran from customs to the aircraft to embark just before the doors closed.

Information desk was antiquated with no computer screens in sight, and an equally antiquated staff member bought out some dusty old book with which she retrieved a whole lot of useless information and pointed me in the wrong direction. There was no useful signage for departure / check in, no information on baggage collection apart from one screen with very small writing that was displayed sideways (impossible to read).

There was a delay to my departure and rather than return to the lounge went to have a look around. Plenty of seating, refreshment areas and stores to stock up on. TBIT is one of the two best terminals I visit (other being Terminal D at DFW). JFK can take a lesson or two from LAX and DFW.",1
2017-07-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,3,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,Poor old LAX,False,"  Poor old LAX: the heaving, antiquated, white elephant of US arrival points from the Pacific region. If you repeat to yourself for weeks in advance, ""It's going to take three hours to get out of there"" then, like me, you'll be fair chuffed with 1 hour and 45 minutes (50 minutes to reach the machines that you stick your passport and your fingers into, then another 55 to reach the immigration officer to show him your passport and stick your fingers into his little machine). On the bright side, your baggage has gone around 350 times before being removed by someone and placed at the side of the carousel, so no waiting there (unless someone else has walked off with it). There seems to be some kind of hierarchy, whereby the grumpiest, shoutiest staff welcome you from your plane and scream at you that you're an idiot for not queueing properly (maybe owing to the lack of signage?), the would-rather-be-somewhere-else-but-can-affect-caring-if-I-really-try staff help out at the electronic machines, while the immigration officer at the final desk is pleasant and friendly. Maybe it's a kind of Hunger Games / Battle Royale deal: survive each stage and you get to pass into the U.S. The arrivals terminal (Tom Bradley) is cramped and full, but because it's small it's easy to escape. Not sure I'd fancy transferring from it, though. Not without four hours up my sleeve. It's better than it was ten years ago though, and once you get out into LA's sunshine you can quickly forget it. Tip: arrive here directly from Shanghai Pudong, and you'll at least feel more like a human being than you would if you arrived here from Auckland, Changi, Narita, Hong Kong, Melbourne and Heathrow.",-1

You climb off your plane after 10 hours from auckland, spend two hours progressing through an unnecessary security process, only to end up back at your plane again ready for another 11 hours to London. We had already been through a very thorough, professional security check in New Zealand. The queues were long and slow. Everyone was annoyed. The fingerprint scan was the final straw. How were they able to get this passed through law? I had not broken any US law, and yet they forced me to provide finger prints, which I am sure they were able to keep on record after I moved on. Where are my rights? Once we made it into the airport terminal we had 20 minutes to buy some food - 15 of which I spent in a queue watching one woman serve a line of 20 people while her manager stood watching. So we made it to the plane hungry, annoyed and sore from walking around. There is no money in the world that would convince me to pass through this airport again.",-1

Every time I come through here I never think it can be worst yet they continue to surprise me by continuing to underperform my already minimal expectations. Today I came from HND to LAX - the customs line was insanely long and only 1 agent was working. People have connections to make and taking an hour to just get through that line is irresponsible and unacceptable. Following that, every other airport in the world I have passed through has a separate security line for just connection passengers, not at LAX - they actually make you leave the airport and go back through the general security line which today looked to be another hour long wait. If I didn't have Global Entry and TSA Pre-check I would of missed my connection. It is a pathetic excuse of an airport, the staff are not friendly and I will do my best to make all connections go through other US location just to avoid LAX.",-1

As a frequent flyer out of LAX I appreciate this terminal for not being completely hectic. For those of you who have flown out of Terminal 1 or Terminal B you know how crazy those one can be. T2 is pretty good at keeping a chilled vibe, most of the time. Early morning flights will push you to wait for security outside, lines are long, get TSA pre check! Most people are bi-lingual (English + Spanish). T2 is average but definitely better than some of the other ones, traffic in and out is a problem. Be at the terminal at least 2 hours to give you time to get checked in and go through security!",1

They need more customs and border control staff and improved signage. There are 45 booths and on the day I arrived, only 12 were open to process more than 2,000 arrivals. Surely they can plan ahead and add more customs and border control staff. Waiting in an increasingly longer line for 2 hours every time we arrive at this airport is a terrible experience when all that is needed is more staff. There are very few signs directing people where to go, but far too many staff yelling at people. I avoid this airport as much as possible.",-1

It would make more sense to drive to Orange County, Ontario or Burbank rather than land at this place, it would literally saved 6 hours. I could have been to Beijing by now.

2016-05-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,1,5,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,line for security was so long,False,"  I have traveled throughout the world, through many airports, so in saying that, I want this feedback to be as objective as possible. On April 27th I flew home to Australia from LAX. The line for security was so long, I had to queue through watching many people frustrated as they were held up for flights that were about to board or were boarding. May I make one very useful recommendation? Have a priority queue at security, for all the passengers whose flights are currently boarding. Other airports around the world do this, and have airport staff pointing those quests that are on a flight that is currently boarding, to the priority queue. It works well and efficiently and will eliminate the sudden rush of passengers who are trying to get through the long security line to their flights – which in turn will reduce the amount of delayed flights that are moving out of your airport. As mentioned, this method works in other airports around the world, and I believe can be successfully administered at LAX. Other passengers who have ample time for the security queue will not mind those passengers who are about to miss a flight, to move to a priority queue which is solely for guests who are on a flight that is currently boarding. I understand the budget cuts have affected the airport but this is a simple method that does not require extra staff but is better management of the current staff allocations. I, along with many other quests, were very disappointed at the nonchalant nature of the staff at LAX who showed no sense of urgency, empathy or even concern for those passengers whose flights were about to leave.",-1
