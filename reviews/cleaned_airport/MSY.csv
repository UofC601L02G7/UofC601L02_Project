2024-08-10,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,I am grateful for being helped,False,"  My experience with United Airlines at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport was ramping up towards a masterclass of poor professional service and lack of customer empathy. When a delay came up for my initial flight, I spoke to a remote agent who ultimately said, ""tough luck"" and didn't provide any options. There was no empathy and no discussion of any options to make it home safely. You can imagine I was scared and anxious when my flight to return home was nowhere in sight. Luckily, at United's desk, the representative Anna, who also worked at United, was present. She is the epitome of the perfect professional. She used critical listening to understand my concern and problem-solved on the spot. She gave me an option to return home safely. This wasn't a testament to United training, because it seems like the rep prior routinely told me ""tough luck,"" but it showed how much of a true professional AND good person Anna is. I am grateful for being helped by Anna at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport, who works at United Airlines. If any problem arises, and she is present, best believe she will give you the most ultimate and efficient service.",1
2024-04-26,0.7,Business,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,one of the nicest and biggest airports,True,"  It was first time at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport; it was is one of the nicest and biggest airports I have come through in the USA. anywhere in the world. This multi level airport has many boarding bridges. There are many shops and restaurants. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The airport is well-decorated and well-maintained and easy to get in or out. Public areas are a huge, clean and bright.",1
2023-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,nothing whatsoever to recommend,False," I've traveled all over the world and probably been to close to 100 different airports. I can confidently say that in terms of international airports this place is probably the worst. There is nothing whatsoever to recommend it. The location is bad. It's been under construction for more than a decade, resulting in the removal of the limited seating and amenities they formerly had in the outer areas where you wait and pick people up. Staff are uniformly rude, uninformed and/or just plain incompetent. It's badly organized and unattractive. There's very little to nothing in the way of assistance for things like ground transport, rental cars and the like. And they don't have that many flights. So the only reason to use this airport is if you absolutely have to go to New Orleans. If you're flying out, including overseas, use Gulfport or somewhere else and avoid this dump.",-1
2023-05-12,0.9,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"no problems with queueing anywhere"" ",False,"  Was departing New Orleans two days after jazzfest. Had no problems with queueing anywhere. Had some time to kill before my flight and sat outside in a cool spot close to where buses depart. Spent some time chatting to n airport employee. Absolutely delightful, polite young man.",1
2023-02-15,0.1,Business,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,rude and completely unwilling to help,True," Disgusted by the employees and customer service here. Traveled with someone who left their purse (with identification and the whole nine in it) in a bathroom and we were sent on a wild goose chase to find someone who was even willing to help us retrieve it. We were met with horrible attitudes and treated like a bother by everyone we encountered and were even told by multiple employees “I can’t help you with that”, and after being sent to them by another employee at that! If it weren’t for the law enforcement office we would not have received any help at all. Not being able to help is one thing, but being rude and completely unwilling to help is another. Do better.",-1
2023-01-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,poorly thought out billion dollar fiasco,False," Nearly everything is wrong with this airport. But special disdain goes to the rental car location (30 minutes away!) and that the shuttles drop you off at baggage claim for departure. Then there is a long brisk walk and 2 escalators to get to check in where there is a line all the way to the door. We slipped outside and did curbside check in. (The only nice person in the airport was at the curbside check in for Southwest). TSA is very nasty here too, and not empathetic at all. There seems to be tons of wasted space and open areas and very little space that is actually useful. The MSY airport had been remodelled after Hurricane Katrina and it was quite nice back them. Why ruin it for this poorly thought out billion dollar fiasco? It has a very generic look. There is barely any seating except at the terminal. The restaurants and shops are like mall kiosks. For a brand new airport there are few modern conveniences. I feel huge sympathy for anyone elderly or with a disability, this airport is not for you! Really its not for anyone",-1
2022-10-21,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,one hour+ is an average wait time,False,"  This is the worst airport experience I had since I have been traveling. All passengers have to go through big lines, it’s only one way to get to all gate access, one hour+ is an average wait time just to get by the security check and another 30 to 40 minutes for the security check. Most ridiculous set up I have ever seen. I hope I would never have to come back here again. I still at the line writing review … it’s been an hour, I hope I won’t miss my flight. One more thing to add, if you are retiring a rental car that you picked up from another location good luck with that, add some extra time, you will not know where to drop, you be be lost, your phone GPS can be your best option.",-1
2022-05-19,0.1,Family Leisure,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,Words just cannot describe how poor this airport design is,True," Wish I had taken pictures. Words just cannot describe how poor this airport design is. It is almost like a real life experiment on the way an airport could be designed to make customers walk the most, be disorganized, crowded in little walkways that go to plain ugly open spaces, have to be jammed up tightly to retrieve luggage, have a terrible time finding a restroom. Customers with bladder issues need diapers because there will not be a conveniently located restroom. Perhaps they should include a vending machine for them. It is really scary that it isn't an experiment but a new facility, opened November 2019 at a cost of 1.3 billion dollars. If I could rate a negative number I would.",-1
2022-05-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This airport is a total chaotic mess,False,  The wait for the rental car bus is unbearably long. No organization. This airport is a total chaotic mess. The rental car situation adds at least an hour on to your trip whether you are arriving or departing. They need to get their act together.,-1
2022-04-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Totally ridiculous,True," My 15 yo daughter and I were made to feel as though we were being prepared for a maximum security federal prison sentence. This is not the first time NOLA TSA has made us feel this way but I can say with certainty it will be the last, we will never fly from this airport again. They were rude (as usual), cold, uncaring and borderline verbally abusive. You feel like you are in a foreign country with laws you may not understand that could cause you to be arrested. My daughter had fresh torn ligaments and had an orthopedic boot in place. She was barely able to walk on it but managed so we didn’t have the extra burden of crutches. When we approached the first TSA “Agent”, and I use that term loosely, he was so inhuman, unkind and snapped at me about where to place my phone to have my boarding pass scanned. The TSA agent repeating the same unclear instructions again does not explain to me how to do something. Then we had to prepare to be x-rayed, we placed our items in the bins (do that right or you will get yelled at- speaking from previous experience), my daughter was told to take off her shoe but she could leave the boot. She did as told. Entering x-ray, the other very young, poorly trained, rude TSA agent instructed her to remove the ortho boot. I explained she can not do that, she can not stand without the boot. She made her do it anyway, they sent it thought the conveyer x-ray. She stood there approx 3 min, alone, with no support (they would not allow me in to assist her and they would rather die than show some compassion and offer a chair or a helping hand) her right leg was trembling, her affected ankle was in pain from removing the orthopedic boot, I was left to feel helpless. Finally wen the boot scan was complete, I was able to assist with putting it back on. It was extremely painful. In my profession, we are required to go through sensitivity training to make sure our customers always feels safe and to understand how to treat people with respect and kindness. NOLA TSA needs sensitivity training and they to be held accountable for their terrible treatment to passengers! They act as though they are the highest authority in the land and they are untouchable. Totally ridiculous. We rarely travel and to have them start my vacation like that was just unnecessary. If the government officials cared anything about that city, they would prevent their citizens and visitors from being treating like this.",-1
2021-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,The Rudest Airport in the USA,True," The winner for The Rudest Airport in the USA goes to New Orleans! From the security check point to the drink preparer at Starbucks - they all share a bad attitude. Must be in the employee handbook - be rude to all, no need to show grace or patience, just be rude!",-1
2021-06-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no urgency at all or care for the customers and flight times,False,"  This was by far the worst experience I have ever had in all my years of traveling. My boyfriend and I came to New Orleans for our anniversary. We enjoyed our trip until we arrived at the New Orleans airport to depart. We arrived 1 hour and 45 mins before our flight was scheduled to leave. We checked in out bags in 15 mins and headed to the TSA check in area. We waited 1 hour and 20 mins in line just to get through airport security. We finally made it to the lady to get our id and boarding pass checked 20 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (5 mins before boarding was over). The worst part was we still had to place our items on the scanner and be scanned through as well. By the time we finished it was 12 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (3 mins after boarding was over). We ran and made it at 5.50 am for our 6.00 am flight. The gate was closed. Although the plane was there they were not allowing anyone else to board the plane. We missed our flight. And could not get another flight for the rest of the day. This airport is low staff, low resources, no urgency at all or care for the customers and flight times. It’s unorganized and ruined the entire experience of New Orleans. We were not accommodated nor were arrangements made for us. This is very poor customer service and we will not be returning again.",-1
2021-06-03,0.4,Family Leisure,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,Why is there no recycling available,False,"  Why is there no recycling available in the New Orleans airport? In a city that consumes more than most, we must step it up and provide throughout the airport! We need to act like an environmental friendly, progressive city to move forward! We need a glass recycling company above all in Nola! Please act responsible and get it done!",-1
2020-04-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,I miss the old terminal so much,True," New terminal is the worst case of the ""emperor has no clothes"" ever. Uncomfortable. Poor design. Passengers huddle behind the few available walls to shield themselves from the blinding sunlight flowing in unfiltered through voluminous windows. There is no place to hide. Inadequate seating. I miss the old terminal so much. What a waste of money! And the news media seems to be complicit in this boondoggle. This is not a Mercedes with four flat tyres, this is a Pinto with no tires that has been stripped for parts no one wants.",-1
2020-03-04,0.4,Business,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,4.0,did you recycle the toilet seats,False," I travel a lot and all over the world. I was happy that New Orleans upgraded to a newer facility. However, did you recycle the toilet seats from the old airport? The disgusting plastic that you have to click the green button? Well, the one in my stall was jammed! I have to say that I am embarrassed that an airport as new as this one is not as clean as most airports I fly in & out of. I'm proud of my city and wish that it would take care of itself.",1
2020-02-23,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,they failed to transfer our luggage,False,"  New Orleans airport (MSY) seems completely average compared to other airports, except for one thing: they failed to transfer our luggage as we changed flights to Kansas City. This was a huge problem since I had checked on a laptop and a lot of our children's clothing from a lengthy stay in Florida. They had to send my luggage through a different flight and I wasted a lot of time returning to pick up the luggage at a later date.",-1
2020-02-22,0.2,Business,4.0,1.0,,4.0,4.0,,,,this airport's cleanliness is below standards,False,"  Please have your cleaning staff clean on a more regular basis. The bathroom toilet fixture was broken, dusty and the trash bin was full with a dirty bandaid on top. The floors were dirty. It was very apparent they had not really cleaned the floors. For a new airport, I was disappointed on the conditions of the airport cleanliness. The white columns are dirty around the floor base as well and the hook on the door to the bathroom was broken. As someone who was excited about the new airport, lack of care was disappointing. In comparison to ATL, DFW, JAX, DEN, PDX, FLL, TOA, MCO, this airport's cleanliness is below standards.",1
2020-02-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,,4.0,the TSA set up was a giant fail,False,"  Poor design in passenger drop off and pick up areas. Absolutely a mess and people were so frustrated that no one could move that it became dangerous. The ticketing area was fine but the TSA set up was a giant fail as well. The agents could check people faster than the lines could clear through the scanners so the agents sat idle much of the time and the entire line just was in a dead lock. Once inside I noticed there were only a few restrooms (2 per terminal), all with very long lines (on a Tuesday mid-morning). Gate seating areas were ridiculously undersized for number of passengers on a plane. There was seating for about 50 with the gates directly next to us both filled with their own passengers so people just sat on the floor in the walkways. Not safe! If they intended for overflow to go into next gate they have to plan for that in staggering schedules. Overall I really don't understand why they built this. It is undersized for current needs with no room for growth in the industry. The trend is more people traveling and they seem to be expecting the opposite. Pretty much frustrated with poor scaling the entire morning. We are told to get there with much time to spare (by TSA) but there is no where to go. I will avoid this airport whenever possible. Yes it was pretty.",-1
2020-01-24,0.1,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,it is filthy,False,"  The new airport in New Orleans is a beautiful structure - the architect Cesar Pelli did a wonderful job. Everything else was designed by hacks and engineers no doubt selected for their political patronage - because they obviously have no design talent. The garages and drives and signage are not any better than third world airports. Think Orlando, Chicago and Miami airport landscaping and signage - all beautifully designed and maintained- not New Orleans - no design talent anywhere outside of the terminal - a waste of a billion dollars! The biggest problem with this 10 week old terminal is that it is filthy - I have been through the airport 4 times since it opened in November and I can attest that the floors have not ben cleaned once since opening. The same stains and dirt piles are on the floors. They have been swept clean by the lazy airport staff, but never washed clean. What a shame after the efforts put into the design and great layout. Atlanta and Detroit airports are all run by similar politically connected vendors- but they are spotlessly clean and beautiful. The New Orleans folks just don’t care about being clean - what a shame. Maybe the mayor is a slob and doesn’t know what clean is - because if she ever traveled anywhere else - she would understand that you need to clean floors every door when millions walk in them. Slobs - all slobs. Wake up New Orleans and clean this building!",-1
2020-01-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,new airport is a real mess,True," This new airport is a real mess. Baggage takes 45 minutes to come out, then on wrong belt. No signs in airport to direct you to where food might be if you don't want an expensive sit down restaurant. People in and out of airport are rude. Taxi cab people were screaming at tourists yesterday, 1/14/20. Lines are long for taxi. Uber and Lyft had at least 100 people in it. Only one lane for taxi and arrivals to depart. When my ride picked us up it took 24 minutes to get out of airport area and headed to interstate. The one lone security officer directing the gridlock blew his whistle constantly at people trying to pick up their passengers. There were several people arguing in rideshare line because of long lines and no line organization. I flew on southwest 561 from LGA.",-1
2020-01-11,0.1,Business,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,Doubt if I'll ever come to New Orleans again,False,"  This is the worst airport design and customer service I have ever experienced. Take the rental car signs off the airport parking direction signs! I drove around the airport parking lot 3 times following the rental car signs before I finally saw an employee sitting off in the cut and asked how to get to the rental car lot. She got annoyed when I didn’t understand her lackluster directions (take a right at the light and then another right?) and said “I don’t know” and turned away from me. Finally found a >10in. sign with no lighting by it that said rental car return. Horrible. Doubt if I'll ever come to New Orleans again and if I have to, I’ll drive.",-1
2020-01-11,0.1,Business,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,Its getting worse not better,True, Bags take forever to come out. When I got to baggage claim my bags didn't come out for 40 minutes. This is absolutely ridiculous! Its getting worse not better!,-1
2020-01-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,This place needs to be reviewed,False,"  Not only did they lose my bag when I flew out and not properly screen passengers, but now flights arriving back at MSY are getting their bags before my flight. I mean 15 minutes later than ours. This is not my first time having this problem, last time they had four flight arrivals on one baggage claim. This airport is hot garbage. This place needs to be reviewed by some federal aviation commission.",-1
2019-12-21,0.2,Business,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,new airport is a nightmare,False,"  The new airport in New Orleans is a nightmare! The traffic in and out of the airport is horrible. During rush hour add an extra hour or two to your trip. There is only one way in and one way out and it’s bumper to bumper. Also, long lines to go through security. No seats at baggage claim. Loud live music playing in the background while passengers are calling family members to tell them they have arrived. The old airport was a dream, new airport is a nightmare!",-1
2019-12-20,0.1,Business,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,Worst engineering design for a modern airport,False,"  Who builds a new, modern airport and fails to include computer stations and general sitting areas to eat? New Orleans is who. Worst engineering design for a modern airport. Very poor food selection in concourses. Most food places are kiosks where you must take your food with you. But wait, they don't have any table seating for a person to eat their food.",-1
2019-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Rudest people I have ever seen,False,"  Worst airport security screening. People on duty behave like they are there to pass the time and do not care how they are impacting people queued up. When I arrived in the queue, there were about 7 people ahead of me. It took me 45-60 minutes to get through that. Rudest people I have ever seen. I talked to few people to understand if this is one odd day or it is like this everytime. I was told that it is worst at night because there is no supervisor at night time.",-1
2019-12-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,a waste of $1.3 billion,False," What a waste of $1.3 billion. This new airport is literally the worst I've been in a long time, and I travel all the time throughout the year! The signs are a complete joke, and they're incorrectly placed/marked from the time you begin pulling into the driveway! Literally terminal and parking signs, departure and arrival signs, and even the arrows on the signs for the exits are incorrectly marked and/or posted directionally! The old MSY was laid out much more efficiently and effectively than the new one! We were disappointed the time we arrived and then again 5 days later when we departed as well! We should've known with this state and city what to expect, and it was no surprise the lack of concern the staff showed either! Thank God for the kiosks at the ticket counters because hopefully these will replace some of the atrocious, rude, lazy staff that you currently have in place! That'll be a huge improvement for you guys, so I can't wait for this continued transition! We also waited 40 minutes from the time we deplaned for our luggage! I've had bags miss flights I was on make it on the plane behind us arrive more quickly than this! Terrible customer service! Your employees legitimately don't seem to care. Overall, I'd honestly give this airport experience a D-. We will be flying from BTR going forward! At least they're courteous and seem to care more than MSY! Plus, the signs are correct and the airport is obviously easier to navigate than whatever you guys call that setup/system at MSY!",-1
2019-12-01,0.6,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,Love the new airport layout,False, Love the new airport layout and the natural light in the C gate area bathrooms. The space is significantly more inviting and relaxing. The speediness and helpfulness of the staff could be improved.,1
2019-11-21,0.3,Business,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,such a mediocre standard,False," Somewhat astonishing that a brand new airport would be build to such a mediocre standard. Signage, security, and staff were unhelpful and didn’t seem to want to be at work. The security design is particularly poor. It is not like you need to invent this. There are many best in class examples around the world. Was not terribly busy when I passed through but this airport won’t cope with heavy volume.",-1
2019-11-14,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,Security are rude and uncaring,False,"  This is the new airport and it is woeful. Security are rude and uncaring if items are separated from passengers. Laptop spills onto rollers because they push the buckets through with total disregard for value. Worst security experience ever for me. I think they needed more space, tables. This is new? What will holiday travel be like? The food stalls are not well stocked. Not enough staff to help customers. Lines are too long for the low volume of travelers. Signage is not well considered.",-1
2019-11-08,0.5,Business,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,,,a brand new airport was built so small,True," 
Finally the new airport opens, nearly a year late. It is unfortunate a brand new airport was built so small. Holdrooms are no where near big enough and the bag system was undersized from the beginning. Is it too late to tear it down and start over?",1
2019-11-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,apology for an international airport,True," My son and I used New Orleans airport on 12th October 2019 as the departure point on our return to the UK. Given the importance of New Orleans we were shocked by how poor the whole airport experience was: Extremely poor signage, Dirty floors, the carpeted areas were particularly filthy. Toilets were disgraceful, loose fixings, unpleasant smells, inadequate drying facilities. Food outlets were shameful, unreasonably expensive, restricted choices, staff had a totally 'couldn't care less' attitude. The whole airport had an atmosphere of neglect, scruffiness and disregard of travellers. Having greatly enjoyed the experience of the city it was a crying shame for that experience to be soured by this abysmal apology for an international airport.",-1
2019-10-26,0.2,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,most outdated airport,True," By far the dirtiest, most outdated airport I have ever been too. I have travelled a great deal and never have I encountered such disgusting toilet facilities. No locks on the doors, taps not working, no paper towel. The staff at the airport are more interested in talking about their social life very loudly than serving Customers. The whole experience has left me never wanting to go back to New Orleans again, which is very unfortunate because we had such a great time and the staff at our hotel were amazing.",-1
2019-10-15,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,48 minutes to get luggage,False,"  Not much to look forward to at this airport but I still have to use it when the family and/or friends decide to air travel. Departure, waiting in line, is the usual waste of life. The thing that turns me sideways is the baggage handling on arrivals, it is almost as if they do it on purpose, seems the handlers get together and discuss just how they can annoy the passengers. I traveled with three other couples on a trip here and there. This trip back from the national parks in Utah was the worst yet when it came to getting our baggage. Walked off the plane at 9.52 pm and 48 minutes later the planes luggage started in on the wrong belt, it came in on a different one that was labeled for the flight. 48 minutes to get luggage from the plane to the belt. The flight took 160 minutes to move one thousand five hundred and ten miles, it took the baggage handlers 48 minutes to move luggage just hundreds of feet. I do not understand what can be the problem, other than incompetence and lack of concern by the airport/airlines. Oh! If you do not pay attention to what the bottom of you luggage looks like, I would recommend that you learn what it looks like from the bottom, because each and every time your luggage comes down the moving belt it will be upside down. Do you take time to consider how you pack your bag, you know, the stuff you don't mind getting mashed you put on the bottom, well your bag will travel upside down anyway so it doesn't matter how you pack it. The baggage handlers suck at what they do. I hold the airport and the airline responsible. Southwest needs to straighten up. In this review, I have given the individual review categories all one star, having to wait on your luggage for way to long of a period takes away from the experience as a whole.",-1
2019-10-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,unpleasant personnel for the most part,True," Let's just cut to the chase: New Orleans as a metropolis is, if nothing else, consistent. Consistently poorly operated, poorly signed, filthy, mismanaged, disorganized, and unkempt. These values are reflected quite adequately in the airport. Add to that long lines even for TSA Pre-Check (TSA seem to want to take their precious times), unpleasant personnel for the most part, and the feeling the airport hasn't been renovated or even cleaned since circa 1986, and, well, I think you can envision this airport if you've never been there. Get it together, New Orleans and Louisiana by first ""un-corrupting"" your governments. On the bright side, with the exception of St. Tammany Parish way off in the North Shore, the airport is probably the safest part of the metropolis.",-1
2019-10-08,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Really disappointed with this airport,True," Really disappointed with this airport (concourse C). Considering it’s such a destination location you would have thought they would have put more work into the comfort and care of passengers. The seats are uncomfortable, the food court has patio furniture, no water stations for water bottles (the water fountain tastes horrible), bathrooms were dirty, and everything just felt old and dirty.",-1
2019-06-18,0.6,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,New Orleans Airport customer review,True," I was TSA pre check with wheelchair assistance. I have metal in my body which I told the TSA, once I was cleared they went through the full body detector, the airport's wheelchair went thru and beeped. Instead of checking the wheelchair, which they claimed they did but I didn't see it, I was patted down. Really! I asked if this is the way they treat pre check, she looked surprised and said, you're pre check? Then she said the wheelchair beeped which belongs to the Airport, I have to pat you down. Help me to understand this concept.",-1
2019-06-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Unbelievably terrible experience,False,"  Unbelievably terrible experience. Completely disorganized, TSA was unnecessarily rude and everything in total disarray. The building is grotesquely outdated and nothing runs properly. Missed my flight because of the total incompetence of the airport, and specific airline (American Airlines) utter failure to warn customers of the condition, i.e. slow security check, despite acknowledging they were familiar with the situation. Arrived over an hour and a half early for a flight I missed due to the total incompetence of the airport and airline staff. New Orleans needs to get it together.",-1
2019-05-15,0.3,Business,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,Everything is dated,False," The worse airport ever! The staff at the restaurants are rude and disrespectful, and they seem unorganized. Not only is there not a sufficient number of restrooms, but the restrooms that are available are nasty and dirty and smell like urine. Everything is dated and the airport smells lie mildew. This airport is in dire need of renovations.",-1
2019-04-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,TSA are absolutely rude!,False,"  TSA are absolutely rude! Checking in at 9:30am I opted out of going through the body scanner and they left me standing without my luggage or my travel documents for 20 mins! When I asked one of the TSA agents how much longer the wait would be when I observed them putting someone ahead of me, she told me “not on your time”. With her multi coloured hair and unprofessional attitude. I don’t know how some of these unprofessional people were hired at an airport to be amongst mass population. I asked for the supervisor and can you believe as I’m leaving the same girl called me stupid! This kind doesn’t deserve to be employed and definitely not as a lead TSA agent.",-1
2019-01-12,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,in complete shock at our experience,False,  I never take the time to write a review but our experience in MSY was the worst I have ever encountered. We are seasonal travelers and fly in and out if many airports frequently each year. The TSA agent was a large lady that yelled at the people in the line then came up behind me and my husband and small children and screamed directly in my ear to move faster. My kids were terrified and were moving so fast as it was that they were frantically picking up their suitcase to put on the belt for screening. My youngest went through in tears she was so terrified. When I told the agent that we were moving quickly to be patient with us she threatened to hold me in a cell and not let me Board an airplane for talking back to her. I was in complete shock at our experience. I have never been treated so poorly in all our hundreds of travels across the world. We will never fly through this airport again. Our experience was the worst! And continued on to the other agents working there. Customer service must not be taught here.,-1
2018-11-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,A chaotic experience,False,"  A chaotic experience from check in to boarding. Check in desks poorly signed manned by rude and unhelpful staff. As a regular world traveller the check in process was the slowest I have ever experienced. Security was further struggle. No attention paid to orderly lines, and manned by by shouting bullying staff. The experience deteriorated further airside. Limited outlets for food and drink, with long lines to purchase. Tannoy announcements were barely audible. All in all, a very poor experience, and definitely an airport to avoid.",-1
2018-07-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"old, run down and disorganized",False,"  The airport is old, run down and disorganized. For lack of better terms, MSY airport is a disgrace. Parking is a nightmare, the airline staff we have personally dealt with have not been friendly or very helpful and TSA is incredibly rude at this particular airport. I would advise eating anywhere else as the food choices are both minimal and not well made. I am very much looking forward to the renovations being done for this airport as it desperately needs it!",-1
2018-04-11,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,leaves such a bad impression,True,"  This airport leaves such a bad impression of New Orleans. The staff at the restaurants are slow or rude. My friend waited forever at subway. I saw a bunch of people waiting in line at a cheesecake place, and the worker was sitting down at a table on her phone (it’s 7:00 am, and opening wasn’t long ago). The bathrooms in the D concourse smell like cigarette smoke. The carpets are filthy. For security, each concourse is separate. So you have to go through twice to go to B and wait, and then to D. It’s really inconvenient, even with pre-check. I’ve never felt disgusted at an airport in the United States ... until now. I hope they finish the new terminal soon, so people aren’t left (or greeted) with the absolute worst impression of this great city.",-1

Please do something about this. I am from here and travel at least once/month. Slowest for luggage to come out. In the time I'm waiting for my luggage, I've written this review.",-1
