2024-03-13,0.4,Family Leisure,5,5,5.0,5,5,4.0,3.0,1,“security systems are poor”,False," Overall, good level of cleanliness and amenities. However, security systems are poor. Despite not being busy in the least, security lines were bottlenecked, disabled passengers neglected, staff frazzled and harried, all passengers treated with the minimum of civility. Most airports are significantly busier and flow more smoothly. A top to bottom review of systems may help pinpoint why such a small number of passengers can cause the entire process to break down, continously.",-1
2024-03-02,1.0,Solo Leisure,5,5,,5,0,,,5,provided phenomenal customer service,False,"  Ms Terri V, who was the boarding agent for my flight provided phenomenal customer service when it was needed most. When I realized that my lay over time from my connecting flight to my final destination was tight, she was able to move me up four rows with no extra charge. She was friendly, patient and wanted to do what was right for the customer given my situation, when many others may have not cared as much. She is someone other boarding and TSA agents should emulate not just here in San Antonio, but around other airports as well.",1
2023-03-28,0.2,Business,3,1,2.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,2,making such a poor first impression,True,"  Returned from a business trip. Went thru four airports with my wife. In San Antonio the women's bathroom in terminal B was the worst seen and the Valero Open is coming and no one at the airport cares. First stall had a bag over the toilet Second stall had a note on door does not work When my wife found one that works, there was no toilet paper, but there was plenty oall over the floor. There were four sinks, and two had bags over the faucets - not working. This is how we look to visitors! Really a poor image. This is my city, but this is not who I am. We are making such a poor first impression on new visitors I give us one star.",-1
2022-09-20,0.6,Solo Leisure,5,4,1.0,4,3,2.0,5.0,4,SAT is an overall good option,True,"  I prefer using this airport over almost any other in Texas' major cities, but, in true American airport form, there are advantages and drawbacks to using San Antonio (SAT). Here are the pros: Access from either I-410 or US 281 is pretty easy, considering that interchange is one of the busiest in the city. Access to the very busy, touristic downtown is relatively easy, as the airport isn't far away by rideshare. Parking is easy, access from the parking garages to the terminal is easy, signage leading to and within the airport is pretty easy to follow. Delta check-in was quick and friendly. Gate agents were professional and helpful. Staff in the stores generally seemed friendly. The terminal is mostly clean; the pre-security check-in area is very spacious and modern. Using CLEAR and Pre-Check, I breezed through security. However, here are the drawbacks: Security (TSA) had an officious, dour attitude that I'd expect much more in Houston, Miami, LAX, or NYC - not San Antonio. Don't know what that was about. The restrooms were filthy. Seating throughout the terminal was not at all ample for the crowds of people waiting to fly out; the airport desperately needs expansion, and that includes more seating and general modernization post-security. Upon return, baggage claim was remarkably slow for a small airport (albeit a small airport serving a large metropolitan area). So, pound for pound, SAT is an overall good option, and I'd still rather use them than anything in Houston or Austin, but there is still room for improvement.",1
