2023-10-28,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,Alejandro is hands down the best,False,"  While I found the Jacksonville airport to be very clean with exceptionally friendly, professional employees, my review is regarding one in particular. His name is Alejandro, a wheelchair provider for people departing and arriving at the airport. I first met him on October 17, 2023 when I arrived at JAX. He was prompt, friendly, and a very nice person. Well, when I left JAX I ran into Alejandro again and he recognized me (after a week and all the people he'd met). He was so pleasant. I have required wheelchair assistance when traveling for over 7 years and Alejandro is hands down the best.",1
2023-09-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,the most inefficient TSA security checkpoint,False,"  The gate agents are great, but they might have the most inefficient TSA security checkpoint I’ve ever witnessed. It took them around 30 minutes to scan 15 bags and only one was flagged out of the 15. They seem to be the only airport where the analogic machines have actually made the security checkpoint slower, which is wild considering the technology of those things. Everywhere else seems to have competent people to run them.",-1
2023-08-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,What a discombobulated mess,False,  What a discombobulated mess! I bought TSA pre check to expedite airport security but what I witnessed today was a nightmare. Their new TSA pre check area and process for screening is atrocious. The plastic bins don't go in the same order as the prior who pass through - the person in front of me received his second container after I had received my first and the person after me had a container come through before mine as well. It creates longer wait times and more people standing around waiting for the bins. Lots of confusion causing additional travel stress.,-1
2022-12-30,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,hour for the baggage belt to even turn on,False,Lousy baggage claim. Actually the worst ever ! And it’s consistently bad. An hour for the baggage belt to even turn on is completely unacceptable - pitiful!,-1
2022-06-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,basic customer service has gone out the window,False,"  I was checking in my 15 yr old daughter for her flight to Chicago, to visit her father for the summer. She travels as an unaccompanied minor but we still like to walk her to her gate, sit with her while she waits and say our goodbyes before she gets on her flight. I have had minor issues with doing this with other airlines, due to security concerns/COVID/9-11 but this most recent visit, I feel I have to say something about the customer service. We get to the airport 1.5 hours before her flight. It's me, my daughter and her half sister. The ticketing agent was not pleasant from the word go. No greeting, no ""hi, how are you"", just a very bland ""how can I help you"". She asked me for ID and I said ""mine or my daughter's"" - as my 15 year old doesn't have an ID as she doesn't drive yet nor does she have a job. She got a bit of an attitude and was like ""hers"" meaning my daughter. I stated she did not have one for said reasons above. She proceeds to check my daughter in and as that is going on, I tell the ticketing agent that me and her half sister will need passes to walk her to the gate. She finishes with my daughter, then asks for my ID. I give it to her, she checks me in and gives me a gate pass and sends me on my way. I tell her I need a gate pass for her 17 year old half sister. She asks for her ID and when we told her it was in the car and we weren't sure she needed it, she was like ""of course she needs it, if she wants a gate pass, she needs to have an ID"". Me, not traveling much, didn't know the rules so I had both girls run out to the car (which was not close), get the ID and run back. My daughter was very distraught at this point and we are getting close to her departure time. I calmed her down, we go back to the ticketing agent where a man took over getting her the gate pass and we were on our way. We then get to the TSA line and it was a disaster. The line was miles long and travelers were stressing about missing flights. The line moved S-L-O-W. We had less than 30 min to get through TSA and to her gate. A lady in front of us asked a TSA employee about the line and what could be done to move it along faster and the TSA employee stated ""Lady, a lot of people are going to miss flights today"". I know airports are crazy and it was the start of summer but basic customer service has gone out the window. Almost every airport employee we encountered was rude.",1
2019-07-10,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,Poorly run with no concern for passengers,False,  Waited 1 hour in line to be checked by TSA. Unacceptable. Poorly run with no concern for passengers. Attitude of staff. For such a small terminal there should be a more efficient way to expedite passengers through and still provide the required safety needed. At least 15 passengers did not make their flight on this one airline due to the inefficiency of TSA. These passengers arrived an hour or more before flight. Totally disappointed.,-1
2019-06-11,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Very good experience,False," On June 7, 2018, I was departing from Jacksonville airport on American Airlines to Philadelphia, flight 4705. At Gate C8, an employee who was very supportive and accommodating to me. She was extremely busy; however, took the time to be sure I had a wheelchair waiting in Philadelphia. She also arranged to have me boarded early with someone. She offered to check my carryon bag as I was having difficulty. This woman is a credit to American Airlines. The plane was extremely cold the flight attendant gave me a blanket which I did not know were available. Very good experience.",1
2019-06-10,0.5,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,Who talks like that to people?,False,"  Unfortunately security staff at airport security check point was very rude, it was a male security officer. I placed my belongings in tray at check in point than on rolling rack and attempted to walk away. He came yelling - “whose stuff if is? Who is watching your stuff? You like you staff than stay there”! He sounded and behaved literally like an abusive spouse. What is this? Boot camp? Who talks like that to people? Most people coming to airport are stressed out already, and last thing anyone needs is a stranger coming out of nowhere yelling at them when only simple redirection is needed. What about being calm and professional instead? Otherwise airport was clean and easy to use, also rest of employees we encountered were very polite. Just this one individual gave airport bad rep for a day.",-1
