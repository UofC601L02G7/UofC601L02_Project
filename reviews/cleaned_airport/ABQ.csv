2024-06-15,0.2,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,airport offers zero amenities,True,  This airport offers zero amenities to the traveler. Probably the most boring place I have waited for a flight. Old equipment at TSA slows progress in getting screened. Few restaurants and even fewer bars. Zero lounges and almost no place to charge a device. It's definitely a miserable enough place that I would no longer consider a trip to New Mexico if it involves this airport!,-1
2023-10-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,,3.0,,everyone needs to charge their devices,True,   Only wall outlets and had to try 3 different ones to find one that worked. It's 2023 and everyone needs to charge their devices. First trip to Albuquerque. Attended balloon Fiesta which brings in over 200 million. Think city could put some into upgrading airport. Not happy.,-1
2023-10-15,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,Warning to all ADA travelers,True," Warning to all ADA travelers. I you have a wheelchair there is no transportation services offered at this airport! No shuttles, taxi, or local services but the public bus.",-1
2022-05-07,0.2,Business,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,extremely disappointed in the way they handled security,True,"  I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled security. Initially I was thrilled at the process and not separating people from their luggage like so many others. However, one of my bags got 'flagged' (ended up being for a stack of business cards) and it sat waiting to be checked for over 15 minutes. During that time I asked 4 different people about it and was brushed off with comments like 'They're sending someone over' or 'I'm sure they'll take care of it"" and they just walked off. It almost made me miss my flight and was just completely NOT okay. If they had even spoken to me and treated me like a person that mattered it would have been more palatable, but this negative experience will override any positive about this airport.",-1
2022-04-19,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements",True," ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",1
2021-06-28,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Very frustrating,False,"  Very frustrating - today 6/27, 11.30 am, B gates going through pre-check TSA my husband was returning with our son (12) to San Diego. The lady at TSA said “our son couldn’t go through security without an ID”. Patently false - he flew RT to Texas the week prior. This is a training issue and she almost caused them to miss their flight! Please train your staff!",-1
2021-01-07,0.2,Business,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,I have had horrid customer service,False,"  Avoid American Airlines at this airport. I have had horrid customer service in December 2020 and January 2021. I had a female ticketing agent charge me $170 for 1 overweight bag (54 lbs) because she claimed my husband's military orders were dated in March. Orders aren't posted the month you transfer ma'am. As a 17 year active duty wife, I may know a thing or two. Then said ""just because you are a military dependent doesn't mean you get free luggage"". I never in my life have experienced such horrid disrespect. On top of it I am a COVID crisis relief RN. I was blown away and have since vowed to never fly American again.",-1
2019-05-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,1.0,lines were so incredibly long,False," This airport can’t seem to handle the passenger traffic. I was flying American on May 21, my flight was delayed to the point that I wouldn’t make my transfer. I was bumped to the next day and the check-in lines were so incredibly long that I missed my flight the next morning and was forced to fly standby. I have heard similar things from friends flying Southwest Airlines at this airport",-1
2018-03-01,0.2,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,TSA are almost always rude,False,"  
Very rude TSA, been through many time and always felt it was very quick and easier to get through other than the airport staff. Not the airline staff, they are great. But TSA are almost always rude, barely smile and speak down to people going through. Not just my family but others around us in the line, and really there is nothing you can say. It is not necessary to always look like you are in a bad mood and don't want to be at work.",-1
