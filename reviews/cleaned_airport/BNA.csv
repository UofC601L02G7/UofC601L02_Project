2024-03-31,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,,5.0,"poorly planned annex wing"" ",False,"   I'm not sure what ultimate plan is for gates C4- C11 is, but in its current state, its awful. I have never walked as much as I have in an airport as I have here. The shuttle bus process is really bad. Driving in a fully loaded bus with NO air is un excusable. The two tiny windows that were letting a tiny bit of air were not enough. We ended up sitting on the bus for a good 4 or 5 minutes while we waited for 3 Southwest planes to pass. When the last jet went by and started throttling up we got a nice HOT blast of the smell of jet fuel.  I can't say that I won't be back, but we may change airlines so we don't need to endure the poorly planned annex wing.",1
2024-03-22,0.3,Business,1.0,2.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Poor design and poor governance,False,  Shuttle between terminals to get to bag claim takes forever. Very poor design has shuttle bus.  Absolutely no controls at ride share pickup. Ubers double parried everywhere created 15 minute traffic jam delay. If you come to Nashville airport plan to wait. Everything takes three times longer than required. Poor design and poor governance.,-1
2023-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst experience arriving,False,"  Worst experience arriving to an airport. Have to stand in extremely long line waiting for shuttle to take you to main terminal to then get your bags and rental car. Took over 15 minutes standing in line with no official information from the airport staff. All information came from locals who were also in the line. Worst experience, arriving in a city. No soap on the ladies bathroom. Finally get on the shuttle to stand on the runway waiting for planes to taxi in and out. So now on a crowded shuttle watching planes move all around and still not to the terminal. Absolutely ridiculous and a miserable introduction to a city.",-1
2023-11-26,0.5,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,employees had zero sense,True,"  After having stood in line with my family for an hour and finally reaching the check-in counters for our airline, we were told to wait while while another 20+ people checked in before us, causing us to wait another 30 minutes. We were the only ones going to a separate state, so it would have been so easy to just check our 2 bags when we first got to check-in. So because adults couldn't plan ahead and get to the airport with plenty of time for their flight, we were the ones that had to stand there and wait for them. We finally made it to our gate with 10 minutes to spare. To say I was angry and frustrated that the employees had zero sense, is an understatement.",-1
2023-10-31,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,Had a great experience,True,"  Had a great experience. Going through security was fast, had no wait time. They had great local beers on tap and even a smoking section. It costs 10 bucks to enter, but considering I haven't been in an airport that had one in 15 years it made the wait SO much better. 10/10 will layover in.",1
2023-04-04,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,unsatisfactory and unacceptable,True, I am writing to complain about the cost of long-term economy parking. I have lived in large cities around the country and long-term economy parking is around 8-10$ per day. This airport has continuously raised its long-term parking fee over the last few years to a now astronomical amount of 18$ per day! That is unsatisfactory and unacceptable. There have been no improvements to the parking lot and there are not buses running more often to them. Why the unreasonable raise. The traffic at the terminals themselves is also horrible. People will be waiting for almost an hour to pick someone up around the holidays.,-1
2023-04-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,everything is worse than was before,True,"  Getting in and out of the airport is now a real problem. Traffic does not flow around and is backed up constantly. New design has added stop lights which just backs up traffic even more. Years ago, BNA built a parking deck, then 2 years ago tore it down to do the new terminal and parking. Now everything is worse than was before. Even the shuttles to the parking areas are affected and now take forever to go to and from the pickup/drop off areas. Parking spaces are blocked off, constant construction. Cell phone lots have moved off site causing drivers to “Park” on the road. Traffic cops at arrivals do not enforce people from parking and moving on causing traffic to back up all the way around the short term parking area.",-1
2022-12-23,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,Very very dissatisfied,False, Flight 1101. Dec 23 12:23AM: We have been sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours tonight. Yes there was some snow here. We were told there are no open gates. Get the other passengers off the planes at the gates if they aren’t going to fly out. There is no reason for planes to stay boarded sitting and blocking the gates. Ridiculous. Very very dissatisfied.,-1
2022-11-21,0.9,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,super customer friendly service,True, Fantastic. Ample and clean restrooms. Great restaurants. Napping rooms available to rent. Everyone was kind and assisted as needed. They asked me if I needed help. Super customer friendly service.,1
2022-09-16,0.2,Business,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Extremely noisy,False,"  Extremely noisy. Loud music, requiring loud announcements. In C terminal floor constantly shakes, it seems to be an engineering flaw. Avoid if you need to layover.",-1
2022-06-03,0.4,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,food and shops quite sparse,True,"  This was my first visit to Nashville airport and it will be my last. We arrived to fly back home to the UK. Airport was under construction, very few seats to sit while you waited for check-in to open. No where to purchase any snacks while waiting. After we checked in we had priority security. We proceeded to use priority lane but got so far and it was closed. There was a few of us and we had to join the end of the queue. One of the gentlemen asked a TSA agent what was happening with security. She was extremely rude and dismissive of him. So much for friendly and helpful staff! After security the selection of food and shops is quite sparse. Not what I would have expected from an airport the size of Nashville. We were extremely disappointed with our experience of this airport!",-1
2022-05-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,I was exhausted and had no one to ask for directions!,False,"  Before I arrived, I called to check on parking. The last time I was there the sign pointed straight ahead for Terminal B parking. Didn't know you had to drive all the way around the airport to find Terminal B because there were no more signs. So, the operator who answered was very condescending and impatient. As if I was taking up his time. The place can be very confusing if you only use it every couple of years. I took the ""shuttle"" to the terminal. On the way home, in the baggage area, a sign said ""shuttles"" with an arrow. I walked and walked and walked with my bags to where there were buses. I asked which one to Terminal B parking. They were all buses to hotels! I was exhausted and had no one to ask for directions! They need people in booths or walking around who can answer questions!",1
2022-02-23,0.2,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,I turned in a complaint to the airport and was basically told tough luck,False,  I fly frequently in and out of Nashville Airport and don't really have ever any problems until today. My kids were in town and I had to take them to the airport for the return flight home. They are Minors so I went in with them to make sure they got on board the plane ok. I parked in the parking garage for less than 2 hours and was charged a full 1 day rate of 26 dollars. That rate kicks in at 45 minutes. I believe that is absurd. I don't have a problem paying to park but don't feel like I should have had to pay the full day rate. Don't get me wrong it isn't that I don't have the funds but it really the principle of it. I usually park off site because the rates are better and the shuttle service is better as well. I feel the full day rate shouldn't kick it until about 3 or 4 hours in the garage. I mean if you parked and took a flight somewhere it would take 3 to 4 hours to get there and back without really getting off a plane. So I turned in a complaint to the airport and was basically told tough luck. So my sentiment is Nashville Airport your customer service sucks. Do better. Not to mention the entire airport is a construction site inside and out.,1
2021-12-30,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Very disappointed and very disrespectful,False,"  I just dropped my Aunt off at the airport to catch her flight. I was parked for 5 min max with my Caution lights on in the terminal. As soon as I unloaded the car and told her goodbye, I got back in the vehicle and the traffic guy (about 60yr old) is yelling at me to move. I said I’m about to move I’m just starting my GPS, which takes 1 min. He then proceeded to come up to my window and yell and tell me “I don’t care what your doing, you can put your GPS on somewhere else. You need to move.” By this point I could’ve been done and gone if he wasn’t causing an issue over me dropping off my relative and only being there for 5 min. I know his job is important. I know it is important to try and keep traffic going so it doesn’t back up. What I don’t agree with is being rude while doing it. Everyone is there to do the same thing. It isn’t going to make things better, or traffic go any faster, by being rude and inconsiderate of others. Very disappointed and very disrespectful. He needs to be written up for this.",1
2021-11-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,Seriously BNA get your act together,False,"  I have flown many times out of BNA never that much of a problem until this last flight, I would have driven to my destination had I known what a mess it is, now don't think I want to fly out of Nashville ever again. I was over 2 hrs early and only made it to the gate with 1 hr to wait. What happened to all the quick places to grab some food? Seriously BNA get your act together.",-1
2021-11-03,0.5,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,on track to reinvent our outdated BNA airport,False,"  In the heart of the South, on track to reinvent our outdated BNA airport. I have a question. Why is there no where to buy a Mountain Dew, Sun Drop, or Mello Yellow? I mean this is the South correct?",1
2021-08-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,No employees enforced the mask rule,False,  A lot of people not wearing masks. No employees enforced the mask rule. The food employees were yelling at each other not wearing masks. The employees are rude. The airport is so dirty. I will never come here again.,-1
2021-07-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,there were so many people not wearing masks,False,  Although there were motivations in place and visible—there were so many people not wearing masks and the airport authority did not seem to care. I brought my own Lysol wipes and glad I did. I tried to sit in a chair but when I wiped it down the cloth showed so much grime and dirt that I ended up standing while I waited to board and I was pretty early. Cleaning crew were standing around talking on their phones while germs are having a field day on every surface of this airport. I live in Nashville and used to fly frequently. However now I’ll be seriously thinking twice about travel!,-1
2021-05-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,I thought I was in a 1970’s low budget film,False,"  I thought I was in a 1970’s low budget film. This place has outdated, smelly, nasty carpet, broken seat and 2 1/2 restaurants. I may be stretching it on the 2 1/2 restaurants but what few restaurants they do have are very poor.",-1
2021-04-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Lack of places to eat,False,  Infrastructure is poor. Lack of places to eat. Long lines at the few open food vendors. High priced and low quality food. Ugly terminal. No staff available for directions/questions.,-1
2021-02-16,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,the airport is supposed to be prepared for planes to fly!,True," We came to Nashville to visit. There was bad weather when we left, so I can understand that these may be special circumstances. That being said, all flights were cancelled little by little. They kept you in the airport for as long as possible. 1 restaurant that sits probably 30 people, 2 stores that were poorly stocked with disgusting sandwiches, 1 small bar. Al this to serve hundreds of people that are waiting to see if their flights will be cancelled or not. Finally, after 24hrs of being moved around from gate to gate and delayed, they got us on a plane. The pilot explained what led to all the delays and why we are still delayed. The Airport has only 1 Defreezer truck. It can de freeze 1-2 planes then has to go refuel, which takes 2 hrs. So, we were waiting for our turn to be defreezed. After about 20 min, the pilot gave us an update saying that the defreezer has a malfunction and the tech is coming to fix it. A little later, we got an update that said: well, I can see that there is only 1 person loading the luggage’s, so this may take a little while before we can even move the plane. In the meantime, we are still waiting on the update for the defreezer. A few minutes later, the pilot says we just found out that the mechanic is on his way and should be there in about 30 min. Damn. I’m not sure what is going on, but the airport is supposed to be prepared for planes to fly!",-1
2020-11-25,0.4,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,The cell phone parking lot is a disaster,False,  The cell phone parking lot is a disaster. Like a bad game of Tetris. I won’t use it again until it’s redone. Alarmist saw two wrecks. It’s necessary to be able to back in to park or you’re out of luck.,1
2020-01-30,0.3,Business,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,it has never been a good experience,False,"  Lived here over 15 years and this is our home airport traveling at least every 3-4 weeks. We’ve been using this airport for years and it has never been a good experience. Security and parking is fine, even with the construction - no problems other than if you have an early flight give yourself time to park if you need the bus. As far as food options... it’s terrible. The Berry Bistro is the only option on the Southwest terminal side to get any sort of coffee that’s to go other than Starbucks. Starbucks takes over 20 minutes because they are the only ones with reliable options. The Berry Bistro two weeks ago was closed because no staff showed up to work in the am. Today (like 3 other times) they’ve had our order wrong, over charged us and then didn’t have the items they said they did. When we asked for a refund they couldn’t because they didn’t have a manager to approve so they had to get change out of their wallets to refund us. All the other food options in the court area have cold food, even in the warmers, the staff can’t speak English. If your going to expand this airport you need to massively step it up with a manager that can oversee these places and hire people that care to be working for the day not texting on their phones at the register. This airport is WAY behind the eight ball, compared to other similar markets around the country ie., Charlotte, Orlando, West Palm, St Louis. Your expansion plan must include better staffing and food options. Not to mention the one clothing store Fly Babies has had the same clothes for 15 years in the same spot. Update?",-1
2019-12-18,0.7,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,Step it up a notch people,False,"  Construction is taking forever and is very noisy and messy, my kids tripped on some construction material in a normal walkway but I am mainly posting this review because their toilet tissue is absolutely terrible! It’s like using printer paper and it gave me a terrible rash. Thumbs down big time for a simple commodity BNA. Lastly the security personnel could be a touch more humane, they have constantly been rude and demanding to my family over the years and other innocent parties doing nothing wrong at all. Step it up a notch people. Hope you read this for all the unspoken parties out there and get to work where you are falling short.",1
2019-08-12,0.5,Business,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no paper towels are offered,True," I live in Nashville and fly somewhere around 75 times a year. BNA is currently undergoing some significant expansion and renovations that are necessary to keep up with the demand of Nashville’s incredible population growth. What continues to be overlooked are the restroom facilities. It’s the only airport I’ve traveled to or through where no paper towels are offered, which is a major invitation to spread sickness especially when coupled with the dryers that require poor hand washers to stick their hands fully in the machine and blow around all of the bacteria and germs they didn’t wash off with soap. Additionally, multiple sinks are always out of soap or the soap dispensers are not functioning properly. BNA must have the most germ and bacteria friendly airport for any city with major commercial airlines.",-1
2019-05-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,Employees rude and obnoxious,False,"  So....most food vendors were filthy, most closed but no reason why, just rude employees waving you away. Coolers where drinks are grabbed from completely empty and again dirty. Burger King however was open but all counters and floor were dirty and greasy. Employees rude and obnxious. Don't waste your time or your money. I would rather stop somewhere pick up something that cost less and eat it cold than eat at BNA.",-1
2019-04-26,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5.0,"happy, calm, and full of personality",False,"  TSA probably doesn’t get that many good reviews but I wanted to say a huge thank you to all the TSA folks I talked with. You were happy, calm, and full of personality. You made going through security a breeze and for that I thank you for keeping the morning happy. I wish every airport had TSA like Nashville! Well done",1
2018-11-10,1.0,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,so thankful for everything,False,  My parents and I were about to board a flight and my dad started feeling sick. He was having a heart attack. Everyone at the airport was so nice and helpful. They got help to him so quick! A lady (I’m not real sure who she was) got our flights changed for us and got our luggage off the plane. A security guard stayed with me the whole time and helped me with everything! They were so wonderful and I’m so thankful for everything they did for us!,1
2018-06-06,0.8,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,tremendous in doing their job,False,"  My 14 year old grand daughter flew unattended by an adult to JAX and the ladies at the check-in in the secure area were tremendous in doing their job. Answered all questions and put us at ease, got her on the plane and in a great seat without having to wrestle with the masses that were waiting to board. A big thank you to Southwest also. Now, parking was another thing, a nightmare with all the construction going on but we made it just fine.",1
2017-11-19,0.7,Business,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,the service is super slow,True, Nashville airport is notorious at taking forever to get the bags unloaded to the carousel. We wait an additional 20 minutes just to get a bag. This happens all the time. The staff are nice but the service is super slow.,1
2017-04-26,0.5,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,not a pleasant experience,False,"  We checked into the counter to the friendliest agents we've seen in a long time. The security checkpoint was understaffed and the woman checking us in was unpleasant to say the least. No smile, crabby attitude and just not happy with her job. She asked a co-worker for some help as she had already called for help three times. I was TSA prechecked, but ended up having to take my belt off and go through again. Then my bracelets and go through again. And then once more through and a final pat down. All the agents here were friendly and just doing their job, but next time I think I'll just go through the regular line and it'll probably go smoother. Not a pleasant experience.",-1
2017-01-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Nashville you're doing it right,False,"  I've traveled for years - this is the first airport I have ever reviewed. Nashville staff were amazing - the TSA in most airports are the worst part of traveling! Most agents have an entitlement attitude, Nashville Airport TSA was excellent, something I've never experienced in an US airport. The staff were nice, the airport to was clean, and they had live music to ease you. Nashville you're doing it right, everyone seems to be happy - as a traveler I left as content as I arrived.",1
