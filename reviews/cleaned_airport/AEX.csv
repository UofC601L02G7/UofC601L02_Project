2022-10-22,0.4,Business,1,3,2,3,0,,,2,Do not arrive too early,True,  Do not arrive too early. We arrived 3 hours before-my friend was flying on a slightly earlier flight and I was told to wait outside as my flight was slightly later. No preliminary information.so had to wait an hour. Finally allowed inside the building where there were 5 security checks - really strange as the checks involved the same things. After all that my friends plane was still on the tarmac as we took off. Airport was clean and seemed well organised once inside but being kept outside was risky.,-1

Security was reasonably efficient and courteous. Limited food and beverage service. Quick baggage retrieval. Extremely clean toilets. Very close to city, hotels and restaurants. I would highly recommend Alexandria International (AEX) when traveling to Central or Northern Louisiana.",1
