2024-09-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,What a disappointment,False,"  First time at this airport. What a disappointment after such a great cruise vacation. Long line backed into traffic just to get to departure gates. When we tried to check our bags at the kiosk, it wouldn't work so, we waited in line 15 minutes to get assistance only to be told that Seattle doesn't allow bags to be checked more than 4 hrs before flight. What the heck!! So now we're stuck standing with 4 pcs of luggage because AA pushed our flight back by 2 hrs. No place to sit! The 3 or 4 small eateries were quickly taken up with people dragging lg suitcases who refused to give up their seat once they finished eating. The area near luggage check quickly got overcrowded with people pulling many large suitcases. To have this ""4-hr"" policy & no general seating (handicap only), makes no sense. Once we finally checked the bags & went to TSA, another nightmare. An hour + at least in line. One of the employees directing people said the reason for the madness was 2 cruise ships just disembarked with 10,000 ppl. Miami doesn't have an issue. Workers are rude & not enough body scanners. I and my carry-on went through the metal detector only to be told that because my knees set it off, I should now go to the line 4 lanes over with a full body scanner. Crazy!! Put scanners at all the TSA lanes! Once we got to our gate (escalator was broken), it was dirty, torn seats and smelled. Only 1 working bathroom in that concourse & it was nasty with no soap in any of the dispensers (women's). The air at the terminal was stagnant & warm. Due to the construction, I don't think there was any ventilation. The icing on the cake is when I overheard an annoyed pilot speaking with a flight attendant saying how much he hates flying into this airport. If you can avoid this airport, do it!",-1
2024-09-09,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,avoid this airport if you can,False,"  Late arrival due to fog. Global Entry couldn't read my info. Re-screening after customs is understaffed and slow. Reader boards are not working right, and don't match boarding pass gates. My assumption is that checked luggage will not make it to my destination with my connecting flight - it never has when passing through customs. Just avoid this airport if you can.",-1
2024-09-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Completely over crowded,False,"  Completely over crowded, not enough seating. Air is stagnant, hot, smelly. Food is outrageously overpriced and very low quality. Seating, when you find it, is dirty and old.",-1
2024-08-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,TSA lines were very long,False," Arrived on United flight early Saturday afternoon. The walk to baggage claim was long and confusing. Waited about 30 more minutes for bags to arrive. Arrival/pickup area outside was chaotic, traffic was 4 lanes deep, and stretched out from the terminal building. Departed on red eye Monday Morning. Kiosk check-in stations did not work, United rep confirmed they don’t work. TSA lines were very long, and TSA directions were not clearly posted or announced. There were not enough baggage totes to use for the X-ray machines. Long lines and confusing getting through TSA. Again the walk to the United gate was very long.",-1
2024-06-30,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,now rivals LAX in terms of chaos,False,"   SeaTac now rivals LAX in terms of chaos, in my opinion. We waited in a line of 100+ people for the shuttle. (After spending about 20 minutes trying to even find where to go). There was no signage and the path to get there is a construction zone right now; we had to weave around various obstacles. We got on the 4th shuttle after about 30 minutes of waiting. Then we had to wait 45 min in line to actually get the car that I had already paid for and had already pre-checked in for (well that’s Budget’s fault, not SeaTac’s). Between these issues and taxiing on the runway, I didn’t leave the airport until 3 hours after touching down. I also had a bad experience last year when flying out of SeaTac, I almost missed my flight despite arriving 90 minutes early because of their “spot saver” program. People are allowed to just cut in line for the security check. This is not the regular pre-check program, this is just people who know about the app before they arrive to the airport and can sign up to skip in line",-1
2024-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,This airport is a joke,False,"   This airport is a joke. So spread out. Poor/confusing signage. So difficult to move around the airport to gate locations. The ""train"" system is a farce. Takes so long to get between terminals. I suppose if you use the airport a lot you ""know"" the in's and out's of how it operates. If you are a first timer I am afraid it is an airport to lay down and avoid if you can. Took us 1.5 hours from time we arrived at the airport to get to the gate in the ""S"" terminal. TSA was slow, transiting inside the airport was slow. Then we missed the flight by 2 mins. That's another issue with Frontier! If you do have to use this airport I suggest you add at least 1.5 hours to what you normally expect at other airports. When we arrived it was no better. Took so long to get from the arrival gate to the off airport rental car location. The place is a mess and who ever designed it needs a head read. It's just nasty. Seems whoever owns this place is more focused on building a sprawling ediface than serving the people that use it. So sad in a first world country to have to endure a place like this. It would be interesting stat to know how many people have missed flights from Sea Tac in last 3 months? A lot would be my opinion.",-1
2024-06-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,“single worst US airport experience”,False,"  The single worst US airport experience I’ve ever had. I’m an extremely experienced traveler and have had better experiences in many third world airports. I will take connections, fly red eyes, drive coast to coast, or do whatever else is necessary to avoid this airport in the future.",-1
2024-06-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,,2.0,“Customer service was extremely lacking”,False," Customer service was extremely lacking in care and concern for their customers. Requests were ignored. Communication poor between agents. Travel through the airport was difficult because of the long distances with only two short people movers. Airport under construction so had to disembark to a shuttle, that broke down, then to a tram just to get to the terminal. For some needing a wheelchair, good luck; uncomfortable metal carts where the porters drop you off and left you there with no way to get around afterwards (bathroom, food, water) it took agents 30 to 45 minutes to get a wheelchair for assistance. Long long distances between bathrooms. Our ticket agent was very good trying to handle the request, just no help from other until boarding time then porter was helpful.",-1
2024-06-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,just not a good experience,False,"   Construction at the airport and it is an absolute nightmare. On my arrival it was very difficult to find the way out and there are no corresponding signs inside and outside to coordinate a meeting point. On my departure I arrived two hours before a domestic flight and missed my flight. The TSA lines were absolutely awful. There is no direction, no way to find the end of the incredibly long lines. You can pay for special lines (Clear and Pre-check) which seem to be better staffed but who knows if that would have helped. I was booked on a later flight so I stored my bags, very hard to find, another long line. The air-train into Seattle was great! Only $3 and easy to navigate. Once back for my later flight I had to wait forever to retrieve my bags and go back through security. It took almost an hour with a spot saver at a time the airport was not crowded. The closest bathrooms were closed, no bottle filler close by, just not a good experience at all. My plane was then delayed over an hour waiting for flight crew while we sat on the tarmac. In a city rich with technology, you would think the airport would be better.",-1
2024-06-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,“customer satisfaction was not a priority”,False," I recently had the misfortune of passing through Sea/Tac Airport, and I must say, it was an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. From the moment I stepped foot inside, I was greeted with an atmosphere of disdain and hostility that permeated every corner of the terminal. The staff, if you can even call them that, were the epitome of rudeness. It was as if they had undergone special training in how to make passengers feel unwelcome and inconvenienced. Any attempt at seeking assistance was met with eye rolls, sighs of exasperation, and curt, dismissive responses. It's as if they viewed travelers not as valued customers, but as nuisances disrupting their day. The lack of basic courtesy was astonishing. It's one thing to encounter a grumpy employee here or there, but it seemed like a pervasive culture of indifference had infected the entire workforce. It was abundantly clear that customer satisfaction was not a priority for them. To add insult to injury, the facilities were woefully inadequate. Long queues snaked through the terminal, with no discernible logic or organization. Overall, my experience at Sea/Tac Airport left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. It's a shame that such a crucial hub for travel can be so poorly managed and staffed by individuals who seem to take pleasure in making passengers' lives miserable. I would advise anyone considering flying through this airport to think twice and explore alternative options if possible.",-1
2024-05-30,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,escorted me back to Agricultural Products,False,"   ""Welcome to the United States."" (Message to international visitors and returning residents at Seattle/Tacoma International Airport). A connecting flight in Amsterdam with a 90-minute window turned into a sprint for the gate after a backlog at Passport Control. The employees there worked hard to continue monitoring the flight departures of those waiting. The backlog was, apparently due to current U.S. mandates about rechecking all passports at certain airports, including Schiphol/Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Perhaps some European airports are more experienced in handling security and passport control. They were, after all, screening passengers more closely for nearly a half-century before American airports did more than x-ray bags and ask international passengers to declare duty items purchased overseas. We Americans did not appear very popular in the overseas airport on that day. A kind Croatian friend gave me fruit for the journey. She has never had means to travel or the luxury of wasting food, so can't comprehend the immediate confiscation of food products upon arrival in U.S. She also speaks better English than the male Passport Control official at Window 13, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, whose questions consisted of the following: (missing verbs are his, not my transcribing) ""Why you in Amsterdam? Why you in Vienna? Why you bring fruit?"" I had to repeat myself twice and raise my voice several volumes for his comprehension. He then had me escorted to the empty Agricultural Products area, where the two personnel at X-ray aisle 15 threw the produce away. When I asked if I could eat my two apples and a tangerine in their view, one said: ""This isn't a dining area."" The other said that fruits and vegetables couldn't enter the country. ""Regulations"". I believe she meant unpackaged. And, of course, they were already IN the country. And, of course, the regulations quoted state that these foods must be declared. No displayed regulation states that they must be confiscated without chance of consumption, thereby raising the chances of unpackaged food going unreported and actually moving through the country. When I retrieved some of my belongings, I told the personnel that I would know how to handle any produce in future. Both told me that my ""threat was recorded on security cameras."" Note: I had forgotten to remove the paring knife provided by my Croatian hostess, which was in my carry-on bag. It traveled through all security without incident, including the rechecks in Seattle/Tacoma International Airport. I still have it. My duty-free bag didn't exit with my other luggage. I went back for it. Two security guards' escorted me back to Agricultural Products, one checking the bag (which had already been through Passport Control with the aforementioned official at Window 13), checking receipts, asking to verify the credit card used for purchase, then escorting me out. Apparently security doubles for Agricultural Produce employees? Security guards now assume the duties of Customs officials? No one else seems to be carrying them out. What is that costing the U.S. in Customs duties? Everyone was busy with a tangerine and two apples and a duty-free bag. I sincerely thank all of the flight and gate personnel at Seattle/Tacoma International. The less said about certain Ag Produce and Passport Control personnel, the better.",-1
2024-05-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Worst airport ever,False,"   Worst airport ever. Confusing. Seattle airport changes gates two or three times. I'm handicapped. One of The w/c helpers dropped me off at my gate, I didn't know where to go, I'm not able to walk well. How is an elderly person supposed to navigate on their own? When I asked for help finding my new gate, I was ignored, they are too busy to help. Why aren't people notified when gates are changed.? Their must be a better way. I hope I never have to go there again.",-1
2024-05-09,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,TSA was horrible,False,   This is the airport where I have had my worst experience.  It took three hours to make it to my connecting flight after flying in internationally. TSA was horrible. It was a single lane for the majority of the passengers and TSA agents could care less. They couldn’t have been less empathetic. I had a three hour layover and barely made my flight. Lots of others missed their flights.,-1
2024-05-06,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,inefficient frustrating slow process,True,"  A lack of leadership from top down creates an inefficient frustrating slow process for travelers, consistently, no matter the day or time of year, that is made worse by an arrogant, snarky, reactive, other-blaming attitudes throughout the departure process, and there is an effort made to communicate that everyone is doing the best they can and nothing is their fault and that it is just a hard day. These lies could not be believed by even the one saying them. There is no effort to improve conditions. Driving through arrivals/departures there is no order or enforcement and it is like the wild Wild West. I don’t want to make friends with a representative or customer agent, I want to get where I am going. There is no good reason that anyone needs to arrive 3 hours before and miss a flight. The bandaid relative solution of a spot saver is the worst idea ever. 5 lines of paid or tech-savvy people all flowing through a slow process of TSA who just won’t be told what to do and won’t change because they think what they are doing is working. It isn’t. Ask anyone who has ever traveled through any other airport. Hire an outside leadership group to identify the problems, or anyone who works and lives outside of the Portland/Seattle area, get rid of the people who won’t change, and then start to get to normal. Then once it becomes mediocre you will have a different perspective on where is possible to go from there.",-1
2024-05-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,Please make signs,True,"  It took me roughly an hour to find vehicle help. I got back to my car after my trip and found out my car battery was dead. I went back inside the airport to find help. After like 30 minutes I found someone who was directing people to the different airlines front desks. I asked him if I could get help getting my vehicle jumped. He said no, I would have to call a tow company or AAA. That made sense because I didn't see any signs for this around. I looked in the second and 4th floors of the parking garage. My wife finally texts me and says I can go to 3rd floor of the parking garage and trade my driver's license for a jump starter. I was baffled because no where in the entire airport does it say this, not even asking an airport employee. Please make signs.",1
2024-04-30,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The worst airport ever,False,"   The worst airport ever. I arrived to the airport 2,5 hours in advance. The waiting time in the line was 90 mins. Never had experience like this before. Plus 15 min for luggage checking, 10 min to get from the car to the airport - 30 min left. I needed to use a train to get my gate - by jogging, it took about 20 min. I arrived to my gate 15 min before departure ... the gate was still open. When I got to the plaane, it was almost empty, really (a busy evening flight Seattle-Atlanta) - many people, who arrived 2 hours in advance, just missed this flight. Alaska Airlines made comments that ""today we have very light flight"", and took off exactly on time, not waiting anybody. The worst airport ever.",-1
2024-03-14,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,TSA lines were horribly inefficient,False, TSA lines were horribly inefficient and staff were incredibly rude and inhospitable. Treating all customers so rudely does nothing but add stress. The airport is a total disaster.,-1
2024-01-26,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,“avoid it like the plague” ,False," Such a dreadful experience. Long story short: DO NOT TRANSIT THROUGH THIS AIRPORT. Want details? Read on: I often travel in Africa, Europe and the USA, and I have transited through the USA- been through Denver, through JFK, through San Francisco, even Washington DC. In my 7 years of travelling across the US, never in my life have I ever faced an airport with such stupid processes, such laziness, such disorganization in my life! I booked a premium Virgin Atlantic flight to San Jose which had me transiting for the first time through Seattle. Layover time: 70 minutes on the ticket. At Heathrow, the check-in desk informed me I would need to pick up my bags then drop them off again. I thought nothing of it, thinking it would be a transit as usual. Now Virgin Atlantic even landed 25 minutes earlier, giving me 95 minutes to transit. Who created the baggage claim before passport control system? That team or person must be inhumane or just plain dumb. What happens to people who have connecting flights? It makes no sense. Took me 20 minutes to get to and claim my baggage (excellent job on Virgin Atlantic and the ground crew!) another 40 minutes through passport control, and 60 minutes through TSA. They had just one lane for hundreds of people transiting. Then after about 20 minutes someone with an iota of common sense opened another lane. Then the TSA agent opened my sealed Duty Free bag of champagne to test it, saying it flagged up on the system. After testing the glass bottle she then offered I check it in or abandon it because it could not go with me. I told her my flight left 5 minutes ago - she then had a physical malfunction. You could see it in her face. She did not know what to say. Then she had to pat me down, running through their bloody speech as you do. I was clear & vocal about my thoughts, my irritations, and my impressions of Seattle airport to any staff within earshot. That TSA agent was a robot. On the one side I felt for her, on the other I decided to put myself first too. Other passengers near me and even a couple of her colleagues were sympathetic and wondered why it needed checking when it was sealed. I should have gotten her name, but I was in a rush to get the next flight. I was not about to be stuck in this city for another moment more than necessary. My bag left with Virgin Atlantic. I missed my flight by 15 minutes. Got booked for the next flight which would have me landing in San Jose 90 minutes later than planned, and in economy. So now I have to call Virgin Atlantic for a refund of some sort and see if I can get my bottle of champagne refunded too. Now, my mind was rapidly sensitised to the mediocrity around me in that airport. When I got the boarding pass for the next flight, the agent told me to head to the gate. Finding the gate was a maze of a walk and a transit train too. When I got to the gate- I noticed the boarding pass did not have a seat number. Yeah, I had to think fast and speak to the air hostess at the counter; they had to reprint a new boarding pass! The agent did not even tell me about this. Jeez- the staff are so laid back it’s borderline unprofessional and quite frankly incompetent and inconsiderate at the barest minimum. In conclusion, if you must go through Seattle, have a layover of 4 hours at least- otherwise avoid it like the plague. This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth. First world country my third world behind.",-1
2024-01-04,0.1,Business,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,all showed no concerns,True,"  While waiting for our flight we noticed a bag that was by a table across from us that had been left unattended for about 40 minutes. Both my husband and I reported the unattended bag to four different United staff employees and even alerted a restaurant employee, all showed no concerns and not one person called a security person to check on the unattended bag. For all I know the bag is still sitting at gate A11. Just glad that nothing bad happened this time because as we all know TSA never misses anything in there screening process.",-1
2023-12-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,,3.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,change to a ‘Bags first’ airport is a disaster,False,"  The change to a ‘Bags first’ airport is a disaster for any non-US citizen arriving on an international flight who hasn’t the benefit of pre-clearance at their point of departure. I arrived on the 22nd December and it took me over 2 hours from disembarking to getting outside to where a friend was collecting me. There was no obvious help for the elderly- it’s quite a trek to the escalator where you descend into the baggage hall. There was no help for anyone trying to make a connecting flight- I would never recommend that you book a connecting flight within 4 hours of arriving, and would suggest leaving it until the following day to be on the safe side. And you would have thought that at Christmas where there is a known spike in the number of people travelling that there would be more booths manned by Immigration Officials- but no that was not the case. And to have to listen to the never-ending message over the tannoy welcoming us to Seattle, was like adding insult to injury. I flew with Icelandair which I would thoroughly recommend, but for the future I’ll be flying Aer Lingus as I can pre-clear in Dublin, as I simply will not put myself through that endurance test again. It was shocking. In this day and age there must surely be a better and quicker way to screen international arrivals at SeaTac. If I had the chance I would award the Airport a Zero.",-1
2023-10-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,,wasteland of an airport,False, I have flown to or thru every major US. Airports and a handful of foreign ones. SeaTac is in the top 3 worst airports. It does not handle large amounts of passengers well. It is not laid out for easy transition from ticketing to boarding. TSA screening areas are a joke. It took 45 minutes to get thru that process. They barely can handle 100 passengers not a thousand. The satellite rental car location is at least 10 minutes shuttle ride to terminal. Suggest allowing extra time to navigate thru this wasteland of an airport.,-1
2023-09-03,0.5,Family Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,signage needs to improve,True,"  We arrive at Sea Tac via Sound Transit bus. When one enters the terminal, at the ground level, it's not clear where to go! There is an elevator to take you to check in. Check in at American has always been good at Sea Tac. The Security lines are confusing,  very poor communication and signage at the security lines. TSA employee on 8-14-23,  around 6 pm. He started yelling at I guess other employees but it sounded as if a fight was breaking out. That's unacceptable. I like the restaurants and so on. The signage at the airport needs to improve as well as the security lines.",1
2023-09-02,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,No reason to treat people like this,False,  Departing this airport encountered the most rude employees. From TSA agents slinging insults at us about us not seeing open lines to just down right rude people. No reason to treat people like this. There are some unhappy people working in that terminal. Seemed to be so unorganized also. The floors in the terminal area were nasty and needed to be vacuumed. I took my shoes off because we had such a long wait and that’s when I realized how nasty the carpets were.,-1
2023-08-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,definitely use a major upgrade,True," Traffic at this airport has increased substantially over the past few years and the departure gates are often crowded and chaotic, with no place to sit. The terminals can definitely use a major upgrade. As a vegetarian, I was dismayed at the limited food choices. For an airport this large, there were not many places to eat, and prices were high (menus posted outside the eateries didn't list prices). Meat-free selections were few. I was lucky to find a SUBWAY in Terminal C (my flight left from Terminal D) and managed to enjoy a simple sandwich at a reasonable price.",-1
2023-08-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,queue that took 2 hours,False, Quite possibly the worst airport experience I’ve ever had. Customs was a queue that took 2 hours because there weren’t enough officers to go through 6 international flights that landed at the same time. Poorly marked and attendants were incredibly unhelpful. To call it an airport would be far too generous and I wish I could give 0 stars.,-1
2023-08-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,line at the airport is enormous,False," The waiting line at the airport is enormous, we have been waiting more than 30 minutes, even though the waiting time was supposed to be a lot shorter. The crew at the security was very unhelpful, the first time my bags went though scan, they didn’t even take the picture - I had to wait in line again, took me 10 more minutes and arrived to the gate late, even though I came to airport early enough. Also, the floor was incredibly dirty everywhere I went",-1
2023-07-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Longest security lines,False," Longest security lines I have ever seen. Most of the security staff was incredibly rude. I missed my flight due to the long security line, despite arriving about two hours prior to my flight. Crowded, hot, and stressful airport. I knew my flight was boarding, so I was trying to get through as fast as I could. This is after waiting nearly 1.5 hours in line. The woman in front was me left a huge gap in front of her in the baggage scanning line and was very leisurely putting stuff in the tray. I still didn't break any rules, and just reached *behind her, not encumbering her in any way, and the security guy yelled at me. No need for him to yell “HEY, she s not done.” I understand people are overworked and stressed, but there’s no reason to lose common decency, especially to people who are being polite and following rules. Don’t even know the words please or thank you. They act like prison guards. Hope I never have to go back to that hell hole. Rudest staff I have ever experienced at any airport around the world.",-1
2023-07-26,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,very overcrowded security lines,False,  Grossly inefficient TSA queues and incompetent ground crew. We spent over 90 minutes in very overcrowded security lines. We spent over an hour on our plane waiting to pull away from the terminal due to ground equipment operator error. Seattle Airport needs a redesign to accommodate evolving security needs. Ground crew needs to be better trained on their equipment.,-1
2023-07-23,0.6,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,massively overcrowded,False," It was massively overcrowded, lines for security were routed through massive crowds of people without good guidance, completely disorganized, signage for security was poorly placed and labeled.

2023-07-20,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,Horrible layout and design,True,"  I will avoid this airport at all costs and suggest you all do the same. Horrible layout and design. Terrible signage and way-finding and not a single employee or person around to ask questions. 2 hour wait in security check, 45 minute wait for self tagged baggage check. 1 person working baggage check-in. 12 security lines available - but only 4 of them up and running. Worst airport experience I’ve had in 5 years",-1
2023-07-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,horrible customer service,False,"  We were at Sea-Tac yesterday. I have honestly never hated an airport experience more; and we've had some doozies. There was a lot wrong, but I don't need to re-live the entire experience. (Shudder.) Just know that the TSA experience was absolutely grueling. To a person, each of the four or five agents we encountered as we moved through the horrific 45 minute experience was rude. They ranged from basically non-verbal with curt nodding to a woman who literally screamed at people. She spoke so rapidly no-one could understand her and when no one hopped to get the bag she was holding she screamed again She scolded customers -- some who did not speak English and had no idea what they'd done ""wrong."" I saw her slap a man's hand away when he went to retrieve his name. A supervisor was looking over her shoulder for a while and he looked angry. But he DID nothing. They were busy and probably stressed and overworked and must have decided passengers should suffer as well. That's one way they were successful. Everyone walked away shaking their head. Horrible, horrible customer service. Sometimes people can't choose which airport they must use. I just hope consumers understand this will be a horrible experience OR that perhaps someone who works there.",-1
2023-07-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,1.0,Long lines and very disorganized,False,"  We had no problems at all arriving to the airport. The departure was a mess. Long lines and very disorganized. We pay for Clear and TSA Pre and I still got pulled out of line for the special screening which ok fine, I get that it’s random but so far this year I have been chosen on 3 out of my 4 flights. They make me and then 4 or 5 other random people wait for a good 5-10 minutes before anyone came to scan us. Why are you pulling people out of line to scan if no one is there to do it? I asked when someone was coming and was told they’ll get here when they get here. My husband told 2 women who were working behind the scanners that I needed my cane while I was standing there waiting and one rolled his eyes at him and then they both walked away. Never have we experienced such rude behavior at an airport and my husband has well over a million miles with Delta. To treat customers that way, especially someone with special needs is shameful.",-1

I hr of zig-zagging and if you leave a comb in your pocket you are pulled for full body scan. Arrival (Alaska) will require a mile-long, mile-high up-n-down hike to find your baggage carousel. Then you get to zig-zag for an hour or more (on a Mon nite!) queuing for Passport Control. Now these guys are terrific. Overall rating is 0 for SEA. Customs rating is 10. TSA is 1.",-1

2023-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,5.0,1.0,Security line looked like a stirred up mess,True,"  Arrived two and a half hours prior to our flight, which was already pre processed by our cruise company, luggage done and forwarded, boarding passes given to us on board - all we had to do was arrive at the airport for an internal flight to Los Angeles, go through security and board our flight. What an absolute joke! Security line looked like a stirred up mess, but the board did say 35 mins to go through, so we didn’t really panic at that time. After trailing up, then down, then up and down, then across the bottom of a long rectangle, we thought, one more up and we’ll be at the security desk, were we heck as like - we had another three up and down and then a half line up again (the half because of a big pillar - which explained why the original up and down lines then crossed over the bottom). By this time we were around 30 minutes off our flight and we still had to go through the security checks and scanner (downright bloody lie that the board was still saying 35 mins to security - nearer 3 hours). Staff were not helpful at all except every now and then they’d barge someone to the front of the queue - for no apparent reason, either they had clearance of some sort and should have been in a different queue or their face fitted ! but it was so infuriating to watch. Any mention of missing flights due to the queues was met with selective deafness or a shrug of the shoulders. When we finally got through the scanning I asked a member of staff where our gate was and he flew his hands in the air and said “follow the signs”. Now being very close to close of boarding, even knowing which direction to look would have been helpful. Turns out following the directions was not the quickest way - there was a tram downstairs which would have saved us quite a hike. Never seen so many people running for gates in my life - obviously in the same boat as us. Our family, who live in LA, had TSA clearance and got through in about 10 minutes - I’m sure you can imagine the text messages passing between us. When we fly through Edinburgh/ London/ Manchester etc I see a pretty decent distribution of staff welcoming visitors worldwide as well as nationals with all people treated with respect. Seattle airport seemed to have an emphasis on nationals or TSA approved and very few staff attending to the general boarding line. (Most of the security screens were closed) We made our flight with minutes to spare, no time to pick up some water or a bite to eat on the plane. There were empty seats on out flight which our family found rather odd as the flight was full with a list of stand by passengers - guess those poor guys were still in the magic roundabout they call a security line - which is definitely a roundabout but there no magic in it. I will never use this airport again, which is a shame, because we had a rather nice week in Seattle before our cruise and would have considered a revisit - not going to happen I’m afraid. I have had to rate 1/10 because it won’t let me do zero and I can’t comment on airport facilities- didn’t see them as I was trying to get through to the gate before we lost our seat!",-1

We arrived two hours before our flight and after check-in it took over an hour and a half to get through security line. The place is very unorganized. Horrible, horrible experience. Will never fly out of this airport again.",-1

2023-04-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Very negative experience,False," Seattle airport is so bad! It took us 2.5 hours to wait and pass the security line. Of course, we missed our flight. Many passengers missed flights because of the ridiculous long waiting time! The airport staff did not care at all! It's common for them. We were forced to leave the airport and spent the night at a hotel and wasted the second full day waiting at the airport again. Can not say enough how bad the Seattle airport is! Very negative experience to Seattle! Will not come to Seattle again!",-1

Today the machine is broken for 15 minutes and hold up the line for 30 min. Get a simpler (less expensive) system like San Jose airport.,-1
2023-03-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,4.0,,bad aspects to the design,True,"  I lived in Seattle in the past, and the airport was always small but decently serviceable, but due for an upgrade. My husband and I returned from a trip to England last week and our experience going through the touted ""brand new international arrivals terminal"" was mostly awful. It took us about an hour, and that isn't the most unreasonable amount of time, but there were some really glaringly bad aspects to the design of the place and some of their protocols that will steer me away from every flying through SeaTac again. I will say the luggage retrieval/customs/passport control/baggage redrop section was fast and efficient.  From getting off the plane and to pick up your luggage, the walk is hard to measure. I know that walked 1500 steps, about 1/4 - 1/3 mile (guesstimating based on my known ~2200 steps/mile) and it's difficult to measure the distance on a map, but it was a solid 3/4 of a mile by the time we got through the whole maze to the main terminal. There were no moving sidewalks at all, and the escalator to the top of the bridge (which allows passage of airplanes) was long and slow, as was the one on the other side. I walked down the steps and beat my husband to the bottom. After baggage/passport/customs, if you have a transfer or connecting flight, you have to get TSA'd again, full security screening, even though we hadn't even entered the main terminal yet... we were still effectively behind security. Additionally, the line was long and they only had 1 screening lane open, but did eventually open 2. This fancy new facility is not disability friendly, I'm lucky that I can walk the distances required. It just has a feel of being sparkly and over-engineered. Also, there didn't appear to be any thought for the end user in their design process.",-1
2023-03-19,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,where things became abysmal,True,"  We arrived from Mexico. Customs was well organized and even though there were many people it went quickly. We then had to re-check our baggage which was also quick because someone pushed us through and then took us to security where they put us in the ""quick"" TSA line because they knew we had to catch a connecting flight. This is where things became abysmal. There was only one person screening IDs for everyone regardless of which line you were in. This was at 10pm. Then after that there were only 2 lanes open to screen carry-ons and people. Many people missed their flights. I ran to mine and caught it, but my daughter missed her flight. I live in AK and we have more people manning security late at night than Seattle. Not sure what their thought process is? Bottom line, get their super early. We had two hours and it was not enough time.",-1
2023-03-03,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,a place to avoid if you can,False,"  I flew into Seattle on a BA flight in order to get to Reno for some skiing with the family. Already aware of its reputation I tried valiantly to avoid, alas our original ticket LAX was canceled due to a late departure so we were re-routed through SeaTac. Its reputation did it justice. An underwhelming airport. Dark dirty and poorly signed. A long walk to get to cpb checkpoints and first you collect your bags. Whoever thought out that idea should be keel hauled for gross stupidity. The cbp agent was ok we were through in a few minutes and then a five-minute walk to transfer our bags. It's a hell of a long walk from one terminal to the other, you ride a very small single pod between gates assuming you can figure it out and then a long long long walk through its dirty, dark and soulless corridors up and down escalators. Employees seem to delight in its claustrophobic dirty design and like a dog and its master reflecting its personality. For sure a place to avoid if you can.",-1
2023-01-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,long walk without moving sidewalk,False,"  Many nice shops, but I don’t go to the airport to shop. Delta arrival gate involves a long walk without moving sidewalk to baggage claim. Rental car is shuttle is at the absolute end of the terminal. Bus to rental facility which has no helpful signage. On return the shuttle drops you outside of the very end on the baggage return. Up multiple stairs. Again walk the length of the terminal. If you go outside there you can find a Delta skycap. Zero consideration for passenger convenience. One of the worst I’ve experienced.",-1
2023-01-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,spot saver option is quick,True,"  I give Seattle airport a five star. The spot saver option is quick, available to anyone, and puts you in a short and easy line for easy security. Curbside check-in for Delta was amazing since I broke my wrist in the ice storm. And the biggest surprise was the TSA agents who tried to connect briefly with every passenger in some kind way and wished me well in my recovery, and offered assistance as needed. I love the original and interesting retail that is also available. Only disappointment was that I couldn’t find a bottle refill station that was in order. Thanks, Seattle.",1
2022-12-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2 hour wait to get though security,False,"  Worst airport. 2 hour wait to get though security! I have been through many airports and have never had this kind of delay. We realize that a major upgrade would cost millions, but maybe some of the outrageous overpricing for parking, food and drink, airline tickets and transportation could be allocated to a couple more security checkpoints?",-1
2022-11-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,he most poorly managed airport,False,  Quite possibly the most poorly managed airport I've ever experienced. We moved the the area and need to deal with the airport frequently now. Every single time it's a complete disaster trying to get to and into the terminals. It's simply line after line. Without TSA Precheck and clear we'd have to show up 5 hours early for even a chance to make departing flights.,-1
2022-10-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,TSA officers are unnecessarily rude,False,"  The airport and staff are ok. However, TSA officers are unnecessarily rude even to the point of being obnoxious.  They were even arguing amongst themselves in front of children and the elderly. This is a real concern. In any other industry, employees would be fired if they spoke to their customers as they did.",-1
2022-10-16,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,too much construction at one time,False,"  This airport has too much construction at one time. The airport hasn't been updated in a long time. It needs it. It is also very annoying to look for a decent food place and half of them say ""they are coming soon."" No plug in work in D1. The place appears just nasty.",-1

2022-10-04,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,"a sense of crowding"" ",True,"  The airport is under construction (it has often been under construction) at the central food court section. There is a sense of crowding as the airport is now receiving more flights than ever before whether C or N terminal. The TSA has to check my body because I wear a medical device, but the female TSA twice were feeling right near my crotch as if they could not restrain themselves from trying to feel up there as high up my thigh as they could. My device is on my stomach, so there is no need to do a full feel over like that; no other airport did. Only this one at Sea-Tac, twice, because they also made me check in an extra carry-on-luggage. There is nothing you can do about appearance-fixated people except ignore them. If you say, ""mind your own business,"" they start shouting at you! I could have said ""mind your own business"" a few more times, but this spacy appearance-fixated gal simply would not let go. So just move away and Gosh help you that you don't encounter having to sit near these people or have them start their programmed-for-trouble staring. As these types of people cannot understand tactfulness nor honor personal boundaries. Finally as I said, the queus at the airport are so long that the plane took extra time to coast up to the ramp, both times landing.",1
2022-09-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,the worst experience,False,"  Seattle-SeaTac was the worst experience, after hiking a long way the passport control person made people wait in line forever with no reason to even get in line for passport control. We have Global Entry which is like TSA pre check for international flights & the line took forever with only 2 agents. Then we had to wait in the security line again for ever & the TSA women had to check my knee brace 5 times, what a witch. Needless to say we missed our connection to PDX. What is wrong with the management in Seattle? We travel a lot & it was terrible avoid if at all possible. Plus only was place to eat open at Wendy’s employees didn’t have time to eat their food.",-1

Waiting time to security was over 1 hour. 5 security stations open for thousands of passengers and several others closed. Signing at the airport once you have checked your bag is almost not existing and the signing present is misguiding and full of flaws.

2022-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,never again would we use Sea Tac,False,"  Who ever designed this airport needs to have their head examined. We arrived on an International flight. First you have to walk miles on multiple sky bridges just to get to baggage and customs/immigration. The baggage area took up most of the area. There wasn't any permanent lines set up for entering customs/immigration. Some portable lines set up on the right side of the building weaving back and forth, three deep. The end of the line went back to the stairs where you enter the area and then weaved around the different baggage claim/luggage pickup spots. Very confusing and unorganized. The only way you knew where the end of the line was there was a guy with a sign saying END OF THE LINE. Some really rude employees. I asked about passengers with short connections and was told ""We don't do short connections"" It took us 45-1 hr. just to get thru the first winding rope area to finally get to go get in line at the customs/immigration. Then off in a mad rush to get to our gate. First have to go thru security again, another 30 minutes in line. At this point we got to meet the rudest airport security person ever. He was yelling at passengers, barking orders and being verbally abusive. He was berating an elderly woman who was having problems when my husband spoke up and called him out saying, ""You don't have to talk to people like that"" We barely made it to our gate in time only to be told that the flight had been delayed. My husband and I swore never again would we use Sea Tac for an International arrival. The day after we got home we changed an up coming trip thru Sea Tac to a different airport.",-1

The delays, long lines and inefficiencies here are very discouraging. The entire place is a pig-pen, looking like there is no janitorial service at all. The floor is littered with debris, trash is left in the seats and the bathrooms are nasty. We have had many around us as we wait comment on how nasty the whole place is. This is not something that just happened today. This filth on the floor has been here for a while. Disgusting. I will avoid this airport on future travels if at all possible. I understand this airport was nice in years past, but has been deteriorating in the last few years.",-1

Service is horrible, security and employees are so rude and annoyed when you ask a question. Security told me the wrong direction for luggage scanning then blamed it on us, and we lost our spots in the line. If you’re struggling or English is not your first language, have a lot of questions don’t expect to get the help you need. Either you go very early to your aisle to get your seats or you will have to find somewhere to sit on the floor.",-1
2022-06-27,0.4,Business,2.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,,"Seatac airport has changed, for the worse",True,"  This used to be my favourite airport, a short commuter flight from my home in Victoria, then a quick walk through customs and immigration using my mobile passport app, then on the terminal train to the gate. No fuss, no hassle, very little waiting, if any. It was a very efficient and well laid out airport. Now, two years later and after Covid, flights have been restored from my home city, but Seatac airport has changed, for the worse. In an effort to increase capacity of passport control, I now have to walk an uncomfortable distance from the plane to the passport control and baggage claim, and then enter a very long line-up of travellers to see an agent. Mobile passport, the version issued by the US Government, is not accepted here, the special lines for US and Canadian citizens are not being used, and if I'd had a tight connection, I would have certainly missed it. And with all the walking, it is clear that the designer did not consider older people. I don't know if I'm coming back this way, now, My recent experience was an unpleasant an trying one, at an airport I formerly considered to be the most efficient airport I had ever experienced. What were they thinking?",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Business,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,Everything is dirty to filthy,False,"  I've been to SeaTac twice in the past week. It's a dump. Everything is dirty to filthy. Every horizontal surface needed cleaning. The restrooms are not just unclean, they rival an outhouse experience. An outhouse used by thousands of people daily. The seats are frayed and worn and literally lining the walls of the concourse where people walk by towing their luggage past your feet. The food choices remind me of a high school cafeteria ignored by the school board, overpriced and barely edible. The offerings make highway fast food seem like a gourmet alternative. What happened Seattle?",-1

It appears that floors, seats, tables - anything where humans must exist - have not been cleaned in months! Trash is everywhere. I would be reluctant to eat or drink anything in this airport because I would question its suitability for human consumption. Certainly there is no place to safely eat anything. Very sad.",-1

Carpeting in gate areas are filthy. The bathrooms stunk and were dirty. No good water bottle refill stations and the one I found had backed up sitting water in it that stunk and was filthy.

2022-01-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,isn't worth the hassle,False," Seatac has been sliding in a downward spiral for the last few years. First with their incompetent handling and management of construction/expansion that caused delays, missed flights and other problems affecting passengers from all airlines operating out of there. There has been no improvement and the construction is just dragging on now for years with little benefit seen from it. Now, the airport received a light dusting of snow that closed it down numerous times over the Christmas holidays. Canceled flights, delays compounding an already busy system, stranded passengers were the norm and it affected flights from all across the nation. But Seatac has it's cute little food delivery robots getting in passengers ways. How much did that total waste cost? Maybe if that money had been spent on a few more pieces of snow removal equipment the airport could have remained functioning. While it is not often that Seattle gets snow, it does happen regularly, even with global warming. Who ever is in charge of the airport is a total buffoon and incompetent and must be a pay back room appointee. Get someone that knows how to run a large, complicated airport system and not just some lackey looking for the splash of doing the current ""cool"" thing. I am seriously considering moving my allegiance to a different Airport, like Spokane, and if need be will be changing airlines as well. Seatac is not convenient for me at all and with all of these constant problems, it just isn't worth the hassle. I'll take my dollars elsewhere.",-1

2021-09-19,0.4,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,Seattle seems to be a little improved,True," Seattle seems to be a little improved from three years ago, but still not great. Their N concourse has been beautifully redone, and is very modern, though the restroom wasn't very clean. Their B and C concourses, though, are still relics of the 1980s, old, cramped, vastly outdated, and with disgusting restrooms. The dining and bar options were/are plentiful, although overcrowded and overpriced even by standards of major hubs. The inter-concourse tram is nice and efficient. Customer service is about like I remember it, whether while dining in or at the boarding gate: courteous and polite, but kind of detached and aloof. I've never met any personnel in this airport who were either outright rude or outright bubbly, I guess that's just the Seattle way. Alaska and Delta have nice lounges there, and, again, the N concourse is nicely redone, so there is some incentive to transit through there more often in the future, but the airport still has a lot to be desired yet in terms of overall customer experience. If you're vacationing in the Pacific NW, I still recommend flying into Portland, Bellingham, or Vancouver, BC if you can help it.",-1

Venture to the rotunda and same, the airport is shutting down while 100s of travelers are awaiting flights. Availability was already limited due to the port awarding contracts to new ventures and booting about long term airport tenants.

Halls narrow. Poor signage. Arrived international. Jet bridge didn’t work. Pulled aircraft to another jet bridge, 30 min delay. Staff at bag transit were aloof looking at cell phones and chatting.

I accidentally left my pepper spray on my keychain (I’m a 24-year-old woman who takes self defense seriously) and she picked it up out of my bin and aggressively said, “what is this? You can’t take this. What were you thinking?” In front of everyone in the security area. I couldn’t believe the condescending tone she had.

I just came thru this week on round trip from BIL to DCA and back. Airport is same as I remember. Very crowded, fairly dirty and seems about 50 years out of date. Some of the terminals are so crowded that the air exchange cannot be close to good. Compared to Vancouver, Canada, DEN, Hong Kong, ABQ, etc it is pretty sad.

Then we had to walk the length of the terminal to get in line for security, which began out in the parking lot and wound around (for at least a half hour) and up some stairs into the building. We didn't get through security until 9.10. Our boarding pass (which we received that morning) listed the wrong gate, but since we were in a rush, we didn't stop to check it. By the time we reached the correct gate, at 9.20, we were told the doors had been closed and we missed the flight. Then we had to wait another half hour in line to get the next available flight, which was an unwelcome red-eye leaving at 9.45 pm, and our checked bag is at the wrong airport.

Seattle being such a “tech” city with so much money, one would think they could figure out how to plan a better airport. Recent multi-million dollar remodels didn’t help ...in fact I think they made it worse. Who came up with the idea to have to public transport’s last stop still be a 30 min trek to the check in counter? Is that the same person who decided to put the rental car return 2 elevators, a bus ride, and 3 escalators from the checkin desks? (Around 20 mins)  No alcohol during Covid?

Was forced to navigate across the airport (3 gates) to check by bag, and then was informed when I arrived at the gate (5 minutes before departure) that they had preemptively closed the gates 15 minutes. Didn't receive the memo. Make sure you show up at least 15 minutes prior to your scheduled departure or you may not be allowed on the plane.

I even asked an employee of the airport to enforce the rules and ask a man close to me to put on a mask and she told me it wasn’t her job and walked away. I am disgusted with how filthy the airport is. People leave their trash all over and have no respect for others around them.

At least half the people were not  wearing masks - including airport personnel. There was no social distancing, and, the airport was crowded. I thought that flying in mid-May would be safer than waiting till more people flew, especially since I heard that airports and most airlines were requiring masks (if not social distancing). Only in the USA would there be no real safety regulations in place. For shame airport. Alaska Airlines was worse/as bad. They 'boasted' about their safety policy in place but it was a farce. They said masks were required but there was absolutely no enforcement, even when I complained. I hope to never fly through this airport or with this airline again. It would have been a relief if they had followed their words with real actions, but obviously they are afraid of passengers (who I agree must be not quite right to not fly with a mask), and obviously the company policy does not back them up.",-1

I’m so annoyed and wish my airline didn’t constantly use this terminal. It’s cleaner than most, but the lack of amenities and closure of all services at this terminal by 10pm is unreal. We arrived after a 6 hour flight to find all kitchens and quick food in this terminal closed. Even the newsstand, closes at 10. There isn’t a single thing open and after 6 hours, one might like to grab a quick bite or drink or heck, even buy a new magazine. Zero options tonight. Super unfortunate and super frustrating.

After multiple arrivals into and departures from Seattle, all I have to say is, ""What a joke!"" How, oh how, does the metropolis which gave the world Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, and served as the setting for the classy '90s sitcom ""Frasier,"" manage to have an airport that would shame Satan himself? It's almost as bad as LAX. Staff aren't so much rude, as they are ""aggressively passive-aggressive"" - pushy and aloof, but polite the whole time they're doing it. The passengers indeed can actually seem rather hostile, perhaps because they're crammed like sardines in an old, outdated, small, dingy, filthy airport that always seems to be under construction without any tangible progress in modernization. There is no logical connectivity between the terminals, whether you're relying on signage or the inter-terminal tram. I mean, isn't the purpose of a tram to logically piece the airport together? The floors don't look like they've been cleaned since 1987. The restrooms, unkempt sometimes. Delays in arriving to, and departing from, the gate are common, because this airport has had a dramatic spike in flights without any accompanying increase in people-handling and gate capacities. If you have to visit the Pacific Northwest, fly into Portland, OR or Bellingham, WA in the US, or Victoria, BC or Vancouver, BC in Canada (though Canadian immigration and customs aren't exactly any more pleasant than their American counterparts).",-1

Added to this is the fact that all the store employees seem to be bothered when you have to interupt their conversations. If you have a connecting flight I recommend you avoid Tacoma Airport.",-1
2020-01-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,a poor experience every time,True," The slowest and most inefficient airport I've ever had to arrive at. If you are not a US citizen, do not, I repeat, do not make a transit at this airport, you will not make it in time. Of the 6 times, I've arrived here internationally, it took an average of 1.5 hours just to clear the immigration checkpoint each time, with a maximum of 3 hours from personal experience. After clearing customs, all other airports that I've been to have your checked luggage up and out on the carousel in 20 minutes max. Here, it's at least an hour's wait so it doesn't even matter if you've cleared the immigration checkpoint quickly. Finally when you exit to ground transport, do not use the bag conveyor belt to deliver your luggage separately before taking the transit train to Seattle exit and ground transportation else you'll have to wait another 10 minutes for your bags to arrive by the conveyor belt after you've arrived by the transit train. This airport is not just understaffed, it suffers from very visible underemployment and operation inefficiencies. For example, the airport management has in their infinite wisdom decided to station not one but two workers at each luggage carousel to arrange bags neatly on the carousel as they arrive by the conveyor belt so that they don't tip over. This task is absolutely pointless - I've still seen bags tip over and being rearranged by other passengers standing beside it. So now you have two persons being paid to just stand by the carousel chit-chatting and occasionally moving a bag or two when they could be doing something more useful like delivering the bags quickly. All in all, too much waiting and a poor experience every single time. Is it too much to ask for an airport to do its job quickly so I don't have to stand for another 3 hours after a 12-hour transpacific flight? I've arrived in the US from LA and San Fran and both are much, much faster.",-1

My wife has PreCheck and has to walkway down from the rest of the security and it took her three times as long to clear bag check/body scan as I did without PreCheck. We walked down to the gate and I was shocked at the dirty carpets. All kinds of food debris are on the floor, all over. There is no one cleaning or vacuuming and it is late afternoon. My wife dropped her coat on the floor and I was grossed out. We moved to the other side of the building to wait at Gate B9 vs Gate B10. Otherwise, the experience was uneventful. Nice sunset with a good view of the mountains. Then I got my bag in San Diego and someone has been through it. It is not a TSA inspection. One side has been ransacked. The strap I always put around the bag is gone and the stupid expanding section is now bellowed out. Inside the contents are as if they were tossed in a blender. What a mess. I don't know who or why but this is really bad news. SWA runs a great organization and I doubt they were the source of something nefarious. But it happened there and could not have happened on arrival because it came out with everyone elses. Who does that? How cheesey and lame.

No more. SeaTac is without question the worst customs/immigration experience in the first world. There were easily a thousand arrival passengers and only 6 immigration agents. There was a queue to get into the queue to use the passport scanners, and then a further queue to get to an agent. The queues were “managed” by college sophomores who were all on their first week on the job. The offered no explanation as to why the delays were so extensive, and basically told the queues to shut up and endure it. It took 3 hours from the time we got in line to the 15-second interview with the immigration agent. I will never, repeat, never book an international arrival to Seattle.",-1

There are many well run airports in the country. SeaTac is not one of them. The busing to planes is a disaster. A timely departure is rare.

We were arriving from a very long flight with two small children and everything about that fact is just plain awful. There is a short walk to immigration, probably the only plus, and then the confusion begins. They won't have your stroller yet so you carry all of your luggage and small children. There is no family friendly or child friendly service. You wait in very long lines with very poor line management, changing the configuration willy nilly at will and people in the back of the line might be first ones through kind of deal. Then because their long lines are so terrible with poor customer service and direction usually your bags are out on baggage claim. Used to have to wait for that for hours but they've fixed that problem by delaying you elsewhere. Then our bag is lost and nobody knows where it is or really helps in any way. There is no convenient counter to offer assistance. Every person working there is like a free agent, not connected to the larger web. Then you wait in another line to get through baggage and when you voluntarily have one item checked out by animal control they rudely handle your stuff.  Then when you finally find someone at a baggage counter and say 'hello' they don't bother looking up from their phone to say hi back and then are just so not helpful that you decide to run screaming out of this whole place and try your luck on the phone later because humans are incompetent. Lastly forget public transportation, this is also a joke. You now have to walk like a mile to the light rail without the stroller the airport lost and then get harassed by ticket enforcement for good measure.

When your pilot wishes everyone the best of luck on arrival you know you have problems. We landed at 1:15 p.m. from Heathrow and did not get out until 4 o'clock. By that time our pick-up had left and we had to pay again. Some people had to cradle their small children for a long time as there was very little seating. I would suggest anyone thinking of arriving here on an international flight should break their journey and go through immigration, etc somewhere else and then travel on a domestic flight. We had trouble finding our bags and the airport staff, if you could find one, were unhelpful. Immigration staff were pleasant",-1

No signs, no station announcement and no hint of where your airline might be. Instructions on how to navigate through the airport were more complicated than my SAT exam.

None of the employees have the foggiest idea what is going on and are exceptionally rude. They clearly do not care at all about their customers or their jobs. This airport is a hot mess.

I have been in airports around the world and I can now say with confidence that SeaTac is the most poorly managed airport that I visit. I now have to account for an extra half hour (minimum) delay for both arrivals and departures. I understand growth of an area creates difficulties, but the area has experienced continuous, foreseeable growth for decades. The inability to accommodate this growth at the airport is a clear sign of poor management and this should be addressed. Top down changes are needed. Anyone in a leadership role who believes that this airport is on the right path, as busses drive people to planes, departures are delayed due to runway availability, and arrivals sit and wait for gates to open, needs to be fired and replaced by someone with a realistic view of the problems facing the airport. Solutions are needed and no new restaurant or international terminal will rectify the disaster that has become SeaTac airport.",-1

The kiosks did not print out luggage tags. This caused a long process of waiting in line to have the tags printed. Security was another nightmare, going from one security area to another depending on your gate (What? Why?).

I have traveled to most states, and all the airports have their quirks, but this one annoyed me and that is hard to do when I am on vacation. I am not going to complain about things they have no control over like TSA lines or airline queues though their queue lines for taking passengers to the Rental Car Station was 100 yards long. I am going to complain about an unsafe practice that is directly caused by airport management. The use of buses to take passengers to their planes is something I have seen before and understand. However, filling the buses with passengers like sardines with carry on luggage is a recipe for disaster. I complained to the workers and they kept pushing people in. As I expected, the bus had to come to a hard stop (normally I would not have considered the stop as bad), and everyone wound up bumping into each other and tripping over luggage. No one was hurt but this is an accident waiting to happen. They had four buses queued up and it was unnecessary to unsafely pack this many people just because they think this is a subway car or a street bus. I choose to be on those and subject myself to that when necessary but not at an airport with carry on luggage. The other disappointing feature of the airport is its dinginess. The outside areas where you wait are poorly maintained with debris all over along with dirty walls and sidewalks. Not what I have come to expect from a US airport. I know its next to impossible to choose your airport but stay away from this one if you can until they make things safer and clean up their public areas.",-1

Arriving back to the same airport two weeks later, the baggage took a very long time to reach the baggage claim area. There is a totally inadequate pet relief area with a small bit of gravel, no grass. For smokers one goes outside the terminal at the baggage claim area, it is filthy and there is no cover which must be awful in the winter when it rains a lot in Seattle.

Only a few check in monitors working causing approx. 1 hour lines. The dust and trash that cover the security floors is beyond sickening. The gate seats are sticky, dirty and full of trash, one even had a orange peel on the ground and no employee cared to pick it up. The bathrooms are worse than public street porta potties. This airport doesn’t reflect the city of Seattle. I am so turned off by this airport I will most likely never return.",-1

There’s absolutely no reason on a non-holiday Monday afternoon to have a 1.5 hour wait in security. The airport knows how many flights and people to expect, and they should hire enough people to facilitate people getting through security in a reasonable time. Instead, there are very few staff around to help and direct (and the ones that are just blindly tell you to go to the next checkpoint because it’s “quicker,” when it’s not). The TSA agents are rude and defensive. One was giving me a dirty look and she said because I had given her one. Well, yes, I just waited in a 1.5 hour line for no reason, did she? She then went on that it’s my fault I was late (when I arrived almost 2 hours before my domestic flight). They also flag and pull lots of luggage from the line—but then there’s no one to check that flagged luggage and you have to wait another 10 minutes while your bags just sit there. I will avoid Seattle airport at all costs!",-1

I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people , most of whom complained to the staff on duty after an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide , with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes arrived and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine hour flight and ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own finger prints . Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints ? ….NO. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, the finger plate was dirty , greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted . So wondering what germs or micro biological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually I obtained a piece of paper with a large “X” across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again and being ordered to another queue about two and half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own finger printing machine that eventually, (although just as unclean as the previous one) agreed to read my finger tips ! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we all felt we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us in to the United States stated “We are getting new machinery soon”. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep. I assume that anybody who lives in Seattle or works there would also be disgusted if they saw how people visiting their city for the first time ever were treated.",-1

When we realized we were not going to make it on time (boarding time had started since 30 minutes), we asked a tsa agent to help us to cut the line. We were suprised of her negative answer as its usually how we do it in Europe. We were even more surprised when she asked us to wait while everyone was passing in front us, making us even later for our flight, in the future, we hope there will be some changes regarding the organization of the tsa security queue to reduce its duration.

We had an hour and a half to do all this - seems adequate, right? Wrong. After customs and baggage inspection (about 45 minutes), SEATAC required us to exit security, take a shuttle to another terminal, and go back through TSA screening again - about another 45 minutes because there were very few screeners working, and the line was unbelievable. All this to return to the same terminal we started at, only two gates over. We ran through the terminal and were late for boarding. The entire experience was stressful and completely unnecessary - why in the world does TSA want to create more work for themselves? They should simply keep arrivals behind security when they're meeting connecting flights.",-1

",False,"  The international arrival process is archaic compared to other airports, ie Frankfurt, Germany. The scanning machines are numerous and quick but then you still check through an agent who stamps your printed receipt which served no purpose other than being redundant. When we asked who gets the printed receipt an officer said to destroy it. Then after exiting with our baggage we went through another screening which had only two lines resulting in a large backup. The people helping with the baggage were friendly and helpful, the TSA individuals we had contact with were grumpy, especially some woman with the drug/fruit sniffing dog. Embarrassed to think that foreigners entering the US get a sterile, non-welcoming first impression.",-1

One of the see-thru boxes had been opened, the plastic seal removed along with two pieces of candy. Are you kidding me! Because the candy was in see-thru plastic containers it was totally unnecessary to open the box and remove the plastic seal. Crazy. Also, I had a bottle of liqueur padded with plastic on two sides and taped in place so the inspectors could clearly see the labels on the front/back of the bottle and see exactly what it was. They removed all the padding and didn’t bother to tape it back on after inspecting it. It’s a miracle it didn’t break and spill all over the contents of my suitcase. Why can’t they repack items the way they found them? This isn’t SeaTac’s fault, but some of the TSA people working there reflect poorly on an otherwise excellent airport.",1

We already did online check night before flight but needed to get a bag tag from a malfunctioned kiosk and waiting for one to open up. Then stand in a long line to check bags in. Although I was pre check I chose to go with the rest of my family who weren't. After that the craziness began. Among our group of 6 was my 91 yr old mother who maneuvered those very very long zig zag lines thru TSA as good as we did. There were only 2 lines to general tsa check for hundreds of people zig zagged sometimes 4 abreast. What I carried through TSA Honolulu and TSA Las Vegas in 3 pans took 6 pans at Seatac. The young agent had me put all my belongings in separate pans. Shoe, purse, hand carry, jacket and ipad/cell phone, 6 pans total not counting my mother's 3 pans with her hand carry, purse and cell phone. After we went through my mother's purse went missing and we panicked running around looking for it only to find that an agent had it and brought it to us to search. By the time we got the tram to the boarding gate with 7 minutes left to board I was happy to be leaving that nightmare experience behind. It took 1 hr and 10 minute thru TSA. Come on seatac we've been going thru this since 2001, get it together! You are the last people your visitors go through. Fix your TSA lines! Six of us almost missed our flight.",-1

They have 2 pre-check only security checkpoints right next to each other, fully staffed with officer with very little to do because they usually have just handful people in pre-check line. However, if you don’t have the pre-check, you have to walk long ways to the checkpoint in the middle of the airport, which has the line that wraps forever. It turns into a very stressful process because both the passengers and the officers are overwhelmed. Getting thru security may take you 40+ minutes. Unacceptable.

On arrival, I was shocked at how extremely long the immigration and customs queues were, staff were handing out bottles of water and many passengers were missing connecting flights. Announcements advertised an e-passport app but no WiFi on which to download the app until quite far into the queue, and no advertisement that there was WiFi. Overall, it took two hours to get through as a US citizen. After immigration (literally walking through, wondering if I was going to be arrested) I ended up confused and bewildered in Customs with people playing Human Snake around the baggage claim waiting for their turn, which took another hour. The way out was no better, with ridiculous security lines and a rush through screening that must be cutting corners. Seating before security also scarce and the cafes were crowded. Poor, retirement-age volunteers had been brought in to help queuing and give passenger info - a disgrace that they're not being paid. Come on SeaTac, get it together.

Staff at the line up area were pleasant and apologetic for the long wait. When I got to the officer, he was rude. It was a long wait for me and must be the same for him.

",True, Obviously the airport is undergoing modernisation as it is looking very tired at the moment. The staff were all very polite and helpful but that did not detract from the long 2 hour queue to get through immigration which was awful. Some people missed connections as there appeared to be no mechanism for fast tracking such passengers. Baggage was taken off the carousels long before people arrived to free up space for other flights. Then there was another queue for customs. Baggage back on a conveyor with no information as to where it would end up. Then long walk to find a taxi. At the end of a nine+ hour flight it was just too much.

",False,"  Wow SeaTac, get it together. I’m from Tampa, which is probably my favorite airport in the world. But I moved to Seattle some years ago, and now I’m experiencing probably the dirtiest, least efficient airport on a regular basis. Before even getting to the airport, traffic is backed up. This evening it was Arrivals traffic, but it was spilling over into the Departures lanes, so we were delayed there 15 mins. The people waiting to get to Arrivals must’ve had to wait over 30 mins to get there. They need to be better about moving people along and not letting them sit. The Security screening process is a joke, with lines going every direction and no designated person advising people how to prepare to go thru screening. The women’s bathroom was so dirty, with toilets clogged, paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor, overflowing garbage bins, soap dispensers that don’t work and if you notice the carpet at the terminal, it looks like it hasn’t been vacuumed in a week.

Customs, bag check and security take an incredibly long time to clear. The whole operation is crammed into the basement.

Without exaggerating, we can say that the campground outhouses in Japan are cleaner than the restrooms in Sea-Tac.

Not only is this airport ugly, but customer service is horrible and TSA lines are out of control. We arrived 2.5 hours prior to our flight to Las Vegas. At the airline counter we checked in and were told to wait in the TSA line which started right next to the airline counter! The line snaked around and around. It was moving so we thought the line would go quickly. We were mistaken. The lines snaked through almost every part of the terminal. Down hallways, next to shops, thru other lines, etc. I have never seen such poor management of TSA lines at any other airport in the US. It was simply mind boggling. I attempted to ask a TSA agent about the Pre-Check lines but was ignored. On my second try I was told to move or get pulled out of line. SeaTac is seriously a horrible airport. It's only redeeming quality is it's light rail system that connects directly to the airport and gets you to downtown Seattle easily. Other than that, SeaTac is a horrible mess.

The full body scanner had yellow tape on the front of it with no agent. So he yelled something like ""where is the full body person?"" then he yelled again as I am waiting then he said ""fine I will do it"" and I finally was able to make it though no problems. My wife was not Pre Check and she waited in line for about 30 minutes until she reached the screener. They had very few agents at that time in the morning. When she went though, the machine kept saying she had something in her pant pocket. The pants did not have a pocket so they did a very detailed examination. In the mean time the line was growing longer as a new group of agents were coming to work. It took my wife 45 minutes to make it though - very disappointed!",-1

They had a TSA precheck with no line and many agents doing nothing while the regular line was literally out the door. Totally inefficient.

They need to study other airports, much like Seattle itself there are major problems in planning.",-1
2018-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,security lines are totally ridiculous,True," Really a horrible airport. It is operating at capacity. The security lines are totally ridiculous all the time. Last time I was there (June 11) at least TSA was letting people through without taking off shoes, going through the x-ray, taking out computers or toiletries, etc. which was a nice change, but even with that the line took 30 minutes and stretched for probably 200 yards away from the security checkpoint (everyone would have missed their flights if TSA had done the normal checks.) For international arrivals, passport checks can also be very slow since there doesn't seem to be any correlation between the arrival times of flights and the number of immigration officers on duty. The international departure terminal can get very crowded and hot in the early afternoon, and it can be hard to find a place to sit and slow to get served if you want food. Soon at least we will have Paine Field as an alternative option.",-1

",False,"  Having flown several times in and out of SeaTac in the past few months I am increasingly dismayed by my hometown airport experience. Ridiculously long screening lines for those who have not paid for the honor of TSA precheck or other. Two hours to clear immigration. Huge line with no bathrooms available. This after 30 hours of travel from East Africa made this traveler indignant to say the least. They had just three officers at passport control. Come on, guys. We pay a ton of taxes. A better airport experience should be available to all.",-1

This by far one for the worst airports in the U.S. TSA has only one checkpoint open plus PreCheck. Oh yeah, and lots of passengers standing in line waiting for the rest of the TSA employees to start working. This is ridiculous. But hey who cares, the passengers only keep this business in the air, so why should they matter? Now I am sure someone will talk about 'shift changes' and the classic, we only care about passengers safety, blah, blah, blah, we all understand that but be efficient please, and for goodness sake smile once in a while and say ""Have a nice day "" with at least some sincerity.",-1

Took me 40 minutes to get to the front and when I asked why so few were open the TSA officer refused to answer my question and just told me to move along.

Seattle Airport is by far the worst TSA experience I’ve ever encountered. They are also not military friendly. Waiting in line is just ridiculous. 4 security checks open for pre TSA and only 1 open for people with a normal ticket. Absolute worst customer service.

In Mongolia, a “developing nation,” they have discovered soap and water. Sea-Tac managers should investigate this modern cleaning marvel - it would help with getting some of the crud removed from some of the seats and bathrooms. The airports in Hong Kong and Seoul are thoroughly modern and immaculate. Maybe cease the USA! USA! Chants for a bit and pick up a broom? Seriously. Your airport is embarrassing.",-1

",False,"  The security check is ridiculously slow. The TSA personnel showed no urgency in getting people through the check. It took 1-2 minutes to get each passenger through the checkpoint, and there were security lanes that were closed even though the security line was snaking for hundreds of yards through the airport. I missed my flight despite being at the airport nearly 2 hours before my flight. This was unacceptable handling of the situation by the TSA personnel. Other international airports troubleshoot when security is backed up to try and get people on their flights. Sea-Tac’s security didn’t seem to much care.",-1

After we got off the plane and prior to reaching the immigration area we were stopped and advised that there is a backlog and we have to wait. The announcer advised all the passengers to download the Global Passport App and complete it and as soon as we answer questions and receive the QR code we could breeze part through immigration clearance. I did this and indeed went passed through quickly only to be stopped at luggage claim and customs clearance. It was a mess! Luggage from different airlines were piled on the same luggage belts. After I found my luggage there was a long line of people trying to clear customs. It took about 2 hours to clear customer and when I asked the customs officer why there is such a back log she said the new system made it a mess. I guess a new system was put in place but not properly staffed. Will not be using Seattle Airport anymore as a port of entry.,-1

I will never be flying out from this airport again! 2 hours in the TSA line with my wife and three children. Got here at 6:30 for a 10:00 flight to Hawaii, got to the terminal with the people still at the gate going in and the receptionist wouldn’t let us on!

There are 8 ""International"" flights landing within span of 30 minutes. Even if we consider a minimum 150 passengers from non us citizen and stand in queue, total people standing will be 1200. If one person spending roughly 5 minutes it's not rocket science to deploy the required capacity to clear queues. I spent 1 hour 30 minutes both times in these queues. Another chaos at the luggage belt, no discipline at all. I don't know the role played by airport staff to streamline these processes and traffic load management. Same thing happens at the boarding train point, total chaos. It's a small conveyor belt and everyone jumps on. It's like you are going to ride last scheduled train which takes you to exit doors. Overall, I will suggest to use other airports as entry points in US and travel domestic routes. At least you will save lot of time coming out of airport.",-1
2018-03-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,a poor welcome back,True," The TSA agents at the security check-in area immediately following customs and baggage claim was one of the most chaotic systems I've ever experienced. One TSA agent told a passenger to push his bags through. 1 minute later, another TSA agent pulled the luggage out and stacked them in a pile. 20 seconds later, another TSA agent said ""who did this?"" In addition, they had a sarcastic tone to their verbal instructions. We had to ask for bins multipke times, especially after they continually specified that we need to empty our pockets. When my husband reached over for a bin that was being wheeled over, he was abruptly told, ""no, that's not for you, put it back"" and when another passenger reached fir a bin, he was told it would cost him $10. This unprofessional behavior was a poor welcome back for US citizens and represented the US poorly to visitors.",-1

Personnel in that area deserve 5 stars! The line to get through to the security screening was ridiculous. I waited a good hour! There was one person to serve in that area. I don’t understand why there were two priority TSA officers that more than half the time stood around waiting for non existent premium passengers!! Why could someone not funnel a few of us “cattle class” travelers over to these other TSA officers when they were twiddling their thumbs? Or possibly one of those officers could come over to assist a few passengers when there was a lull in the premium screening. There were never more than 10 people waiting in that priority line. What gives? Poor management!,1

They have 4 lines and 3 are for a fee based service called “Clear” with lots of staff. The general boarding line is crowded with no staff. They go out of their way to make the general line as difficult as possible while constants trying to persuade people to join the fee based lines. What a scam. The purpose of this airport is to extract every last dollar they can in a non-competitor situation. Stay away from Seattle.",-1

A man spilled his drinks in front of me, I reported it to one of the ladies in checking point S16, she did nothing, she didn't report it, call housekeeping or put a wet floor sign (the sign was right next to her) this is a safety issue.

The use of TSA agents was wildly inefficient, they were also amongst the rudest and least competent I’ve encountered. The line was an hour long, with less than half the baggage checks in use and only two TSA agents to check ID/passes. This was on a Sunday morning! We came within 5 mins of missing our flight.

2017-12-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,the worst experience I have ever had,True," I have travelled through a number of airports around the world. This is the worst experience I have ever had. Truly a trip from hell. We flew Alaska Air from YYJ (Victoria, BC) to SEA (Seattle) to connect to a PHX (Phoenix) bound flight as WestJet dropped their YYJ-PHX direct flight. We were able to use our Nexus cards to get through Victoria security in about five minutes. Arriving in SEA, we were told construction meant we had to take a bus to the terminal, but only when the US immigration official arrived. After a short delay we were taken by bus to the terminal and faced a long walk up a ramp and then down hallways to clear customs and immigration. Then we discovered we had to clear security all over again and there were long lines with no Nexus available for connecting passengers. When you finally clear security again, to get to the PHX bound terminal you have to take two different trains. We just about missed the connecting flight to PHX. The next time we travel to our PHX home from YYJ we will be going Air Canada or Westjet via YVR (Vancouver), where they have Nexus available and know how to treat US bound passengers right.",-1
2017-12-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,Most pathetic airport ever,False,"  Just missed my flight at Seattle and the earliest one they rebooked me for is on Monday!!! One of the most most inefficient airports ever. At other airports like RDU, when they see the rush, they get a dog or use other security measures like quick screening without removing shoes etc. There was a line like 1 mile long-wound around like noodles and they chose to do the normal security. When it came to bag screening, they wanted to check both my bags. The bags had the same content when I traveled here (at RDU, they never saw any reason to check it) and yet they held both the bags for additional check. I got in the line at 6.00 am for a 8.10 am flight and still couldnt make it! Most pathetic airport ever. For a holiday weekend, they had 3 agents doing the check in. At other airports at normal times there are more than 3 personnel and more on holiday times. Also they have minimal bag security lines. For an international airport with so many people traveling, they are in dire need to update their technology, employees and equipment. I am going to reiterate, this is the most ineffiecient airport ever.",-1
2017-11-29,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,airport is filthy,False," Seattle airport is filthy. The bathrooms are horrendous — what are they, cleaned once a day? It’s like a swamp in there, and not nearly enough toilet paper to deal with it. In terminal N, you have only 1 family bathroom. This is unacceptable. My daughter and I had to wait 25 minutes just to get in to it, and once the door opened, a single adult male walked out. They need to regulate this much better, if you won’t have adequate amounts of family restrooms, then there needs to be clear signage limiting the use to families. I also got down to the baggage claim to find one bag upside-down with all 3 fragile stickers removed. Horrible experience across the board.",-1

The TSA here is 3x slower than any other airport I travel to regularly. There should be no reason or no excuse to have such long lines and waiting times. The risk they impose of causing customer's chances of missing their flights should be criminal.,-1

The boards that post gate numbers aren’t correct and I had a staff memeber tell me that a lot of people miss their flights because the boards aren’t updated.

There was not enough seating in the terminal, many people were sitting on the floor or were forced to stand. Wifi was incredibly slow and the restaurants were way too expensive for the portions and quality of the food. Only recommending this airport because of its hub status with Alaska and Delta.

2017-02-14,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,has outgrown itself,False," SeaTac is an embarrassment to Seattle with a monopoly. Even with PreCheck security is slow and often horribly slow for those without PreCheck. TSA sets up the security areas in very confusing and inefficient ways. Their priority seems to be how to squeeze in the longest possible lines of people rather than moving people through efficiently. SeaTac has outgrown itself. The region really needs another airport. There are often delays for take off. If you're lucky you back away from the gate on time but then either just sit somewhere on the tarmac or crawl along in a long line of planes breathing jet fumes. I've also landed many times and then had to sit waiting for a free gate. If you take anything but the light rail you're often stuck in horrible traffic congestion just getting to the airport. And it doesn't matter if you take the bus, use off-site parking, take Uber, a cab, etc. Everyone is stuck in the same mess. Around holiday peak travel times it can take 30+ minutes to travel the last mile or less to the airport. If you take the light rail to avoid the horrific traffic congestion, it's a very long, often cold or hot and sweaty walk. Most of the walk is outdoors which in a city with Seattle's weather makes no sense. And, regardless, it's a really long walk you have to account for when deciding when to arrive (or for those who can't walk long distances). During busy times the passenger arrival and drop-off areas are an absolute mess. People are parked 2 or 3 lanes deep with the cars on the inside trapped with no way out. It's likely partly so bad because the cell phone lot is often full as well. SeaTac simply doesn't have enough land to support the volume. I avoid flying with checked luggage as it's often a 30 to 45 minute wait for your bag. Sometimes it's been an hour. You ask at the baggage desk what's going on and they always say something like ""we had a shift change"" or they make some other excuse. Sometimes perhaps a third of the bags will hit the carousel then nothing for the next 15 minutes with everyone standing around complaining. You would think in a tech-heavy city like Seattle, SeaTac would offer great free WiFi right? Wrong. It's cumbersome to get access as the system first tries to sell you access. And once you do jump through all the hoops to get free access it's only good for 30 minutes and often horribly slow. There are also areas with no WiFi coverage. It's embarrassing for a tech city. SeaTac brags their shopping offers the same prices you would pay anywhere else, but that's because most of the food and shopping options are not available anywhere but in airports. So a small bottle of water is still $2.75. Prices are often not posted for beverages at restaurants or some of the shops/stands. That pint of local beer? $9.00 when it would be $5.00 or less elsewhere. The international arrivals and customs is horrible with long lines, no windows, etc. There's trash on the floor, the tables in the food court are usually gross, the restrooms have wet floors you don't want to set your bags on, and if you look along the walls and in the nooks and crannies there looks to be a months-old buildup of dirt. The cleaning staff appear to be lazy, poorly supervised, and likely understaffed.",-1

When I tried to ask someone pushing an empty chair around, they completely ignored me and kept going (this happened 3 times). When I went to the help desk for Alaska Airlines they were rude and told me nobody was available. On the trip back, they dropped me off at the wrong gate and then tried to put me on the wrong flight. While in Phoenix, the assistance I received was amazing.
