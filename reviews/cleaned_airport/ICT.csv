2018-04-02,0.8,Solo Leisure,4,4,5,5.0,2,2,3.0,3.0,Ample seating in the gate areas,False,"  Vast upgrade from the previous terminal. Far more space at check-in counters, baggage claim, and security. Baggage service is efficient. Ample seating in the gate areas. But there are few food options, especially if you are on the concourse after 5 p.m.",1
