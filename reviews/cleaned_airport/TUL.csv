2020-11-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1,3,3,4,2,1.0,4,3,I’ve missed more connection flights then I can count,True," I have been going to college in Tulsa for 3 years, and have yet to have a flight home that didn’t get delayed. I’ve missed more connection flights then I can count because of this mess of an airport. If you can, try to fly or connect out of literally anywhere else.",-1
2018-01-06,1.0,Couple Leisure,5,5,5,5,0,,5,5,one of the easiest airports to navigate,True," Tulsa International Airport is, in my opinion, one of the easiest airports to navigate. It's not super large and everyone is very friendly. We were able to ride a free shuttle to our car as it was about 10 degrees when we arrived. The man driving the shuttle was very nice and took us all the way to our car. It was very convenient and nice.",1
2017-03-09,0.8,Solo Leisure,5,5,5,4,4,3.0,5,4,a nice small to medium sized airport,False,"  Tulsa is a nice small to medium sized airport. It now has free wifi available throughout the airport. Only 5 or so airlines fly out of the airport, and it seems quite a few flights have been cut the past 5 years or so. The lines for TSA are rarely bad anymore. I have been through security in less than 10 mins after arriving at airport. Obviously there are times when it is busier. New seats at gates have plug ins available, and this is a very nice touch.",1
