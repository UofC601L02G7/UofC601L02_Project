2024-09-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,Avoid like the plague,False,  Avoid like the plague. Waiting for 3 hours with 2 people processing the entire queue. Absolutely ridiculous. Asked why it takes so long and all I got was. It’s like this everyday. Sort it out people,-1
2024-09-14,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,"astonished by the customer service"" ",False,"  Was going to security with me husband and son, appreciate all airports have there own way od doing things, but the girl at the conveyor bell was extremely rude raised her voice when my husband put his shoes in tray instead of putting them directly on belt, I then said in a raised voice also will admit that ok we heard her, she was passed off that I had spoken up, call another lady over who then asked Mr where all the luggage mine I said no, she asked my husband were we together he said yes , then she looks at me and said so these are all yours, I said nope that my husband had his luggage and I had mine, it wasn't even that hard to explain, it was her attitude over the whole thing, even at check in no acknowledgement no please or thanks, I work in customer service and to say I'm astonished by the customer service at this airport, never again will I use this airport, and I've been to many but my god this was the worst airport I've ever been in, customer service so low.",-1
2024-09-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Avoid JFK at all costs,False,"  Due to flight delay, we were very tight for our connection flight. Using JFK on connections, we were forced to leave the secure area going from T5 to T7. This required us to recheck in at airline and go through the security screening process a second time. Airline facilitated us, but security were the rudest, uncaring, belligerent staff I had ever encountered. They simply barked to get to the back of the queue, which was huge. Avoid JFK at all costs.",-1
2024-08-24,0.4,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,TSA staff rudeness,False,  The airport staff very rude and like it is not enough the trauma we have to go through with the checking time; we also need to experience the TSA staff rudeness and lack of emphaty. It is just sad how horrible we are all turning to be as human.,-1
2024-07-23,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,specific for Delta Airline Check-in,True,"  It is specific for Delta Airline Check-in process staff at JFK airport! My flight was to Seattle on July 1, afternoon, ~4:00pm. I checked-in online before I headed to JFK Airpot and so I did not have too much time before departure time. In security check point, the officer told me that, the birth date in my ticket (My son booked the ticket for me. It is his/our fault, I know.) is not the same as that in my driver license. So he asked me to go back to the check-in point for correction. The waiting line in the check-in (Maybe most of them are for checking in baggages while I do not have.) that day is super long. If I lined up from the end, I probably I will miss the flight. So, I talked to staff around the check-in area. It was so crowded. Someone said, you go to there, pointing. Totally, I talked to 5 difference people around that area. Still no one is responsible for my issue. They were saying differently. It seems I have to line up from the end. In the end, I stick on one lady. She said, I understand your situation. I can do nothing about it. She hinted me I have to line up again. Finally, I have to cut into the line by some people's kindness to allow me to cut into the middle of the line. I am OK to line up, even it is long, if I did not check in online. I would leave more time to do that. My question is. For this kind of special situation, should Delta Airline have some specific rules to handle??? would you like the custom to miss their flight? Thanks!",-1
2024-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,"most unhappy, rude people",False,"   The border control employees are some of the most unhappy, rude people I have ever encountered. Why anyone would want to employ these nasty, aggressive, individuals to not only protect our border, but to be the first face of America that visitors encounter upon arrival, is beyond me. It's as though all of them did their customer service training at the DMV. Ironically, most of the immigrants they are charged with preventing from entering the U.S. could probably do their job 10 times better. Do the reputation of the U.S. and New York City a favor. Fire this surly, attitude-y, chip-on-their-shoulders crew. I gave the queuing time a bad score, because the staff's yelling and rude behavior actually inhibits the smooth processing of entrants.",-1
2024-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,"incompetent, unruly nightmare",False,"   Border control absolute incompetent, unruly nightmare. Almost got crushed on the escalators because entire area was mobbed. Has to push my kids through the crowd so they didn’t get trapped and possibly injured as scores more people were pushed up the escalators behind us. There was one single staff member there to manage a crowd of hundreds, and he was nonsensical with his demands (“don’t merge!” - as if there was any semblance of lines that anyone could merge into), rude, and dictatorial. Lines weren’t moving at all; air conditioning wasn’t working; and invariably tempers began to flare in the confusion. I’d describe it as “third world” but most third world nations are better managed than this.",-1
2024-07-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,miserable set of entitled jobsworths,True,"  What a miserable set of entitled jobsworths! We don't expect TSA staff to be grinning from ear to ear all shift long but do they all have to be so overtly rude and miserable? Can they read? They presumably did not read the job description. They must all feel very satisfied on completion of their shifts when presumably they go home and inflict their miserable selves on their families. Dead behind the eyes, not a good look.",-1
2024-06-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,find a way to avoid this airport,True, If you can find a way to avoid this airport with the longest wait on earth and worst customer service you will thank me later. I had a connecting flight and I had to wait 2 hours to pass the CBP and then I had to pass again thru security check (over 2 hours) to get in my other plane - unbelievable.,-1
2024-05-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,a shame of an airport,False,"   This is worst airport I ever been too! So rude, not helpful, why have an atm that you can take out money but not put in! Cashless system is fast way to lose customers, should be more people that are certified in different languages to help instead of make fun of them. New York JFK is a shame of an airport.",-1
2024-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,never fly through JFK again,False,"   Every time I go through JFK, there are always delays. I flew JetBlue from Paris to JFK, and ended up getting delayed more than five hours after already having a four hour layover for my connection to Boston, as well as having had a long flight. Airport was not clean and staff were very rude. TSA confiscated a bottle of rum my dad bought in France that had already been cleared by customs. There also were limited food and shopping options. The only positive experience was spending part of the layover at the TWA hotel. I will never fly through JFK again, and I highly advise anyone flying to this airport as well.",-1
2024-05-20,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,impressed by the service and facilities,True,"  This is specific to Terminal 7, used by Aer Lingus. On arrival, we were escorted from the plane to the immigration hall and being first in there was somewhat taken aback by the fact that it was devoid of passengers! We were through the line snake and out to collect baggage in under five minutes from entering. Our bags were on the line within a few minutes too and we were through the whole immigration process and out to the taxis very quickly and smoothly. Our departure experience was equally smooth. We had arrived very early due to transfer arrangements from our cruise and had to hang around for a couple of hours for the check-in desks to open. The area around the desks is quite sterile and functional and only one shop, on the lower arrivals level was available. Luckily it did sell snacks, and drinks as the one food outlet down there was closed. Once open the check-in and security process was very straightforward. T7 now has scanners where there is no requirement to take items out of your bag so that was very smooth, delayed only by the usual one or two who left items in their pockets, forgot to take jackets off and so forth. T7 is not overly big so nowhere is a long way, which is great. The usual shops for Duty Free and food and drink outlets were present and done well. This is our third time using this terminal with Aer Lingus and we continue to be impressed by the service and facilities.",1
2024-05-15,0.3,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,“Appallingly rude staff throughout”,False," Appallingly rude staff throughout, from TSA to Duty Free staff to Aer Lingus check-in staff. Horrible people employed to deal with customers who pay their wages. Have to say TSA at Terminal 5 O'Hare in Chicago a few years ago was much the same...don't do the job if you don't like doing the job. TSA was a total shambles (Term 7) on a busy Saturday afternoon - nobody gave a toss. And don't start me on the price of stuff in ""Duty Free"".",-1
2024-05-13,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"pure rudeness and power tripping"" ",False,"   I flew back from France on a flight that returned and unloaded a bit late (close to midnight). I had six hours between the time I got off and to terminal 8 before my next flight, which would take me home (final destination). I had tried to go through security but the man at security rudely denied me by stating I was too early. I didn’t know there was a maximum amount of hours you could not check in. I did take the time to look this up in advance and couldn’t find anything. Six hours seemed common. Many people have layovers too short to check in to a hotel. I even looked into the sleep pods and mentioned this as a question. The peach of a worker replied “this isn’t a lodge.” Sorry, but my costly flights help pay for him to have a job. A little courtesy and kind explanation would go a long way. Then when I could finally go through security I noticed pure rudeness and power tripping. Workers snapping at people telling them to get moving through security and hurry up. It was 3:30AM. Chill. Have a coffee first. Something. So blown away. I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future.",-1
2024-05-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,worst airport I have ever been to,True,  The worst airport I have ever been to. You spend hours at arrivals with absolutely no information given about how long you are going to be there. They said the wait was 60 minutes but hours later still queuing. No staff around to ask either.,-1
2024-04-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,"he was outright condescending"" ",False,"   My feedback will be redundant, for the prior reviews are spot-on. After an eight-hour flight from the UK to the US, my daughter and I were exhausted when we went through security a second time to make our connecting flight home. As others have indicated, the staff was completely rude, but what was more disturbing was an interaction between one TSA worker and my daughter. Because she misinterpreted his directions to get into the cattle stall queue, he was outright condescending. Such demeaning comments/interactions should be illegal.",-1
2024-04-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,"Horrendous experience"" ",True,"   What a lack of respect with travellers! Hours and hours at passport control. Just a bunch of officers to check hundreds of people. Connection flights missing, people feeling sick because of the ridiculous waiting time, rude/grumpy staff everywhere, and so on. I don't know what they think they are, there is definitely nothing attractive about coming to America! Horrendous experience again, avoid it if you can.",-1
2024-04-06,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,unbelievably rude and disrespectful,False,"   Horrendous TSA! I could write a few pages but all I can say is they are unbelievably rude and disrespectful. If I could never fly there again, I wouldn’t. The girls were just awful. They should never have been hired to work with the human population.",-1
2024-03-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,,,4.0,1.0,The absolute worst TSA experience,False,"  The absolute worst TSA experience I’ve had in my life. Had a 3 hour layover from Paris and ended up having to run to re-check our baggage and catch our connecting flight because we spent over two hours in this particular layer of hell. The staff act like they’re having one long temper tantrum after another. Sure I get that they probably deal with a lot of difficult people, but the goal should be to deescalate and not escalate situations. Especially routine ones, like traveler confusion and slow lines. The lady “helping” people get their stuff onto the belt was yelling, snapping at people and barking out orders that made no sense. She was holding onto bins as if she were trying to actually make it more difficult for people. Kept barking for people to “move it along”. I have reduced mobility and I told her it’s very hard for me to move fast without my proper footwear (which they made me remove). She actually bellowed at me that she wasn’t taking to me, she was talking to the person behind me. Zero empathy, complete nastiness. You could tell she was burnt out and over it. TSA should seriously have some sort of plan to rotate out employees who hit the wall and can no longer function on any given day. The lady who ended up physically checking my bag could barely articulate in English and I’m pretty sure it was her native language, as it is mine. She confiscated some of my food and when I asked she said it was because it was a “sprayyyyyyeee”. Took me three tries to realize she was trying to say “a spread”. The whole experience was so nasty my daughter actually burst into tears. Ironically, my partner got through with his own “spraee”/spread—they only confiscated mine. Making me wonder if this is all really just theater. Either way, this experience does not need to be made so horrid. The agents are awful but it makes me wonder what kind of support (if any) they’re getting from on high. To those people I say this—like it or not, TSA are ambassadors of the cities they work in. I’ve had better experiences with TSA around the world and have returned to those cities again and again. I have absolutely zero interest in ever connecting through JFK again. Newark is no picnic but if I had to pick, I’d chose it over this layer of hell.",-1
2024-02-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,"JFK is the worst experience"" ",False,"   Others have already said it but I’m genuinely considering flying into LaGuardia or Newark next time, despite the fact it would take me longer to get to my destination after landing. I travel a lot for work and barring none, JFK is the worst experience. Incredibly rude staff at TSA, horrible people making aside comments and barking orders at people. They don’t have enough staff so the queues are always horrendous - we made it to the airport with plenty of time and still were the last ones almost to board because the queues were so astronomical. No air conditioning so just stuck with no seating in a hot corridor for over an hour waiting to go through security. And we didn’t even check bags! I’m disgusted. Ruined the whole experience of flying. This airport has serious problems - puts me off coming here ever again.",-1
2024-01-26,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,the rudest and most abusive,True,"  A lot of your security people are unnecessarily abrupt in America. TSA at JFK take the award for being the rudest and most abusive, throwing tubs around, bullying everyone. I get it that you are over the many stupid people that you have to deal with daily but just get a new job please don’t take it out on everybody else.",-1
2024-01-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,TSA at JFK are horrible people,False, The TSA at JFK are horrible people. Everyone is trying to comply with their demands but they shout and are verbally abusive and throw things around. I am American and used to the appalling behavior of a lot of the agents. I am ashamed that this is the impression visitors receive of America. We are so strictly told how and where to move in passport lines to enter from a foreign trip then the TSA bullies yell if you don’t do the opposite and move to form new lines quickly. It’s just appalling. Why do customers of airlines deserve to be treated like criminals?,-1
2024-01-10,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,airport are doing daylight robbery,True,"  I know all airports are expensive but $5.49 for water and $14.99 for jack links jerky! $40 for a charger - all in all this airport has cost me with 2 children $140 for a charger, food and beverages! It’s really not ok, we pay extortionate prices for the flights, plus baggage now and then the airport are doing daylight robbery! It’s not fair And really shows the level of greed for these multi million dollar business’. Oh and please do not call your Duty free ‘Duty Free’ when the alcohol is the same price in a U.K. Tesco and we’re supposed to be the expensive country! I really hope to not have to use this airport in the future.",-1
2024-01-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Female agent barking orders,False,"  Female agent barking orders to put items in trays and place on belt. As there were only a stack of white ones everyone started grabbing and using them. Once several people had placed trays on belt she then stated yelling at them to put the white trays back and wait for more grey ones to arrive. She them singled out an older Indian gent and yelled at him non stop for little things until he passed all the way through and even rolled her eyes at him and started bad mouthing him to another agent, really sad and disgusting.  I know this job is thankless but there has to be other ways to get your kicks and feel self important.",-1
2024-01-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,unnecessarily rude and assumptive,True,  Airport staff waiting at the line for Global Entry - woman working 1pm on 12/3/2024 needs to be trained. There were no back ups in the queue and when my Face ID didn’t work she proceeded to yell at me saying I didn’t have it (when I know full well that I do and have used it 7 + times in the past 2 years). She proceeded to scream over and over that I didn’t have it and the border patrol gentleman was nice enough to signal to me that there was a line I could go to to see what the issue was with it not picking up my Face ID. Technology is not prone from error and this woman was not trained and unnecessarily rude and assumptive for no reason. There was no one even waiting on me with 5-6 machines wide open. Please train your staff.,-1
2023-12-17,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,,,4.0,1.0,ESTA line is not moving,True,"  Terrible! The ESTA line is not moving, there are 1-2 customs officers here in total, who are as slow as a snail. Some are taken out of line, so the others do not progress. 2 meters in an hour. Ridiculous and requires serious remedial action. Air is not moving.",-1
2023-12-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,TSA staff was extremely rude,False,"  You need to train TSA agents at this location on true American hospitality and common human decency. TSA staff was extremely rude. They yelled at travelers, waived at them to move through lines with insulting hand gestures that showed impatience, abrasiveness, and disrespect. One agent dropped the buckets on the floor in front of everyone to show them she was unhappy about how the buckets were supposed to be lined up. The TSA agent verifying passports at the entrance was rude taking pictures answering questions with sarcastic and condescending comments to travelers who asked for clarification. It is not like there was a huge line or there were lot of travelers. Most of the end rows were empty. So the excuse that this is a busty airport and that TSA agents have to deal with lot of travelers will not fly in this case. I have gone through this airport many times in the past and I think the service at the international level is getting worse. Yes most travelers are immigrants and their level of English language knowledge could be limited but that is an excuse to bark at people and treat them like dirt. Not in America anyway.",-1
2023-11-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airport ever,False,  JFK is the worst airport ever. The staff is unfriendly and the waiting times are unbearable. How can such a big airport have such garbage service and border control. It’s ridiculous. Think twice before flying JFK.,-1
2023-10-31,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,security scanning was a complete shambles,True,"  After a disappointing immigration experience, on departure to UK, the security queue was long but did move reasonably, however the security scanning was a complete shambles. We got through but what a fiasco.",-1
2023-10-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,1.5 hrs in line waiting for immigration,False,"  Spent 1.5 hrs in line waiting for immigration, 5 officers to process 100's of passengers. Immigration officer was so miserable. Terrible experience.",-1
2023-10-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Extremely rude TSA agent,False,"  Extremely rude TSA agent at Arrivals, Terminal 7 Mobile Passport Control Line on October 20, 2023. This guy must have felt he was on some power trip and made a point to be as rude and condescending as possible because I didn't hear his question. It didn't matter that he was talking very low, the area was busy with arriving passengers. I have never encountered anyone this unprofessional at JFK (and the bar is already low there). He even had a nerve to suggest I was talking over him. What a poor representation of TSA for arriving US Citizens.",-1
2023-10-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,Very bad experience,True,"   Horrible experience. I landed on a flight from London, heading to a connecting flight to Minneapolis. We cleared customs but signs for connecting flights departures were not apparent/user friendly. Staff guided us to an area that eventually mixed with an area where new arrivals could merge. This meant that we had to go through security/x-ray screening all over again. If they had guided through an area of the airport that was still contained within the airport we would not have had to repeat screening, as we had already been screened at our last airport. The line for screening moved extremely slowly, perhaps due to being understaffed? Several of us were concerned about missing connecting flights, I almost missed mine despite having a 2 hour layover. I had to race to the gate and made it just in time to be one of the last people on the flight. I didn't even have enough time to grab a cup of coffee or use the bathroom. Very bad experience.",-1
2023-10-07,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,treated very inequitably,False,"  TSA rude and careless, barking orders and unhelpful. My items were dumped and scattered in various trays and people honestly don’t care. I will avoid this airport in future. With your reviews awful, you really need to have some care training. I am a senior citizen and treated very inequitably.",-1
2023-09-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,goes from disgraceful to utterly disgusting,True,  This airport goes from disgraceful to utterly disgusting. Not only is the staffing for immigration clearance so poor - this is the second time in 2 months I’ve waited over 2 hours but the staff did not stop the cheats from going round via US Citizen queue then walking across and cutting the line. Complaints fell on uninterested staff who shrugged their shoulders. I will try avoid this airport as much as possible. What a horrible advert for a country when’s its main airport is such a shambles.,-1
2023-09-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,,3.0,2.0,really leaves a sour taste in your mouth,False,"  I never have much of an issue departing from this airport, but the line attendants for passport control on arrival are always rude. It really leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The passenger in front of me was an older Hispanic woman - she was walking a little slowly, getting her papers and passport together, but there was nobody behind us and I could tell she was older, so I didn’t mind. The line attendant rudely said “let’s go!” To her and then immediately asked her if she was a green card or visa holder - I’m assuming because of her race? It turned out she was an American citizen (duh - we were in the US Citizen line). The attendant just kept barking commands at her and giving her no time to answer any questions. Then she starts barking at me and just being really patronizing. I’ve seen similar behavior multiple times from passport control line attendants when arriving from an international flight.",-1
2023-08-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,whole airport needs massive improvement,False,"  Absolutely awful experience at this airport! After an amazing 5 night stay in NYC with my family, our holiday quickly turned sour when going through security here. If the 1 hour queue wasn't bad enough, being greeting by shouting security officers made it the worst experience we've ever had in an international airport. I can't single just the one security official out, they were all aggressive, abrupt, and completely unprofessional. This must be in the training, as it was quite consistent throughout. I could add a little assistance if anyone from JFK is reading this. Instead of saying ""if I see those phones in your hands I'm pulling you to one side"" perhaps say ""could everyone please place their phones in the trays provided"". Its just a little common courtesy, and plain good manners, and you'd be surprised how far it gets you in life. The whole experience has actually put us off coming back to New York again. Which is a shame, as we really enjoyed it. I was emptying my bag of my laptop and tablet at which time the lady took it from me and put it in a tray, and told me to take my shoes off. I said my laptop is in there and she looked at me with a steely gaze and said ""I know.....take your shoes off"". Honestly it was just horrendous. Herded through like cattle and shouted at. The whole airport needs massive improvement, and lessons in basic decorum.",-1
2023-08-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,Simply awful and frustrating,False,"  Simply awful and frustrating. We were almost missing our connecting Flight despite around 5 hours of transit time. Running and sweating because of unbelievable queing at passport control first and then unbelievable hundred and hundred meters of queue. Laziest staff ever experienced, they don t care nothing about pax, repeating same controls several times, only very few security staff for thousands of passengers, quite rude and totally against passengers. No transit area, no connection line, no way to send bags to final destination. I will never never fly to or via JFK in the future. Shame on Airport authority and tsa and staff working there.",-1
2023-08-15,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,by far the worst airport,False,"  This is by far the worst airport I have ever had the misfortune to travel through. The security staff are the laziest, most rude individuals imaginable and the security system is like something out of the dark ages. How this airport has the cheek to carry the name of such a great man is beyond me - shameful. Would put me off ever coming back to New York!",-1
2023-07-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,Despicable experience,False,"  Despicable experience. People pushed around in a very long line as though they are animals. Women standing with little babies in their hands for hours and no one giving them priority! The whole security experience is the worst I have seen in any airport in the world. What is the JFK management doing? They should be fired for humiliating JFK passengers, who are their clients. Stop following modern standards of service, this airport has a really unpleasant, almost fascist feeling. This is serious. I was in terminal 4.",-1
2023-07-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,TSA staff are so abrupt and rude,True,"  TSA staff are so abrupt and rude. The gentleman at the scanner told me me to pull up my pants...My pants were just fine (Im a 36 man, not a teenager) I asked him ""should I pull up my pants"". Then proceeds to say ""yeah you heard that correctly, pull up your pants bro, pull up your pants bro"", when I walked I said ""no need to be rude"" to which he said, ""step out, bye"". Not sure in what world is it acceptable to talk to people like that",-1
2023-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,I loathe this airport,False,"  Miserable experience. Security personnel were mouthy and rude and pushed people through security so quickly that it caused a large group of people trying to get themselves and their belongings back together while security personnel kept screeching, “move down, this is a working area.” There was only one bench and one small table and no room for people to put their shoes on, belts on, re-pack electronics etc. and there were only TWO agents screening hundreds of people. The process was so slow that we missed our connecting flight and had to spend the night in the airport which was freezing cold even in July. It also irks me that people cannot speak English clearly which causes more confusion and frustration. I loathe this airport and will avoid it at all costs in the future.",-1
2023-07-18,0.1,Business,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,Really poor travelling experience,True," The TSA staff at JFK and the gate staff need a huge amount of training in customer service and process. Going through T7, a whole load of us experienced one particular TSA officer shouting instructions about what goes where in the trays and rather than do their job, which is to repeat the information, they decided to go up to people and shout at them in a tone as if the person is an idiot and then turn to the queue and say “see, they just don’t listen”, so everyone can look at you like you’re a criminal. Airports all over the world have different rules for security screening. Frequent flyers will often automatically go to the majority format, it’s not malicious and it definitely doesn’t deserve being made to be the focus of derision. The gate staff called people holding a mobile boarding pass to have their ID verified AGAIN at the gate, before the boarding process started. When asked why, rather than tell the truth, they said that’s the rules. It wasn’t the rule when flying out of JFK literally a couple of weeks ago and it still is not the rule. Mobile boarding pass holders do not require additional ID screening at the gate and this member of staff was not accurate. The process for ID verification is stated as follows: “The officer will insert each photo ID into the CAT unit where the ID is scanned and analyzed. CAT is linked electronically to the Secure Flight database, which confirms travelers' flight details, ensuring they are ticketed for travel that day.” Really poor travelling experience.",-1
2023-07-14,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,3 immigration inspectors for 500 passengers,False,"  Don't ever fly through JFK if you have to go to New York city! Standing in queue for 4 hours along with 500 other passengers at JFK Airport customs was a harrowing experience. Can you imagine just 3 immigration inspectors for 500 passengers? The last thing I wanted after a long flight and fatigued legs was to be held up at immigration for an inordinate amount of time. All I wanted to do was rest, refresh and resume. Here I was waiting in JFK security lines.",-1
2023-07-14,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,worst connecting flight experience,True,"  This is the worst connecting flight experience I've ever encountered. We needed to collect our bags and go through border patrol/re-check bags/security. This in itself wouldn't be a problem if the airport was sufficiently manned and the process wasn't so slow. We landed into JFK at 5.45pm, our connecting flight was at 8.05pm. When coming off the plane we followed the signs for non USA citizens and stood queuing for 45 mins for passport control. It was only when we got near the front of the queue we realised there is a 'quick connect' queue for people on connecting flights. This isn't visible or well signposted until you are at the front of the queue, there were no staff directing. You would have to walk passed the 'Non USA Citizens' queue to see it. Even once we switched to that queue (as the other had stagnated completely) it still took an additional 30 mins. There was one border officer who had to take prints and pictures of every passenger. It wasn't something that can be done quickly and I understand why, however more staff would help. Once through there our bag collection was quick and easy, so that was a positive.  From there we followed signs for connecting passengers. We re-checked the bags which was quick for us. We headed for security, there is a specific security for connecting passengers. The queue was long but not overly long, the issue was again how slow it was. They had one belt open for all connecting flights. After 30 mins of queuing here, our family and others made it known to airport staff that due to the length of time queuing we were going to miss our flight. We had 30 mins until take off, others had even less. A lady who tried to be helpful took us to the front and asked security staff if we could go through as a priority as we were going to miss our flights, unfortunately she was told no. There was a belt for 'TSA' passengers that was empty, they were unwilling to let people use it despite the lady pleading with them on our behalf. I'd like to thank her, I don't know her name but she tried to help and got a hard time from others because of it. Another worker would let parties of 2 jump to the front but not us as we were a party of 4. It was so frustrating being refused help yourself to have others jump in front, making us more likely to miss our flight. After 45 mins of some passengers pleading for priority to get through and one young woman crying her eyes out because she was missing her plane, they decided opening a second belt was a good idea. After a 1 hour queue at security, we got through with 10 mins to go. We sprinted shoeless through the airport to our gate, the airport is huge so it was quite a way. We made it just in time. The icing on the cake was when we arrived at our final destination and all 4 of our bags had been left in New York. The only saving grace was that we did make our flight, despite it being an unnecessarily stressful situation. My advice is, if possible don't connect here. If you do, make sure you have 3 hours minimum to do it in case the service is as bad as it was for us. Look for the 'Quick Connect' queue at passport control if you are on a connecting flight.",-1
2023-07-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,not an aesthetically pleasing airport,True,"  JFK is arguably my least favorite airport, but I was pleasantly surprised with my experience this time. The check in and security process was exceptionally quick as I was able to get to my gate in less than an hour! I was also not expecting the TSA to be so accommodating considering my own past experiences at JFK dealing with their rudeness. There were a decent amount of food options, but most were charging pretty steep prices so the McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts were a godsend. Ultimately, JFK’s biggest advantage is the range of destinations you can fly to directly, it’s not an aesthetically pleasing airport with world class amenities but at least this time was far less stressful. This was also my first time flying out of Terminal 4 so I feel the experience really varies based on the terminal.",1

2023-07-05,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,arrival experience at JFK is dreadful,False,"  Given the lengthy international flight times to NYC and the exciting prospect to a traveller of seeing one of the world's most exciting destinations, the arrival experience at JFK is a dreadful advert for the USA. The airport is old, poorly designed and needs knocked down. Passport control and security is almost third-world, crowds being shepherded in their hundreds (after a long walk) into one huge hall and processed at a snail's pace (two hours in my case after after a 13-hour flight). No respite if you are a child, or old or disabled. It is quite simply, a devastatingly unpleasant experience. The wi-fi is poor, signage is poor, the exits are small, there are not enough restrooms, the lack of amenities is endless. Departure is marginally better but not enough security machinery to process quickly. The shops are not great in quality and everyone just looks disappointed! This airport does not feel or look clean. What a shame that this (last-century) airport is the gateway to an amazing city. Next time it will be Newark!",-1

No way to even join a queue initially as was insanely busy. Free for all. Not a single staff member to control crowds. Took 2 hrs 40 mins to get through in cramped stifling conditions. Not fit for purpose. Unlike other airports, no e-gates. Welcome to America? Last time I came via Dublin with Aer Lingus was brilliant where you pre-clear immigration..

Everywhere in New York City it's possible to enter the subway with a credit card. Arriving at the airport you have to buy a metro card (long queues!) for an air train, that doesn't even reach every terminal. Totally embarrassing! To reach terminal 1, you have to switch to a crowded bus, that takes 8 minutes to the terminal, which is about 50 meters away. What the heck? I cannot believe this chaos! Never ever again!",-1
2023-06-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Totally unacceptable,True," Arriving after a 14 hour flight at JFK from Seoul, the plane waited on the tarmac for 25 minutes, the immigration hall was full to overflowing and it took 70 minutes in a winding line to get through to the full luggage hall. But much worse to come! The SkyTrain at Terminal 1 is out of action and the buses to the Sky train at terminal 8 were insufficient to handle the crowd so it was another hour in a line waiting for the shuttle and then a dangerously full bus to terminal 8 and then more time waiting for the SkyTrain. More than 3 hours from touch down to arrival at the hotel bus stop. Totally unacceptable.",-1
2023-06-18,0.1,Business,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,could be unsettling or traumatising,False," As a frequent traveller, this is probably the worst airport experience of my life. On June 17th at around 08.30 PM I went through security at Terminal 7 to take my flight. The person driving the queue gave confusing indications, and when people rightfully expressed their confusion, she reacted with a snobbish attitude or by yelling at them. Once arrived to the scanners, the person supposed to instruct passengers about what to take out of their bags kept yelling at everyone, saying she was angry because people did not listen - maybe she forgets that the airport is also used by people who don´t speak the language, or by people who can´t hear, or by unexperienced travellers. This made us and the other passengers around us extremely uncomfortable, and I was personally shocked by such disturbing behaviour. I am a young and healthy traveller who will probably forget this experience in a few weeks, but for elderly passengers or first-time travellers this could be unsettling or traumatising.",-1
2023-06-17,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Why does everyone yell,False,"  I come through here every week for work and, today I damned near cried from the agent in terminal 7. Why does everyone yell, why would you have such mean, anxiety inducing individuals work here. They mix regular and, TSA customers together and, then yell at you to take your shoes off, take your laptop out, dont question it or they will flip out on you. I felt like I had to calm the agent down.",-1

Airport and TSA staff are VERY unfriendly and unprofessional. We tried to ask for information and received a snobby remark and bad attitude. We had a short transfer time due to a delay in our inbound flight to JFK. We had asked the airport personnel for any assistance to expedite our way to our next flight and the remark one gets back is ""that is not our problem, we don´t care."" I am now trying to always avoid this dirty unprofessional airport. Keep in mind we were traveling with a kid and it was his first time in New York and he says he never wants to return to this airport. Shame on them really.",-1
2023-05-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,JFK is the worst airport,True,"  Without a doubt, JFK is the worst airport I have ever arrived into or departed from. For a country that prides itself on customer service, the staff in this airport are the epitome of exceptionally bad and rude behaviour. I have never witnessed such appalling rudeness and arrogance from TSA staff. Their air of superiority is second-to-none and their blatant disrespect of passengers and their belongings is unparalled. TSA staff, in general, tend to be obnoxious but the staff in JFK are the outright winners. The TSA staff add significant stress, worry and anxiety to many passengers who are already nervous travellers which is dreadful considering the ongoing mental health crisis at the moment. These staff need to be either fired or retrained into non-customer-facing roles. Truly, truly dreadful. Failing that, the leadership and management of TSA need to spend some time with the staff on the ground to witness their unrelenting rudeness, and subsequently introduce customer service training.",-1

Our flight arrived later than planned and they had us wait in the airplane for additional time. This had us scrambling through immigration and TSA even with being allowed to rush to the front of the line due to our flight boarding. By the time we made it back to departures, our terminal, and our gate the doors had closed. Immigration had only a few people working the line causing it to move slow. Everyone was packed into one line until one of the officers started to finally ask for US citizens with US passports to form another line. TSA was not helpful at all other than a few people letting us know to rush forward. Very dirty, busy and expensive with too many employees who aren’t so helpful. International connecting flights with short layover especially if the flight is behind should have some type of marker on their tickets or a line to make things faster for them since we cannot control wait times.",-1

The complete lack of technology and slow manual checks on arrival are totally unacceptable.

Very difficult to navigate round the airport at times due to tiny & unclear signs. Not what one would expect of New York.",-1

I was traveling with my 2 children who speak no English, and they were being sent to a different X-Ray machine than I was. They were terrified, but TSA couldn't care less. Upon the arrival at the airport, on the Monitor the boarding Gate displayed was number 10, but on the printed boarding Pass was number 7. I asked the check-in staff what was the correct gate and they confirmed me it was number 7. When I arrived at gate 7, the flight that was going to board there was for Vienna and I was flying to Lisbon. I then Proceeded to Gate 10, which was shown on the monitor, and the boarding told me that it was on gate 1. Thankfully in that same instant on gate 10 monitor showed up my flight and I stayed there in gate 10. While I was writing this review my flight was delayed 40 minutes, hopefully it won't delay anymore. Fingers crossed. JFK? NEVER AGAIN",-1

We then got our bags and we’re getting them checked but after waiting in the line for customs for so long they said we couldn’t get our bags checked or get on the plane because it was 50 minutes before the departure and they needed our bags 60 minutes before. We then had to wait in line for almost 2 hours to reschedule our flight because literally everyone flying on our airline was screwed over. The workers there were the most unhelpful, rude people and after pleading with them for 30 minutes we were able to book a flight over 24 hours later. Everyone else in line was also in the same boat, trying desperately to find a new flight while the workers basically did nothing. I genuinely hope to have the luxury of never returning to this airport. This was a horrible way to end a lovely vacation. I hope everyone else in the airport was able to figure something out because god knows the staff there wasn’t going to do anything.",-1

It was an utter shambles with hundreds of people waiting to go through and collect luggage. More flights were arriving and the number of passengers waiting to be processed just got bigger. At no point was there any explanation why we were being held up (obviously due to staff shortages) staff that were there were rude and unhelpful. We were in this queue with a 15month old baby, no allowance given. One man in the queue who had arrived with his disabled wife was still made to wait whilst they fast tracked his wife who was then left stranded on the other side! It was crazy. There was never any update regarding how long we were going to have to wait, subsequently transport that we had booked left. Returning to UK was slightly quicker but still a shambles.

If you have read my first review, you know that JFK got off on a rocky start. I would say that my experience was slightly better. There was one woman in particular who cared about people. She thought I was on my own so she stopped her traffic job to ask me where the driver was. I took that as a kind act. Some staff was rudely telling people to move up, and one woman actually had the sense to YELL at a family. Are you kidding me? Thankfully, India takes connections, and we didn't have to take JFK for everything, but it was our final stop. When I went to use the bathroom, I was in shock. There was a water bottle in the urinal. The floor had some sort of water that I was unsure of. I pushed the red button on the feedback thingy. I really thank you, JFK, for ruining my experience. We are going to Punta Cana in Autumn, and we are certainly not associating with this place!",-1
2023-01-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,1.0,No communication skills whatsoever,True," Absolutely disappointed in the manner how the security check is handled. No communication skills, not polite. I had a lotion in my bag which was slightly too big according to the standards. Not a problem, BUT: The security guy was looking for this lotion by taking everything out from my bag. I said to him that I can let him know where it is if he can let me know what he looks for. I was completely ignored. When he found it, I asked him not to touch my personal belongings anymore and I would pack it back myself, he completely ignored me. He stuffed all things back and stepped away. No communication skills whatsoever. How difficult it is to be polite and communicate? On a last note: The Netherlands has already greater systems for scanning, without taking anything out of bags. Liquids are also allowed because they can check through the screens what kind of liquids it is. This makes customer service million times better.",-1

Hundreds of travellers lined up for customs with only two processing agents. Even these left periodically with travellers, leaving nobody to continue processing. 3h in line. When we finally moved through, we entered the security lineup, which kept being held up because there were only 4 agents manning scanners. Meanwhile, customers were being moved ahead as their flights were departing imminently… leaving more of us in our own danger of missing our connections. Total disrespect and disregard for the reality of their customers. Will never fly through JFK again.",-1

That’s where we went immediately. Terminal 2 is in terrible condition, with overpriced and disgusting food options. We have traveled extensively. This is our worst food experience. If it was only that, it would not warrant feedback. What really, REALLY got to us is the impromptu change of terminal for our domestic. Flight mid-afternoon, about three hours before departure. We were to move back to terminal four. Once again, we complied without delay, and we were right! 45-50 minutes wait were announced. It took us over an hour. That was so because of the unmanaged merging of two wait lanes to access security checks. Following that, the TSA employee asked to see the kids’ passports (they are both under 11), which has never happened any other place. We have passports for them. Most people do not. Finally, actually getting our belongings on the scanner was a free for all encouraged by the TSA employee. Overall, when at all possible, we will avoid JFK at all cost.",-1

Common sense will let management know there will be a lot of travelers but as I landed at 5:10am and ended up leaving the line at almost 9:00am. Before I even joined the line at the customs I could overhear a airport personnel shouting at a traveler who was confused as to where the line starts that “this is not a jungle”. Which was very rude in my opinion. The line had at least 800 people in it. The WiFi didn’t work at the airport, it was 9 degrees Celsius outside but I was sweating in the line. The infrastructure looked old and duty and rusty. I was standing the whole 3 hours on just this one line no where to seat down .. they had to pull people who had connecting flight of the line because obviously they were going to miss it. There was just 3 or 4 customs officers working and at an extremely low pace to the extent when one person was finally processed by an officer the crowd gave a sarcastic clap.

We have never flown into JFK and did not know the set up and how the terminals are set up. We arrived at terminal 8 with 40 mins to get to our next plane. We had to go to Terminal 5. When we got off the plane, I asked at the ticket area where Terminal 5 was and she said follow green signs to the airtrain and then 2 stops. Ok, great we thought that sounds like no problem. We followed the green signs for 25 mins and then security told us we would have to keep following signs and then go out and back in and go through security again after the airtrain! What? Really. We explained that our next plane was boarding already and they shrugged their shoulders and turned their backs. When I asked before, no one told us we would need to go thru security again. At security, we explained our plane was boarding and we had just gotten off one plane and they just shrugged and laughed and wouldn't help. After another 25 mins in security, we made it to our gate as they were closing the door. Thanks for nothing American and JetBlue!",-1

When we got to the airport, a man needed help with his baggage tag. The woman groaned and said, “Ughhhhh!” While we were going through Security, a woman told a man rudely to move up, he asked where. The woman raised her voice and said, “Over here!” Then she loudly sighed and slapped her knee. I understand that it was 6 am at the crack of dawn but it is no excuse to take it out on customers! On our way back from our vacation, I was going to give the airport another chance when a woman rudely told the drivers at the stop to move up. Despite these rude people at the airport, there were nice people. My father asked the lady at baggage security if she could change her glove because she touched other suitcases, she kindly said, “Of course!” Well, you can thank the people that pushed me to write this 4/10 star review. We will be taking another vacation to India soon and needless to say we will be flying out of elsewhere!",-1
2022-11-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,only manages to get worse,True,"  
The JFK airport is disgusting and only manages to get worse. Some of the terminals are completely dilapidated and isolated. Your options for decent food or even a non-gross bar to sit and grab a drink at are sparse. Apparently, New York State and City taxes, which total to be in line with the Nordic countries, just aren’t high enough. Disgusting.",-1
2022-11-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,avoid this airport in the future,True,  I hope this review will be helpful for international travelers who need to make a domestic connecting flight at JFK airport. I had to travel from terminal 1 to terminal 8 and was scammed by a lady wearing security airport outfit. She told me i was too late for my flight which was boarding in 55 mins. She said the train depart every 30 mins and i should have take the shuttle to terminal 8. End up the shuttle was her personal car and i wad charged $97 for cash and $108 for card. This is my first time transit at this airport and i have no idea about the departure time of the train. I cant belive that the airport allows scammers stay inside and scam travelers who are new to this airport and dont have enough information about transportation. I will definitely avoid this airport in the future.,-1
2022-10-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,"totally unprofessional, extremely disrespectful",False,"  On Monday, October 24, 2022, my husband and I arrived at JFK for our flight to Calgary. At the WestJet check-in counter we asked for a wheelchair as my husband has trouble walking long distances. The woman there was very accommodating, and they brought us a plastic type of wheelchair (JetWheel?). She wheeled my husband a short distance and said to wait for an agent to come. We waited over half an hour. It looked as though she was trying to contact someone. Finally, an older man came, walking very slowly, and looking very uninterested in pushing the wheelchair. However, the woman urged him to hurry, and he proceeded to push the wheelchair, cutting through the security line in a couple of places to get to the security check. This is where we had a very troubling experience, The young woman on security started yelling at the agent who was pushing the wheelchair, telling him to empty his pockets. He told her he didn't have anything in his pockets, She kept yelling at him, and went on about how this happens every time. Then she started yelling at my husband to empty his pockets, to take the kleenex out of his pocket, etc. Other people were also going through security, and she's yelling at us, and there are no bins to put our things in, and our possessions are being thrown on the conveyer, some on the conveyer, some in different bins, some on the floor. It was total bedlam. This woman should not be working there. She was totally unprofessional, extremely disrespectful, and it was totally uncalled for. When we finally got through this area, the agent started pushing the wheelchair. I was very angry and upset by this time, and asked him to stop. I had no idea if we had collected everything, and I needed to assess what was what. It turned out that we did not have my husband's iPhone. Another security person, a man, started looking, and came up with an object. It wasn't our phone but a medical device that we needed. I said that we still did not have our phone. Finally, he finds it. Still not sure if we got everything. It was like a nightmare. I suspect that they may have a purpose to their bedlam. I wonder how many phones, etc. they end up with, after terrorizing the passengers going through. The agent then took us to a gate, and was ready to leave us when luckily I decided to verify that it was the correct gate. It wasn't. He said he was very sorry, and I do think it was an honest mistake. He then took us to the correct gate which was a long ways away. We would not have been able to walk it. The agent that pushed the wheelchair said that the woman at security was ""mean"" and was always like that, and was always attacking him. Is there no supervision at this major American airport? I noticed similar stories in many of the reviews. This was a very disturbing experience for my husband and I - both seniors. One would think there would be some kind of accountability.",-1
2022-10-17,0.1,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,even worse than Newark,True,"  Worst Airport in NYC - even worse than Newark. I’m so glad United is stopping service from JFK. I’d gladly trek to Jersey than go to JFK. The TSA employees are completely incompetent. There was a male TSA employee who told all the female passengers to stand on one side just because their female TSA employee wasn’t available for pat-down. Like as if most passengers need a pat-down? And even when she was available, he still asked us to wait on one side and let all the male passengers go through security. Also, only 3 food choices at Terminal 7. Expect a 20-30 min wait at a Dunkin Donut.",-1
2022-10-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,Avoid this place at all cost,False,"  Worse airport ever. Employees are rude, do not hesitate to yell at people for no reason. Have to go to TSA check again for a connecting international flight. Prepare yourself to wait in line for at least 1h. This is so unnecessary. If you bough any liquid (alcohol bottle, oil, etc) at the duty free of the previous airport, it will be confiscated by TSA. They yell at my 10 years old son for not being fast enough to put his bag into the bin. A TSA guy rudely told a lady in front of me who was not understanding what he was asking to her: ""are you really deciding to mot listen to me today!"". Avoid this place at all cost. I will never transit here anymore since it seems to be a chronic issues with no desire to fix it.",-1
2022-09-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,No signs giving directions,False,"  Horrible experience. No signs giving directions. If you took the most obvious route out of the baggage recheck area for arriving international flights, you ended up in a terminal where you had to go through security again. This was another nightmare. The place was full of CLEAR staff trying to get you to sign up so you could ""skip the line,"" Okay, that sounds like a good idea. On attempt to sign up, we saw we already were enrolled in CLEAR.  They're not going to get a commission or meet their quote with us, so they direct us to an area in the line. Only problem was they wouldn't let us enter the CLEAR line (I'm not sure there even was one as every time I have attempted to utilize this option, I have ended up in the line of cattle on the way to slaughter). The line was endless and no signage indicating the regular line from TSA precheck (which we had printed on our boarding pass). Upon finally arriving at the checkpoint, my traveling companion was severely reprimanded to not being in the precheck line. Believe me, she would have been if there had been one that could have been identified. Simply put, no directions, rude staff, no one in charge to direct traffic and alleviate a crowded situation that could have been lessened by a simple bit of organization and human decency all combined made this one of the most horrible experiences of my life. CLEAR is a joke, JFK is a joke and any travel through this airport has become the number 1 airport in the US to avoid.",-1

When we arrived very disappointed to find only desks for checking, no toilets, no shops, nothing. By going down two levels to the arrivals area we located a shop and a dunking donuts and toilets very poor. Once we got thought passport control great choice of stores and places to eat but at airport prices - can see why this airport is rated so bad.",-1

2022-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Shame on you, employees at JFK",False," What an awful way to begin a vacation. The employees, from weighing and checking our bags (scan didn’t work!) to having our id’s checked to going through security were nasty, rude, and unpleasant. They purposely mumbled and spoke so low that you couldn’t hear them and when you asked them to repeat they were SO COLD and NASTY. They looked miserable as if they didn’t want to be there. Then leave because you are making everyone else miserable! Robots would have been more pleasant. They barely looked at you and you were treated as sub-human. In contrast, the employees at CHS Airport we’re friendly, kind, and very pleasant. New York has a very bad reputation for being rude and disrespectful and JFK airport gives credence to this. I am ashamed that I live in a state where an airport is so horrific. I will no longer be taking flights from this horror of an airport. JFK employees should be fired and should be replaced with people who are happy and thankful to have a job in this precarious economic state. Shame on you, employees at JFK. You are a DISGRACE!",-1
2022-08-20,1.0,Couple Leisure,,,,4.0,,,,4.0,going above and beyond the call of duty,False,  I was picking up my husband from arrivals at New York JFK airport. I was very nervous he wasn't feeling well he has diabetes and the family was concerned that he wasn't going to make it home okay. While I was waiting in front of the b area at terminal 4 I encountered a gentleman named Kenneth Hendricks. This gentleman assisted me in a way that was not only very professional but very compassionate I told him my husband had a pink knapsack and showed him a picture and it took him a little bit but he found my husband asked him if he was okay and brought them to me. Now if that's not going above and beyond the call of duty I don't know what is I do believe Kenneth should be acknowledged for the good service he provided us as customers.,1
2022-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Worst experience with the security,True,"  Worst experience with the security control I have ever had. It is ok for things to go slow. But the staff were incredibly rude to 60% of the travelers. They expect all travelers to know the rules in and out like they do, which is impossible - especially because the signs with the rules are nok existing, or at least not easy to see. One of the staff were actually shouting to other travelers for not putting their bag correctly. It was actually very uncomfortable and I was not looking forward till it was my turn. Bad management. Bad staff..",-1

The staff is unprofessional, extremely rude (after missing our flight to LAX due to there being ONE slow security officer checking passports) and security, we changed our flight 2-3 times due to false information spread by the workers. The staff is so unfriendly, most of them on their phones. Not taking their job seriously, not willing to offer help or guidance, not doing anything at all.",-1

Awful service, awfully run and and frustratingly inefficient.",-1

The TSA workers in this terminal are the worst I’ve ever witnessed. Not only were they rude, disrespectful, and incredibly unfriendly, but they were throwing people’s belongings down the belt without even asking. It was also very unnecessary since people were pushing their bags down at a steady rate. When I asked why they were throwing my things, I was confronted by 2 TSA women who started arguing with me and saying “I was weird” I just don’t understand why they are allowed to get away with treating people like cattle… it’s TSA not secret service. Someone needs to address the issue that is constantly TSA employees attitude.",-1

2022-05-22,0.4,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,Chaos is evident everywhere,True," We have been to JFK sometime back, but the most recent experience are the worst. We returned from Barcelona to LAX with a stop at JFK. We were given a tag for express-lane to pick up our luggage, go through custom and TSA. Unfortunately, the TSA staff mixed up the regular travelers with those with the ""Express-Lane"" to make the connecting flight. The TSA staff and customs staff have all appeared to be uninterested in their jobs as if they wished to be elsewhere. Chaos is evident everywhere. As a result, we ran and were barely made it to our flight to LAX - 5 minutes before the take off time. As if, the misery and stress was not enough, our plane was delayed and waited to take off due to 60 planes in front of our plane. We would avoid this airport at all cost in our future travel plan.",-1
2022-05-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,,3.0,0.0,,3.0,,Security was even worse,False,  Simply terrible. Flew with AA and they had two counters open to check in and 200-300 passengers queing. All self check in desks were down and service was terrible. Security was even worse. Spent almost 2 hours to check in and get through security. After inspection there is little to no choice when it comes to eating. Literally two places which offered terrible options. I had to stand up at the gate since there are few steats (all of which were taken obviously).,-1

I cannot understand, that involved airlines put up with this circumstances for their passengers.",-1
2022-05-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,4.0,1.0,said that I had to leave the terminal,True,"  Arrived at JFK, terminal 1 around 11:30pm on the 8th of May, for the flight on the 9th. I laid myself down on the floor then I heard the voice saying that I was not allowed to ‘lie down on the floor.’ It was around 2am. So I woke up, and packed myself when the voice came up to me again to make sure. I moved on, looking for a bathroom and the voice called me again. She stopped me and asked where I was going. I said bathroom. She said that’s okay and told me direction to the bathroom, which was literally in front of me. She added that the Food Court was closed if I were to go there. First, I was not, and second, I knew it was closed anyway, but I did not bother to answer. After the bathroom, I started to looking for a new spot to sit down. Then I just thought that I might have a short breeze near the exit, but the door was closed. I waved my hand under the sensor once or twice then quit, and was about to resume my search for the chair. Then she ran up again and said the terminal was closed. I said I could see that, and asked her if she was following me. She said I was not allowed to roam around  the airport because the terminal was closed. But there were other people in the terminal! I said I was on my way to find a seat. She said I could sit anywhere, and I said I was on my way to the seat closer to my airline. She then said that I had to leave the terminal because my flight was to leave ‘tomorrow.’ It was 2:20am and my flight was 1pm, on the same day. She told me to leave immediately or she would call the police - she said it more than 5 times. I asked her what I was supposed to do, and she said I should leave immediately and come back after 6am. She blocking me with her body in case I go anywhere when I was not even moving. I hopped in the elevator as she said. I could see her calling someone with her wireless set to make sure I do not stay in the building. I landed on the 1st floor, with shock, horror and confusion. I tried to look up any hotels around the airport to go, but it took less than 30 seconds until the man, who got her call came up to me. He kindly advised me that the terminal 8 is open 24 hours. I asked him the direction, when she ran down to the first floor, cutting his words. She said “No, she’s not going to the third floor. Go out right here and walk across the street.” I said I would check with internet and she kept repeating that she would call the police. When I was waiting for the red light to change to green in front of the cross, I could see her watching me until I cross the street fully from inside. That was very creepy. It was 2:25am. Anyhow, I made it to the terminal 8, and guess what? There are so many people sleeping on the floor! Am I not allowed to come to the airport too early? I always thought that arriving in the airport earlier is always better than being late, but I guess this does not apply to JFK? I am just shocked and horrified that such a big international airport like JFK could kick an international guest like that manner.",-1

When we arrived it was really crowded and we had to wait for more than 2 hours to have our passport controlled standing in line for all the time. The signs were not put in the right place, which had lead lots of passengers in the wrong line and the staff was really rude, not giving explanations or right indications. Restroom was dirty and we had a really bad experience with almost everything.",-1
2022-05-02,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,the most horrific experience,True,"  Probably the most horrific experience in my entire life. I boarded my flight from terminal 8 of JFK where I arrived 3 and half hours before flight. The airport was terribly overcrowded. Where in the world domestic and international passengers are checking in at same kiosks? A handful of highly uncooperative staff was available to help herd! of passengers at self-check-in kiosks so, I could not get any help in spite of literally begging from 3 staff when I was not able to scan my wife passport. Finally, one staff told me to go another counter. After standing in Queue for half an hour I was told that I was at wrong counter and should go to other counter. After standing in queue at that counter for 15 minutes, I was told that I should fill the immigration form of Peru by scanning QR code from the machine installed at a point in airport. I and at least 10 of other passengers were struggling to connect to Wi-Fi of airport to scan the code. When I went to some staff to report this issue their straight answer was “this issue is not their problem” and when I said that I will miss my flight, unfortunately instead of having a word of sympathy the answer was “it’s not their problem”. Anyways, I kept on trying for next half an hour to finally connect Wi-Fi of airport to find that it was not the “immigration form” it was “health declaration form” which I had already filled. Airport staff should at least know the exact terminology and difference between immigration form and health declaration form. Anyways, finally I stand in a long queue to find that I was not the only one, majority of the people in that line who like me were about to miss their flight or had already missed their flight in spite of reaching 3 hours prior due to utter chaos, incoordination and red tapism. I requested at least 3 staff to consider me early but in vain. Finally, I reached at check in counter to find that there was 1 pound extra in one bag (while other 3 bags were short of 30 pounds) but still the lady asked us to open our lock and shift our load to another bag. While we were doing so, she went for short break. The misery didn’t end here, security staff opened the bag of my wife to remove creams, lotions etc. (which we were open and were sure less than 100 ml; moreover, we had crossed 3 airports before in other countries with the same stuff). When I requested them to please do it little fast otherwise I will miss my flight, their answer was again “that’s not their problem” Finally, we sprinted to reach our flight departure gate which was about to close in next 5-10 minutes. At gate I was told that my cabin baggage is oversized (the same bag approved by check in staff became oversize after reaching at departure gate!). Anyways, finally we boarded our flight after depleting all adrenaline and other stress hormones. My request from authorities is:  At least separate domestic and international departures. Increase staff to help passengers at web check in kiosks. Ask staff to be compassionate towards passengers. Just bluntly saying that it not their problem does not solve the problem rather disheartens you. Start feedback system of international passengers to understand their agonies. Do a survey to find that how many international passengers are missing their flights and then compare with other countries.",-1

The Airport itself was okay, but the staff is something else! From check-in to security to the stores, the staff were rude, unwelcoming, and disrespectful. On checking our luggage, they were systematically thrown onto the conveyor belt in front of our eyes. The security line was an absolute joke – here we had a couple of men who were shouting and barking orders at everyone and treated everyone as if they were incompetent. Security staff stood idly by and just watched as the security trays were becoming backlogged, thus creating more delays. I had to remove 6-8 of the trays myself in order to get the line moving. As to the staff within the stores and restaurants, well, a certain fast-food franchise should be ashamed of themselves. Have never been spoken so rudely in all my life. The staff of a certain fragrance store and Hudson News had no people skills whatsoever. They obviously didn’t want to be there.",-1

Arrived from Heathrow and needed to transit to Nashville - we had a three hour window. Long story short we missed our connection due to the chaos at immigration. Out of 60 booths at times two were manned and they said there was a computer glitch which meant no non-US passengers were being processed. We queued for over two hours. Nobody cared. Delta staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a later flight. We had dinner in T4 and it was cold and the power went out What a disgrace and a terrible introduction to the US.,-1

2021-10-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,This place is a disgrace,False,"  Me and my husband arrived several hours late from our JetBlue flight, from Mexico, because of a delay. We were in Mexico & were told by the attendants numerous times that it wouldn't be much longer, only 15 more minutes. Instead of telling anyone the truth they had us all waiting around for HOURS. This was along with numerous others. Finally we boarded & arrived at JFK around 11pm and were told by the rude attendant that there was not another flight until 9:30 am, because we missed our flight. We told her it was of no fault of ours or anyone of the many others who arrived late due to JetBlues issue. After telling her that we were waiting for our other flight from 1:40pm-6pm and that we had no where to go, she conveniently found a flight at 4:30am. Other guests were told the same thing and we're forced to book their hotel at the airport for the night. We then asked where we could go for the next several hours. She told us there was a lounge downstairs. When we got down there, there were already others sitting around, exhausted. We weren't there for long when the security guard told everyone that they couldn't sit in the lounge area, because they were going to clean it .. while all of us had no to go. My husband and I went back upstairs to find a bunch of people, families & small children, sitting, even laying all over the floor because nothing was open for anyone yet and there were no chairs. What is the point of having a large lounge area, with seating, when no one can use it? So now there are a bunch of customers just lying around, on the floor, exhausted, waiting for the gates to open. This place is a disgrace. No wonder why there are so MANY negative reviews. It's sad to see that Nothing is changing.",-1

2021-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,The bags were sitting there for hours unattended,False,"  I strongly believe there are very serious security lapses at New York JFK Airport. On Friday 27 Aug we arrived at JFK from an International origin as transfer passengers enroute to Washington DCA Airport. Our luggage was tagged from origin all the way thru to DCA. The luggage was off loaded from the aircraft and placed on baggage claim while we waited in line 2 hours to re-enter border passport control where only 5-6 agents were processing over 500 passengers, the employees handling the crowd could barely speak English and were extremely rude and unprofessional. Some airport employee placed our baggage at a transfer kiosk and left it sitting there unattended. There was an airport employee standing at a door doing nothing so we asked her why our luggage was just sitting there so long and she said someone would be there so we waited up to 30 minutes. The bags were sitting there for hours unattended because nobody would come and handle our bags and put them in a secure staging area for our connecting flight. We tried asking why and employees would just turn their backs and ignore us. We decided to take matters into our own hands and recheck our baggage at Delta Airlines Ticket counter. We just walked away from there with our bags and nobody said anything so there was “unaccounted for” bags now. After taking a tram and going up and down stairs to 3 different terminals we found an employee that placed our bags onto the incoming baggage belt where we hoped it would find its way to Washington DCA. We then took more trams to a shuttle bus which took us to another terminal where we went thru an absolute chaotic security without any instruction people were yelling pushing and shoving running and our Delta flight gate changed 3 times and was 2 hours late departing. Delta was late on our first flight and lost our bags at JFK and we got them 2 days later overseas while on vacation. It is impossible to navigate JFK because there are no maps and simple instructions for foreign passengers, you must ask one of the extremely rude barely English speaking airport employees who can’t explain the complexity of finding your next terminal. You will have to run everywhere because transfer is so difficult and time consuming and information is unavailable. This airport is also dirty, smelly and worn out old. I would be willing to pay much more money to avoid New York all together for my next International Flight but it is so hard any International flights in the central USA.",-1

There was nobody at Delta to help me and I was so scared because all my identification, medications, and my last paycheck were all in that bag. I was desperately looking for help. Then the sweetest man, an agent who checks boarding passes right before TSA, helped me. He was patient, calmed me down, was quick, efficient, and most importantly he actually found my purse. I know I got really lucky because it was the plane's last stop, but if I hadn't come across someone as kind I probably would have never gotten it back. I thank him and everyone who was involved in recuperating my purse from the bottom of my heart. You all could have chosen to take it, steal the contents, or just thrown it in the trash but everybody had a lot of good in them that night.",1

All NYC airport staff generally rank low in terms of attitude and manners. It isn’t uncommon to be greeted with a very confrontational service. On this occasion I had booked NYC as a family holiday and left by the end of the week feeling so upset. A woman and man working at security shouted at my and my family completely unnecessarily. They demanded we fold down our pram with my sleeping 1 year old baby in it and then shouted at us to get her out and the to move on immediately whilst other members of staff watched with complete indifference and smiled. It was a horrible horrible experience. They created an unbelievably tense and hostile environment, which the staff almost fed off. It was not the best holiday given an UBER driver demanded $250 after taking us from JFK to our hotel, and the hotel mixed our rooms up (the Maxwell on Lexington Avenue) Leaving 5 of us to share a double room for 5 days. All in all an awful experience made even worse by the airport staff.",-1

Despite queues out of the door and we were there for over 2 hours, staff could be seen chatting to each other between customers (not asking for next in line due to talking) and then taking an age to process, the whole time being very unfriendly and downright rude!

There is one PreCheck line and no separate ""CLEAR"" line. The ""CLEAR"" machine and staff are placed at the front of TSA PreCheck line, allowing CLEAR customers to cut through the PreCheck line. Really? CLEAR has higher priority than PreCheck? If so, TSA should announce it, so people can decide to buy CLEAR instead of PreCheck. I believe the CLEAR machines and staff should be placed at the end of PreCheck line or a separate area away from the PreCheck line, so when they are confirmed CLEAR, they can get in PreCheck line like all the other PreCheck customers. I suspect CLEAR pays TSA or the airport the get their program this unofficial advantage.",-1

I have never in my life seen an airport be so disorganised, the staff so so rude, and the lines for security were so long!! All over the world they do it so much better, JFK security is manned by power tripping morons! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and security (travelling with 5 of us, 3 children), and we missed our flight by 5 min! When we were going through security the rude arrogant lady opened every single present my children received for Christmas, opening up the toys with a screwdriver. They do this for phones, iPads, Nintendo switch! Why would they do it for a Harry Potter wand and a Star Wars droid, that I wouldn’t be surprised if it even works now, never been used! Why can’t the X-ray scanner see if there is anything inside it like all other luggage! My son was upset seeing her pull apart his droid which seemed to spur her on in her arrogance and self importance! My daughter who wears an arm brace for her recently operated on elbow gets patted down at each airport, not at JFK, they seem to think 3 different people should pat her down, then they stood there and argued about who is more important and who should’ve done it first! The arrogant self important lady who took a screwdriver to my sons toy, was more upset that she didn’t get to do the pat down than anything, taking pleasure in not only treating us and anyone around her with disrespect and contempt, but the staff that she works with as well! It took us 48min alone to just get through security. I respect the process, but it doesn’t need to be this unpleasant! After all of this the morons at security let through my sons medication which was 250ml of liquid and a pair of scissors (but thank goodness his Harry Potter wand was scrutinised for hidden things). I only know they let these things through because after missing our flight boarding (the plane was still there and the ramp just shut) we went to LeGuardia airport to wait with 3 children for 5 hours on standby and their security picked them up! But guess what, they just scanned the Star Wars droid and Harry Potter wand like any other airport in the free world. Shame on you JFK, clearly you need to invest in visiting first world airports in other major cities around the world, clone what they do, and then maybe you may measure up on the world scale! At the moment you fail dismally and are at the very bottom of the pile.",-1

I feel such embarrassment when I am in this airport as a New Yorker. I have been all around the world and I’ve never been treated so poorly in an airport or had to watch others treated so terribly. The staff seem untrained. They don’t treat anyone with dignity or even minimal respect. They are rude and abrupt and won’t assist those who are confused or in need even though customs and baggage claim is a mess and horrendously confusing. I have seen actual staff snap at people asking reasonable questions or for help, downright ignoring them while socialising with colleagues, elderly people asking for assistance to be ignored. The best you are treated is someone just doing their job and acting like you don’t exist. For example, taking your bag from you at recheck without a word, checking your passport but looking right through you like you’re not there without even a hello or smile or even a nod. I had a 5 hour layover and they didn’t manage to get my luggage to my next flight on Time. It’s such a sad, sad state. Positives are I had a wonderful waiter at a restaurant and they have water bottle refill stations. Also some decent shops. Just doesn’t make up for the other very upsetting bits and how uncomfortable I felt. Unfortunate as it’s such a great city, but avoid this airport at all costs.",-1

Staff prior to security, shouting and people and extremely rude to everyone, including cabin crew as they came through Security - indifferent towards checking the carry-on luggage at x-ray machine - failed to notice not only my daughters liquids which included a 250ml bottle of water and make-up/skincare she had forgotten she was carrying, but more worrying, did not notice I had a large metal tin of liquid pumpkin pie mix (500mls) (accidentally placed in my hand luggage and only noticed by me later on). Security staff in general at x-ray machines were rude, offensive, patronising and aggressive towards other passengers who did not understand English well.

The signs to direct people are very confusing which caused my husband to have to queue twice. I am still waiting for my husband as I write this! It took approximately 2hrs 20mins for me to get through passport control and dread to think how long I will be waiting for my husband. There are hardly any desks open and the whole of passport control is full. Absolutely disgusting as there are also young children queuing at 1am in the morning!

I have traveled all over the world and never experienced the delays in trying to get through security. Not only were they understaffed and under trained the two officials attending the screening area prior to being screen were the rudest and lacking total customer experience acted in the worst manner? There were numerous customers pleading to get through as we all were on the same flight and had 10 minutes before the door was closed on the plane and this is after being in line for almost 50 minutes! Never in my life have I waited so long and after numerous requests to let the people go through she completely lost control and screaming at us at and then decided to stop the screening process and send us back to the end of the line! I demanded her supervisor and she blatantly lied and said we were line jumpers. Thankfully after explaining to the supervisor he turned it back on to allow people to continue to be screened a young woman with two young children in front of us was so upset and distraught stead a total mess we were able to make the flight by running and with a couple of minutes to spare I’m in my late 60s as is my wife and we both have disabilities and if this is acceptable behaviour by staff at JFK and accordingly no apology was offered by anyone it’s a disgrace and obviously the women in particular who were on duty last night have no idea what so ever what it’s like to be put in that situation!! On the positive side the staff of Jetblue were amazing and kept the plane trip as comfortably as possible knowing that half the plane experience the check in GP,-1

Arriving at Jamaica Station well ahead of time we were informed the JFK Sky Train was not in service and shuttles were being supplied instead. We queued for 2 hours, amongst hundreds of other passengers as only 2 buses were sent. No JFK employees were available to update passengers what was happening throughout. Eventually being hoarded onto an over crowded bus which was supposed to be to the terminal, everyone had to get off and stand in the snow and raining for a further 20 minutes to transfer bus. Again no JFK employees were available to co-ordinate the situation. Having finally arrived and boarded the plane, we sat on the plane for 3 hours beyond our scheduled departure. With the captain stating no one at JFK Flight Control was able to be contacted - destining the situation like a ‘circus’. Several other flights were in the same situation. We have now missed connecting flights and face a 6 hour delay. A very poorly managed airport, with terrible communication and a clear lack of staff and coordination. Terribly run organisation, which I hope not to travel through again. Embarrassing showcase for New York City to worldwide travellers.",-1

2019-11-13,0.3,Business,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,security guard asked me to leave Departures,False,"  I was early for a flight at 08.05, 12th November 2019. Went up through security and sat by my gate. At 00.30, a civilian security guard asked me to leave Departures as it was more than 4 hours until my flight. This would mean leaving departures. Going to arrivals and re-submitting my luggage and self back through security. This may or may not be correct although the official website does suggest you are at the terminal at least 3 hours before international flights. Anyway the security guard, who was not rude, refused to identify himself by name or personnel number. I pointed out that I would neeed either for a complaint. He stated, 'just tell them security told you that had to'. I spoke to security downstairs, after going back to arrivals. Again professional, however, they said that complaint could not be made as I couldn't identify the guard. Firstly, I pointed out that, that was because he wouldn't identify himself. Secondly, he spoke to me at 00.30 approximately at gate 9, therefore, not an insolvuable problem. I spoke to the security ops and raised my concerns. If I am to admitted 4 hours before flight then that is now only 1 hour 15 away. Where am I supposed to go for that long? Instead arrivals is like, a not entirely clean, zombie movie. A pity most staff really good.",-1

Because she was walking unsteadily, we decided it is better that she be in a wheelchair. When we arrive at the security, she was asked to stand up. Trying to comply, she stood rather unsteadily. The immigration officer kept her standing for while. Another officer asked her to go in through another screen but this same officer scolded her and told her to stand there saying words to the effect, ""How many times have I got to tell you to stand there?"" When he finally deigned to let her go through the security screen, she found herself held up at the other side as two officer tried to find out if her plaster cast on her hand was real or not. ""It's real"" they concluded finally! We complained to the supervisor who was seated after that and she promise to take action. Whether she did or not we don't know. This is nothing but bullying and humiliating people who have visited the US to spend money and was unfortunate to have a fall. If this is how the US customs treat people I think there are many other countries we can go to. We have resolved not to go back to the US for a long time to come.",-1

You can compare it with the one of Cuba Havana with the only difference that there is WiFi, which was not working when we arrived. Security queues where really long when we arrived. All staff (except for 1 funny guy) was unfriendly and not helping customers. Temperature control was really awful. It switched from really hot to windy for a few seconds.

In the UK, where we are from, all shoes, coats and bags need to be loaded into trays so this is what we did. Suddenly we found ourselves being shouted at aggressively by a female security attendant who was angry that we hadn’t understood her barked orders to remove bags and shoes from trays. My young son was getting flustered as she was so aggressive in her manner (his first long distance trip) and so she sighed loudly, made some derogatory remark and then removed his shoes angrily from a tray and banged them onto the conveyor belt. Her behaviour was so rude and I politely told her so, whereupon she shouted “I’m not being rude. If you listened the first time there wouldn’t be a problem!” A second attendant then shouted at several of us for standing too close to the gate by the scanner. My sons and I were shocked by the aggressive and rude way we were treated, and other passengers expressed similar feelings. How on earth would people with learning difficulties or other frailties cope with this treatment?! Upsetting end to our holiday in the USA - made us glad to be getting back on a plane to the UK! Training is urgently needed to remind these people that travellers are human beings with feelings, who are paying a lot of money for their flights and who deserve to be treated with basic respect! After security we paid a lot of money for food that arrived cold and after a very long wait. Overall not a positive experience.",-1

My mother taught me to smile and say “please” and “thankyou”. Incompetent and inefficient setup; have they never seen how other international airports work? Please someone, go visit Changi or Haneda to see how to do it properly. On arrival, there was just one immigration officer for two full planes. Long lines of unhappy people ordered around like cattle. I’ve previously missed connecting flights due to extremely long wait times in immigration. On departure, surly staff are needlessly rude. Security is a joke with little understanding of the concept of flow. Terminal 7 is small with very basic amenities. I’ve travelled internationally every month for the last 25-years, and in my experience, JFK is one of the worst airports in the world. If first and last impressions matter, then JFK is a total fail and does NYC a massive disservice. Avoid if at all possible.",-1

I know that TSA will randomly open and check a bag which I have no problem with, however, I had 2 carefully packaged whiskey glasses from Hudson Valley Distillers which were missing. It is a shame when those who have the job of security cannot be trusted. The glasses were of very little value monetarily but a reminder of an otherwise wonderful trip. I was told a long time ago that you are only worth what you are willing to lie or steal for, in this case about $5, oh worthy individuals. Maybe TSA should make those who open a bag register and do so under camera surveillance. Who's the real security threat? Oct 19 Jetblue flight 161 from JFK to Sacramento in case anyone cares",-1
2019-10-19,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,3.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,the worst arrivals experience,True,"  This was the worst arrivals experience I have ever had. I have visited many airports, including some in developing African countries and JFK stands out from all of them. Standing in a queue for 2 hours (with 2 children) just to get through immigration is totally unacceptable. I thought maybe there were some staff on strike or something, but no, there just weren't enough staff - only about half of the counters were open. Why? When we finally got through our baggage was on the floor next to the carousel - it had had to be taken off so that the carousel could be used for another flight! None of the staff I asked could tell me why the queue was so long (when we were at the back and couldn't see what was going on). One lady, when I said ""excuse me, can you tell me what's going on?"" Just said ""No"" and carried on walking! Absolutely dreadful after an eight hour flight. My daughter went to the toilet after we finally retrieved our baggage and said they were disgusting. And when we got I to a taxi and told the driver where we needed to go, which was an airport hotel, he asked ""where is that?"" and I had to give him the full address! I hadn't realised London was such a paradise. I hope never to fly in to this airport again.",-1

The airlines say that they were on time so, it’s not their fault. Nobody will pay for a hotel until we can get on another flight to our final destination. All the staff in the airport were unhelpful, even the supervisor who advised us to come back to her after 30 minutes if we had not gotten to the security checkpoint. She just said we had to kept waiting, and, as a result, we missed our transfer. I used to like the USA. I now have no intention of coming back or spending any money on American products.",-1

2019-09-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,The experience was terrible,False,"  I was extremely disappointed in the customer service at JFK airport. I had numerous encounters where staff/individuals were unwilling to assist with questions, I was told different agents to see, multiple numbers to call, I was told to not step up to a counter without being “told” by agent and then told to step up and fill in gaps when there were gaps in TSA lines - I assimilated this experience with being a cattle in a barnyard - quite inhuman. The experience was terrible and I will go to great lengths to not fly through the airport in the future. Lastly the personnel gives your city and our nation a bad image for visitors and I hope you think about how to train staff in a more effective manner.",-1

Rude, incompetent staff who were scruffy, sour faced and unhelpful and who were screaming unintelligible instructions to confused passengers of all ages. Endless snaking lines, absolute chaos. I have travelled extensively and have never, ever seen such a disgusting airport and staff. (perhaps the exception here is La Guardia Airport) How can New York put up with this being the first impression international travelers get when they arrive in the United States? A disgusting experience all in all.",-1
2019-08-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this is an embarrassment,True," I’m almost speechless. For an international airport this is an embarrassment. We flew from Terminal 7 and I would recommend everyone avoid if they can. Filthy, cramped, disgusting toilets, and the limited selection of hugely overpriced and underwhelming food is laughable, particularly the utterly nonsensical ordering system which involves not one trip to a cashier but 3. WiFi impossible to connect to, very limited selection of shops to pass the time in & staff rushed and rude. I thought Frankfurt airport was bad but this is on a level if not worse.",-1

We arrived from Manchester and queued 1 and a half hours to get through immigration. After a 7 hour flight this really is not ideal. I witnessed one lady member of staff whilst directing people as to which queue they should go in, talking to and pulling facial expressions which were totally unacceptable. When we departed to go back to the UK I was absolutely appalled at the rudeness of one member of staff. We were taken 2 floors down to an alternative security area (due to the security area in departures being too busy). The organisation was ridiculous. One lady spoke to my 2 teenage sons in a totally disrespectful and rude manner. Totally uncalled for. She spoke to them like they were stupid - they are far from stupid. I am annoyed with myself for not saying anything at the time, however, I was stunned and also in the position of possibly affecting our ability to board the flight had I confronted her. The staff in this airport are rude.",-1

Terminal size is poky. No decent shopping. Will never return via this airport - amazed at such poor facilities servicing one of the busiest cities in the world. Once again food prices are a disgrace.,-1
2019-07-30,0.4,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,terminal to terminal is a hassle,True,"  I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse. If so, then heaven help the people who fly out of there!",-1

2019-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,never met staff as rude,False,"  Have never met staff as rude as they are at this airport! Arrived from London and was told by airline staff to go in the quick connect queue for our connecting flight to Orlando. A member of staff came over screaming at us that we were in the wrong queue, when I asked where we were supposed to go she just shouted “read the signs”. We ended up in a queue behind at least 50 people with one desk open. When it got to 15 minutes before our gate was due to close I asked several members of staff for assistance only to be ignored and told to wait. I managed to persuade fellow passengers to let me and my group go to the front of the queue. We then had to collect our luggage and go back through departures and security to get our connecting flight. When we got to the gate it had been changed last minute and was in a different terminal. Running around the terminal trying to find a screen with the correct information was like a scene from Hone Alone!!! We then had to get a bus over to the new gate. I fully expected to have missed the flight however we were lucky in that the flight had arrived late. We got to the gate just as it was closing. Thankfully just in time. This airport is totally disorganised and probably the worst airport experience I’ve had. I wouldn’t fly here again.",-1

This airport is absolutely disgusting, however, I must admit that customs and TSA were good, and I actually found them polite. However, as for the rest of the airport, Delta is horribly rude, the restaurants are disgusting and the baggage carts are a total rip off, a scam, charging $6.00 for the use of them, and on top of that they scream at you, in Toronto there is no charge. Then I get to Seattle and Alaska and people are polite and helpful. Going through JFK you feel as if you're going through another dimension.",-1
2019-07-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,is a third world airport,False,"  As others have said, this is a third world airport. Avoid at all costs. The reason for this is the rudeness and total ineptness of  staff you come across. It seems that to wear a uniform at JFK airport turns that person in to someone who thinks they are head of the Military or Police. Let me tell you something, you can still be nice to people. YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year. I am assuming they are still happy staff down there because, well, it's Florida. JFK staff could learn a lot from other countries where people love their jobs.The UK, Spain, France, Netherlands, Czech, Germany, South America, Australia, the list is endless.",-1

The heat was horrendous. Little children, babies and elderly people were all standing for hours in horrendous heat. Around half the booths were unmanned. There were few staff to help and signage showed that this was a regular occurrence. The whole place was scruffy, chaotic and a truly shameful introduction to a great nation. All Americans should be outraged that the management of this atrocious facility are providing a shockingly bad first impression of their nation. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Africa and can truly say this was my worst ever introduction to a country that really couldn't care less about the impression it gives to visitors.",-1

It was 3 pm on a Monday and it looked like every international flight had just landed. Utterly packed at customs with countless snaking, endless lines. No rhyme or reason what kiosk you went to. No order to the queuing. Airport staff just awful, not directing. Waited in line for 1.5 hrs. Then after finally getting through this horror, no directions to connecting flights, hardly any tv screens for departure gate times, they don’t tell you the terminal attached to the gate, so we wound up walking to gate B51, which was endless from customs. Totally antiquated, third world calibre airport. Shocking to see this in NYC. It needs to be demolished and rebuilt from scratch. Barely any seats at crowded terminals gate, hardly any eateries, awful.",-1

Apron arrival of the baggage claim, we were met with bad service and poor customer service. After waiting for an hour for our flight we went to the baggage service area. The workers obviously had better things to do, as it took them another hour to contact their manager. When they finally came, she just sat in the office typing away not helping us or giving us any updates except for saying that they were in fact loaded onto our plane and taken off, but they are unable to figure out where they were. I am on my way to a safari in South Africa, and was already pressed for time. There were two other people waiting there with us who had the same problem. I guess that paying for priority doesn’t mater because, in the end, we still lost our luggage. The moral of the story here is be cautious when flying and try to avoid Delta Air Lines.",-1
2019-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,This is the worst service ever,True," Today, I had a very unpleasant experience at JFK Terminal 5 with TSA JetBlue. There is an older TSA who was standing there flexing the line. I informed him that I have 10 minutes before my plane leaves, is there any way to get assistance. I informed him that my family was actually all the way in the front and that I was behind because I had issues with my luggage. I repeated myself several times and he just kept on looking at me and shooing me away. This is extremely unprofessional as I am a manager myself. This is not the type of customer service they should be providing even though he is a TSA member. When I arrived to the check point, I informed another member that wasn’t part of TSA, she had gave me the same inappropriate manner. She said “I can’t do anything, stay in line”. This is the worst service ever. I hope senior managers can coach their employees here at this airport. This can ruin an individuals experience.",-1

The camera would not capture my wife's picture she was too short, then it rejected my fingerprints and we ended up in the manual queue. This all took an hour and a half and our bags had been dumped off the carousel by the time we arrived. On our return to come home we had arrived in one part of T4 and had to take a bus to the other part but did not have to redo security, the gates at T4 were crowded and not terribly clean.",-1

It has a stupid, hard to figure out layout. I had to walk through the rain to change terminals. The gate areas were small and confusing as well. Then when I returned through customs and had some duty-free merchandise I was treated very rudely by a tsa worker in security and had some of my merchandise confiscated even though it was duty free and not brought from outside the airport! This is ridiculous and the worker was a complete jerk about the situation. I consider myself an understanding and patient person but this airport tested both!",-1

Upon arrival from the UK my family and I had to go through customs. I do not attribute the experience at customs with JFK but it was pretty bad as well. The customs officer was extremely rude and acted put off by being there. Once I got to security I realized we were precheck, yay for us right? I was told that we didn't need to take our shoes off by the officer checking our passes. Then we were yelled at by the lady at the scanning belt that we had to take out shoes off, then she yelled at us for putting our carry on bags in the bins (I don't want my bags on the dirty belts), she continued to roll her eyes while yelling at us.

This is the first and sometimes only American operation thousands of international travelers see every day, and y'all should not be proud. I need to use the restroom, there is urine on literally every toilet seat, can't imagine the last time this place was cleaned. The plug is so old and used it can't hold my laptop plug in place, I'm having to keep my leg against it right now to keep my laptop charging. The wifi I kid you not is not allowing me to stream Pandora, a music service. This is 2019 folks, come on this is a first rate embarrassment for an American airport.",-1

I was hoping it had improved since my last visit 4 years ago but I am afraid it was a shambles. The new esta system supported by self inputting machines make things worse and even then you still have to go through an interview with immigration. The hall was overwhelmed with people and staff who are very stressed and rude. I’ve been to four other American airports from the uk and this one exists from the dark ages. America you are letting yourself down. It’s a disgrace. We will not come back and I heard numerous other travellers saying the same thing.,-1

Total confusion and lack of clarity with no clear signage placed in the right positions is responsible in my opinion. The staff are abrasive and constantly shouting unclear instructions at the top of their voices. Long queues make for a very long wait together with the niggling doubt that you may be in the wrong queue because there is no clear signage or instruction. This was my first visit to New York, although not to the US, and my first impression of this city is one of very unwelcoming and rude customs staff. I have not experienced this at any of the other US airports I have arrived at. Surely someone needs to sort this out - perhaps management needs an overhaul. It seems ironic that the US prides itself on its customer service so what’s gone wrong here?",-1
2019-04-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,sorry treatment,True," JFK confirmed again today why it is my least favorite and most avoided airport. If it weren’t for the competitive international fares I’m able to acquire due to routing through this airport, I’d never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the “pleasure” of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one. Or maybe you, too will take away the degrading experience that was mine today. By the way, airport staff are warm and friendly with each other, even as the passengers they serve are wearily (and angrily) working their way through JFK’s cattle call process.",-1

We had to suffer over 2 hours of queuing in passport control which is totally unacceptable. We were penned in “cattle lines” for the duration. A total lack of staff and information. On exiting to the luggage carousel we couldn’t see a carousel with our flight on it. After walking about with no help or advice from staff we found our luggage lying in a pile in the corner. Things improved on the return as there was adequate staff. I will not use JFK again!,-1
2019-03-31,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,food is terrible,False," JFK, terminal 1 - don’t go there if you are hungry, food is terrible even for airport standards. I have been through many airports in my life. Staying in terminal 1 in JFK is one of the worst experiences for a long time. Had “dinner” at The Local - The food was worth a -2 star (minus 2) - had one bite of a burger and left the rest of the really overpriced food. I have never tasted something so bad and non prepared, not even ketchup could save this. Looking at the other restaurants and the ratings I can only imagine how bad they are as well. Not a single one have more than 3 stars and most are closer to 2 stars. JFK, JFK - what are you thinking having these bad restaurants? Is it on purpose, you would like a perfect vacation ending badly? It really feels like you do not care at all. The customer potential is huge, so why having all these non quality “restaurants”? To be honest I am amazed that “The Local” even have a license to serve food. For sure I will not put a cent in this terminal in the future. JFK, wake up now.",-1
2019-03-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Horrendous experience,False,"  Horrendous experience. I’m actually writing this as I’m stood in queue to get through passport control. So far it’s been a 1.5 hr wait with what I estimate to be another half hour at least till we actually get to the front of the queue. There is only 2 desks on (1 disabled and 1 able bodied) despite there being over 60 kiosks within the floor. We have a connecting flight to Las Vegas which I doubt we will actually make and there have been no apologies from staff in the slightest. There are no clear signs anywhere except throne at the start of the long snaking queue to say it would take 35 mins (which means that it’s now out by over an hour). Not a staff member in sight. Horrendous customer service with no professionalism. I can’t see any toilets and I am so thirsty it’s ridiculous. No refreshments. As I take over 33 pills a day for my illnesses I often need a drink as I get a dry mouth. No common courtesy given to anyone visiting this supposedly customer service friendly country. This isn’t at all about safety, this is purely down to an incompetent management. My advice - sack them all and start again! Terrible start to the holiday, was planning on visiting NYC with my daughter this coming February but definitely rethinking this after our experience today. Never known anything like it! I’ve attached photos of the queue (now 1hr 50 mins in) and the empty booths so you can see how inept staff are at making sure customers are dealt with swiftly and securely. This review wouldn’t allow me to leave a zero score as it’s needed a minimum of 1 star however if up to me then it would be a minus score. Take my advice fly into any other airport other than this one!",-1

The security check was very long, we had to wait about 30+ mins to get through and the queue wasn’t even that long. They had stopped and searched a woman and because they didn’t have any other woman officers, none of us women waiting could go through until they found what was setting off the alarm on her, again adding to the wait. The conveyer belt is the shortest I have seen which means all the baggage piles up until you are through the security check. Their website is wrong and they have very limited, over priced food options available which are limited to burgers or burgers or have I mentioned burgers! As a vegetarian and health conscious person this really has set me off on the wrong foot for our journey home. The shopping options again, are very limited and quite frankly equals to or even worse than a local small airport. I’ve heard BA had “invested” in the airport to make it better. I fear to think how it must have been before.",-1
2019-03-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a long haul travellers nightmare,False,"  Honestly I would rarely review an airport but I was shocked at how truly awful this airport is. It’s a long haul travellers nightmare. This service would simply not run in the UK- it makes our busiest airports in London look timid by comparison. First off if you’re catching a connecting flight through here good luck, the airport is huge and it is not clear where you’re supposed to be going. Not great when this is your first time here. I was stood in a customs queue that wound on forever until I got panicky my connecting flight was in 40 mins. I stepped out to inform them and they told me to ‘go over there’. I wander over to a desk and a rude lady asks what I’m doing and I need to scan my passport first - well sorry the man did not tell me that! Wouldn’t it be helpful to tell me? They start whispering in another language and exchanging looks as if this isn’t an airport where new people enter every single day. I’m not thick thanks. Then comes the icing on the cake - the ever so fun customs lady who dragged her feet over to man 1 of 2 customs desks. She tells me she needs to sit down first and takes as long as possible with an attitude. Sorry I know the job is stressful but suck it up lady. Then she starts getting really intimidating telling me I’m not stood near the camera enough and I’m telling her sorry I’m flustered as I need to catch my flight. She seems totally unsympathetic and continues being rude. Sorry but I just got off a 7 hour flight from Manchester and I had 30 mins to get through security and to the gate - excuse me if I’m a little disoriented by your awful airport! She then makes me scan both my hands at least 11 times and it was very clear she was doing it to toy with me. I mean seriously who employs these people. Luckily I kept it together to avoid trouble but I have never met such rude airport staff in my life! I’m so glad I wasn’t travelling to NYC because boy what a welcome to that city. I know New Yorkers are known for being brash but they were just simply obnoxious and unprofessional. Boy was I glad to get to LAX in sunny California where the staff were lovely and helpful. I’ve never been particularly interested in NYC and it’s -10 weather as it seems like a more aggressive version of London and this airport just confirms my opinion on the place.",-1
2019-03-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2 out of all of the booths were actually manned,True," Our flight landed slightly early around 11am, we got to the immigration hall and stood in a queue which didn't appear to be too bad, however, we then realised that only 2 out of all of the booths were actually manned. Every so often one of the people manning the booth would walk away for about 5 minutes leaving just one booth open. It was taking an average of between 3 and 5 minutes per person going through immigration. There were other staff members wandering around but nobody seemed to take charge. It took us around 2 hours to get through this fiasco but by this time the queue was about 4 times bigger than when we arrived and one of the booths was about to close because the lady was going for lunch. I dread to think how long it took those poor people to get through. I was absolutely amazed that in a country renowned for its customer service, this was allowed to happen - where were the management, or at least somebody to take charge and get additional staff in.",-1

A nightmare after a 16 hour flight! Once out of the plane immigration procedures were next. A huge and extensive hall with plenty of booths but only one was open. One officer for 4 wide body aircrafts. Where are all the officers? Sleeping, chatting, taking a break? Welcome to the service desert called USA. Any questions raised are replied like you are a criminal, rude and agressive. Overall that gives any arriving visitor a good impression of what to expect within this snobbish and rude country. Try to avoid whenever possible. B.t.w., lack of immigration officers is common. At another time I experienced that 2 out of 53 counters were open.",-1

We were 4 hours early for a flight and just made it on time because of the very long queue both for check in and through security. Staff were extremely rude! In fact I saw a member of the public ask a member of staff if she worked for the airport as she needed help and the staff member simply said 'no' even though she was wearing a uniform and clearly on duty. She just couldn't be bothered to help! Unnecessarily stressful and the worst organization I have ever seen.,-1

On arrival the staff were hostile (mainly the women) and in departure I overheard one security woman telling her colleague that people are “scared of her” to which she found this to be very amusing, another shouted orders in the face of an old woman telling her to pick up her tray off the floor, she was very intimidating and would have been better suited to working in a prison than in an airport. I was disgusted at this and how these people are a representation of your country, something needs to be done about the way they approach and interact with passengers. Most of the security were stood around in large groups talking and one women was whining about how she hated being theirs and wanted to go home. It was a horrible experience.",-1
2019-01-26,0.9,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,experience was quite positive,True," On Delta Airlines I flew out of Terminal 2 and returned through Terminal 4 for a domestic trip. The terminals differ enormously by size- Terminal 2 is very much smaller and very compact. Terminal 4 is huge with many stores and eateries requiring a lot of walking to and from your gate. On departure, I was surprised at the virtually non-existence security line. The gate areas have large glass panels and high ceilings. Lots of seating with electric power points. Quite a few eating places - including a Wendy’s - for a terminal with less than a dozen gates. My first time in Terminal 2 and highly recommend it. Delta had staff at the terminal entrance to assist you. Terminal 4 was very busy and required a long walk out from my gate. Just outside Terminal 4 is dedicated space for Uber and such service cars to come to pick up clients - this is very convenient. In short, my experience was quite positive and was very pleased with Terminal 2 especially.",1

He said “the taxi is waiting for you.” It was a black SUV. I told him “this is not a taxi “. He replied that it was an UBER and it was cheaper than a taxi. I have taken taxis before and it was around $60. This driver told me I had to pay $8.50 in tolls. Talked the entire time telling me how hard he works and only makes $10 an hour. Takes me to my destination and asks for cash and charges me $160 for the ride and then asked for a tip. My fault for being stupid!! Take a yellow cab!,-1

This was one of the most unorganized airports I’ve been in. I arrived way early and spent the entire time standing in lines. I was ultimately herded to a line for babies and handicap which merged with another line, when babies and handicap should have been in one separate line. I will never fly out of this airport again. Also, it is too far from Manhattan.",-1
2018-12-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,Basic human decency could be exercised,True," 
Terminal 1 had the rudest staff I've ever encountered throughout any airport in the world. Completely unnecessary the way they talk with people. If you work at an international airport expect people to not speak English, yelling at them and talking down to them is not going to speed things up. I am not sure what the training procedures are for this place, but for any establishment to allow their staff to talk to their guests like this is wrong. Reading other reviews I am not the first to experience this. I am not sure who is running this place, but just because you are airport security doesn't give you the right to be a complete jerk to anyone. Basic human decency could be exercised even minimally and it would be a drastic improvement. Food selections are scarce and the place isn't exactly clean. Restaurant staff were friendly and prompt especially for the amount of business.",-1

As well as the woman doing the scanning yelling at my young son for having water and not removing jackets after a meer secound. Honestly people incarcerated are treated better.

",True," We had our return flight from terminal 4. While looking for where to queue for security (very poorly placed signs), one airport staff member called us and asked for our boarding passes. My husband asked him if the queue was for economy passengers (because the sign read for first and business class passengers only), this person replied ‘I am not here to answer your questions, show me your boarding pass’, taken aback by his rude reply my husband opened the bag to take out the passes, then this man started shouting ‘Don’t hold the line’ again and again in the most disrespectful manner possible. All this shouting and rude language was in the presence of our 4 year old child. Finally, we were in queue for security check. He was, without doubt, the most disrespectful staff member we have ever encountered having travelled across Europe, Asia and America. He needed training on usage of basic words like ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. Avoid this airport if possible. We have head of similar experiences from others and negative comments about behaviour of staff at this airport. They should take tips from British airport staff.",-1

",False,"  Arrived 2.5 hours early. When we got to the check in desk we were told we had to get our hand luggage 'cleared'. This is prior to check-in. The line took 45 minutes, and then we were told that our hand luggage was too big and heavy. The bags were even ligher than when we traveled to the US. Ridiculous. Had to pay 100$ per bag after standing in another line for 1 hour. When we got angry, the JFK staff removed 100$ from the total. Which means it’s all utterly rubbish fees from the beginning. We traveled with Norweigan and I will never in my life fly with them or pass JFK again. The staff treat passengers as cattle. If travelling from/to Sweden, book SAS. It’s worth every dollar to travel with an airline who treats you respectfully - and used Newark instead. We got to JFK 2.5 hours early, and we nearly missed our flight.",-1

Customs was under staffed and funneled the passengers from other flights to accommodate the overload into very crowded checkpoints. In all fairness, the process worked satisfactorily-just very much slower. We had KTN's (Known Traveler Numbers) through the TSA (Transportation Safety Administration), but the agents in Terminal 2, after pre-check, though polite, were very invasive and unapologetic during personal scanning/'patting procedure'. It was excessive! The Delta Sky Harbor Lounge was off limits to us because we did not have American Express Gold, Platinum, or Titanium credentials! It was the third such lounge in our itinerary and it failed! The staff seemed tired and aloof. The other two (Air France in Terminal 5 ORD and Alitalia in FCO) lounges in the Delta network were AAA+ Very confusing exiting terminal 1 to get to terminal 2 at JFK.",1

Departing from terminal 5 with my four children was going well, got through security without a problem. On our way to the Aer Lingus lounge in the terminal my youngest son and I stopped for a moment to check information when all of a sudden an airport staff member pushing a lady in a wheelchair almost ran into us with no warning or ""excuse me"". As I am an extremely polite person I quickly moved with my son and said sorry twice for being in the way, this staff member could very easily have gone around us anyway. As soon as we moved we didn't get a basic thanks instead this ""man"" called me an idiot in front of my son. This experience tainted my flying from JFK and annoys me to have been subjected to such ignorance and uncouth behaviour, in my opinion there should a complaints procedure which could highlight cases such as this. Staff lacking in basic people skills should be taken in hand and penalised.",-1

I have travelled to airports around and have never experienced such poor customer service and disorganisation. I have just finished queing at security control for just under 3 hours with no apology whatsoever. No one cares. I did this with my mum who has hip problems. The staff were slow and inconsiderate.

The queue was long and slow and we waited patiently but when we got to the desk the staff member was so rude shouting at us to hurry up. Then when we stood as a family together (me my husband and two small children) he treated me with such an awful lack of respect. Using his temporary position of power to rest my reaction as he knew I couldn’t be rude back to him! He was such a bully. Very awful experience in front of my children. I wish I had taken his name as this boy needs to be taught a lesson, but I get the impression it’s a culture at the border control. An awful initial impression of the USA.",-1

The system was outdated, disorganised and inefficient. Once at passport control the equipment used to take fingerprints didn’t work meaning we had to spend another 20 minutes waiting in a back office. On our return journey to London we found the staff at JFK check in and security rude and unnecessarily abrupt. The departure lounge was small, outdated, worn, dirty and lacked shops and choices of restaurants.

Departing at 2:50 in the afternoon, I found the security line to be relatively uncrowded. The bins on which we place our belongings to go through the X-ray machines are equipped with a sensor to detect suspicious items. My carry on was pulled off because it triggered a flag. It was opened but nothing was found. I spent an hour at the American Airlines lounge before the flight. Large windows looking out. A good spread of food and a wide range of self service drinks were available. Couches spread out that were comfortable and often offered privacy. Good place to wait before the flight. Lots of stores and eateries. Departure gate was crowded. An end gate, the area had shops and building pillars which together with many seats left little space to form queues prior to boarding. On return, plane arrived around 3 pm. A short walk to the immigration area. There were no lines. Used a machine to read the passport and presented the printout to the officer at his stall. No stamping in passport. With no checked baggage, I walked out to the arrivals hall and called a Uber car which arrived in 4 minutes. In less than 10 minutes from getting out of the plane, I was leaving the airport grounds. More often than not, I have found Terminal 8 a very pleasant and easy place to use and this time was no exception. Airport staff are helpful and signage are ample.",1

We landed at 13:10 and cleared customs, collected luggage and in a cab by 14:00! The ground staff were firm in their approach but certainly not rude, and helped with re-directing passengers into the appropriate lanes to allow quicker clearance. Again on return from T4 at JFK no big queues, staff pleasant and only took 40 mins to check in and make way through security.

Waiting by Gate B55 is excruciating as there is a defective piece of equipment that makes a constant metal scraping noise that no one seems to care about.

Got off the plane and took a photo of Lady Luck looking forward to our holidays after 12 hours of travel just to get here. Walked towards baggage claim and into passport control. We got in line and only one person dealing and then the wife noticed the 60 min wait time. One stroppy woman was barking at people to get in a certain line but none of it was clear to us. We don't live here. After 30 minutes the wife asked this rude lady about our line she mentioned as if we should have known thate we have an ESTA visa having been here in 2012. She told us, shouted at us to get in another line ESTA is valid for 10 years. We got in this new line relieved we might be out of here faster than we thought. The line she put us in reached a dead end. I walked sideways to grab another ladies attention whilst trapped in this belt system and she said go this way, pointing at anything she could, so dragging two heavy cases that's what we did to reach another dead end. I was losing it by now, tired and wanting to get to the hotel plus our suitcases were going round and round the baggage claim and could be nicked. I grabbed another bloke and he says use the machines. I put my passport in and it took my photo then said try again so I did. This time it gave me a print out that meant nothing to me so ""now what"" I thought. Wife put her passport in and her print out had a huge cross on it. What does this mean? We got to another passport control and he says you have to be manually processed but mine was ok. We both went back in yet another line and the people in front also from the UK said great welcome to the USA is it not. We slowly get through the queue and the pillocks who work here were of no help and not interested in helping. By the time we picked our cases up and got to the hotel by cab just 30 mins away it had taken four hours from landing the plane. What a useless outfit, just do not care at all. We pay their wages and these buffoons would not like it if it happened to them Training must be so bad here or non-existent. My advice is don't use this airport. Boston on our way home was perfection and we got through security etc in less that 20 minutes tops. We landed at Heathrow last Saturday and was out within 20 mins tops.",-1

Waited half an hour after landing for gate to open for us. The shuttle took twenty minutes to get us to terminal B, which stopped for a while in the middle of the tarmac for no visible reason a couple times. Terminal B is neglected and sparse. Where even are the trash cans? Where are the water fountains? You have to walk quite a ways to find a directory just to see if it's worth walking even more. Very little seating, few and far between shops and eateries. If you want to pay too much and wait way too long for a fast food burger, hit up Shake Shack. And if you want to do homework or read, too bad cause a football game is blaring at your gate. Your gate which has changed three times since you arrived two hours ago. I may dare even say Newark's terminal A is better.",-1

",True, We've just returned to the UK via JFK airport after a few days visit. Upon arriving - the queues for passport control were thoroughly ridiculous. Total time taken to proceed through immigration was well over an hour and a half plus a the time added for queuing before you get close to passport control. The whole arrivals experience is very unintuitive for passengers. When going to passport control you're greated by shouting staff who seem to only confuse matters more whilst being pretty rude to travellers throughout the process. Upon departing JFK - the queue for the security area was ridiculously long. Staff again shouting and being pretty rude to customers in general. Very disorganised and lots of staff around not seeming to be doing anything particularly useful. There just seemed to be a total lack of organisation and planned way of ensuring a flowing an intuitive experience for travellers with staff instead left to sort through the chaos as best they can. Pricing and quality of food and beverages on offer. Firstly I know all airport are expensive. JFK is ridiculously expensive - it's literally like management went round with a clipboard and said how can we screw our customers for every fine and give them the least in return. The food we had from the noodle bar was atrocious - $46 for soup and a couple of scoops of curry. Avoid purchasing food at this airport or anything for that matter. Clearly being run by accountants with no vision for experience and repeat customers. Rude disenfranchised staff. Poor unintuitive experience for travellers. Signage is very poor with just shops and dining wrote on the signs above walk ways instead of which shops etc. This means customers have to walk all over this place and it's a lottery if you have gone the right way to find what you're looking for i.e type of restauarant or shop. Overall security and immigration operations are very disorganised. Staff members are rude throughout the entire process. Avoid this airport if you can and go to one that values your custom and wants to provide you with a good experience.,-1

Immigration in T4 went well through electronic terminals. Security in T4 was reasonably fast, but the staff were extremely rude. I was selected for a full body scan, I did not realise I still had my boarding pass from LHR in a pocket and the operative screamed at me 'I told you take everything out of your pockets'. I had been picked for a random full search Heathrow and the staff were a model of courtesy and politeness, JFK could learn a lot of lessons from them on how to do it. The transfer Jitney from T4 to T2 is dismal, poor signage and totally disinterested staff and filthy old bus. T4 must be one of the most depressing terminals I have had the misfortune to visit. When you enter you are hit by a wall of hot oil cooking smells from the fast food outlets. The access into the Delta Skyclub is up a staircase in front of a fast food outlet, through a cloud oil fumes. The lounge smelt just as bad.",-1

",False,  While on layover at JFK my daughter and I had a 5 hour flight delay. She is a celiac and must eat gluten free. There are no restaurants with allergen menus. The Asian restaurant in our concourse didn't even have gluten free soy sauce which is a common item. After traveling through Ireland and finding gluten free options available in most of the villages and in all restaurant in large cities I find it appalling that an international airport wouldn't require their restaurants to have a few gluten free offerings. For my daughter this is not a choice but a medical necessity. We had no problems other than that.,1

One CBP Officer for about 400 arrivals. When I asked why I was informed it was shift hand-over time. Two and a half hours later three more CBP Officers arrived which must be the longest shift hand-over anywhere in the world. During that time no public announcements were made despite elderly and young suffering in the heat without water and no seating. Not sure if the CBP Management are incompetent, inefficient, disinterested or just lack the basic understanding of supply and demand concepts. I have never seen such a long 'special assistance' queue and the airport management team should be ashamed of themselves.",-1

No staff, huge (2 hour) queue for immigration, a passenger literally abandoned in the corridor in a wheelchair (rescued by another passenger). Outdated terminal. The list goes on. Taxi queue ridiculous. Landed at 7:30, left the airport at 10:30. British Airways needs to sort this out if they continue to fly their customers here. Not a great start to a NYC trip!",-1

I requested a patdown and had to wait around 15 minutes for a TSA agent to do that. He told me in advance how he intended to search me and went on to do just that. The examination felt a little rougher than it did the last time I received a patdown five years ago. This was probably the TSA's enhanced patdowns that were implemented in 2017. Also, since my belongings were separated into four bins, the agent stacked the bins on top of each other without regard for their contents. So my heavy backpack was stacked on top of my laptop. Fortunately, the laptop survived.",-1

Through no fault of our own, our connecting flight between JFK and Orlando was cancelled, and there ensued the most horrific experience of apathy and downright rudeness from the staff at JFK. We were left wandering up and down this hostile environment with nobody willing to offer us help as we faced a night with nowhere to sleep, due to hotel rooms being completely full. What on earth happened to security? Even on these grounds, nobody stopped us. We have been left with a less than positive impression of JFK, and would strongly suggest that if you’re left in the unfortunate position of needing a connecting flight, avoid JFK!

Following an excellent flight with British Airways, my family of 11 and I arrived at JFK airport, in order to get our connecting flights to Orlando. We were looking forward to our 2 week holiday. Unfortunately, our flight was cancelled due to an electrical storm, we believe. We were directed from one end of the airport to the other, trying to find a resolution. We were met with disdain and utter rudeness. We were not even offered a glass of water, never mind a hotel accommodation. My family and I had to go through security on 3 occasions, we had to grab some sleep on the floor. Nobody helped us. We were horrified by the lack of support we received from the great USA. You would think that 11 people wondering up and down the airport would have attracted some attention? We lost a day of our holidays and we would never recommend travelling via JFK to anyone. Our experience was appalling and would never wish that on anybody else!!",-1

Extremely off putting experience, this airport has implemented new technology but it has not successfully reduced wait times or enhanced customer experience. Unfortunately it looks like a commercial decision taken to reduce staff levels and cut jobs. At least the machines aren’t rude though like the few staff available.

JFK air traffic control had us sitting on tarmac for 5 hours. Sending pilot mixed messages every 15 mins, babies crying, people needing to use the restroom but couldn’t get up because we were techically waiting to depart. Our plane was behind 38 others to depart. The weather was fine when we boarded but turned severe around hour 3. As a result we missed our connection and had to spend 53 hours in air and other airports to get to Africa. None of our seat purchase upgrades were honored and we missed the first day of our tour. Also was sitting on tarmac with earlier flight for an hour. JFK air traffic control manages inbound and outbound flights poorly. If you can avoid this airport please do.",-1

I think the two most galling aspects of TSA generally are a complete lack of urgency, unless they are shouting instructions at visitors and a propensity to have casual conversations amongst themselves. I appreciate that security is important but the collection of taxes on air tickets should mean that all these waiting passengers should be providing sufficient revenue to staff the booths adequately. More generally, I think the term ""customer"" has lost its meaning in many aspects of air travel. It's now often synonymous with ""inconvenience"".",-1

They canceled our flights yesterday due to bad weather even though skies were clear in both my departure and arrival cities. I believe the airport does this on purpose so that they can price gouge for the surrounding rental cars and hotels. The rental car place expressed to me that it is supply and demand and that when the airport does that they raise their rates accordingly because they know people will still rent I believe that is unacceptable and should be illegal for price gouging. I would rather fly by paper airplane than to fly in or out of JFK!,-1

I don't mind flying into JFK but driving in to pick up my wife and her friend was terrible. The security woman at the arrival area at the terminal walked over to my car and started yelling at me to move. I explained to her that my wife was walking to the car and I could see her and the woman still made me drive around the loop and come back. When I couldn't pull away from the curb because I was blocked in, she asked me if I thought she looked stupid and if I knew how to drive a car. Just a terrible woman with a terrible attitude. There was no reason to start a confrontation when she could have politely asked me to move or let me sit where I was for another 15 seconds after I pointed out my wife.",1

I have given up on Miami because the immigration make it so hard for all passengers coming from Latin Countries, although I carry an Australian passport and am 77 years old. LAX is too difficult for elderly passengers with horrific waits at immigration and ditto Atlanta. I decided some years ago to use JFK for arrival normally in Terminals 4 or 5 and then to exit normally with an Asian 5 star airline. Never again! The arrivals by JetBlue are disastrous now with gates not available and immigration waits of more than 2 hours. At Terminal 7 all but American passengers waited for 150 minutes plus to be processed from an ANA flight from Tokyo But now even the departures are disasters with waits of more than 2 hours on the tarmac quite regular and in my case in June more than 5 hours. Why are the USA airports so bad for non Americans and why are the elderly treated so badly? It is quite ridiculous but with all the delays in the USA, I will be flying in the future via Madrid, Paris or London to get to Asia, it will be quicker and have less stress.",-1

At the security point, after passing the scanner, I was asked to go on the side where I was asked to empty my pockets. I had an empty plastic SIM card holder and a few paper tissues still in my pockets, as I didn’t know we have to fully empty our pockets. I assumed we just need to get rid of the metal. The officer asked ""You didn't know you have to get everything out of your pockets?"" to which I replied ""No"". He then told me I have to be thoroughly checked and explained that meant feeling up my legs thoroughly. After providing a brief explanation, this is what the officer did, in presence of his supervisor. Also, the officer examined my hand palms with what I presume is a drug detector. In that moment I was too intimidated to ask why all this was necessary as the officer was loud and, also, I was afraid of a potential delay with proceeding to my gate. So, I simply agreed and asked nothing. It is not clear to me why such a thorough check-up was necessary. Why I wasn’t simply allowed to go back through the scanner after taking out the SIM card plastic holder and my tissues is beyond me.",-1

I flew out of Terminal 4 on Delta and returned through Terminal 1 (having flown in on Alitalia). Absolutely no problems either way. I was able to print out my departure boarding pass from a machine and did not even have to go to the airline counter. I received a TSA pre-check on my departure and that made the security walk through a breeze. Terminal 4 has lots of shops and quite a few restaurants. They provide a full range of choices in products, services, and prices. The Delta flight departure was very well organized with agents ensuring boarding groups were kept separated. Announcements were made in a timely manner and the plane pushed back on time. The terminal was busy but clean and it had all the excitement of planes departing to all corners of the globe. Signs were ample and self-explanatory. I had the fastest exit in my life after arriving in Terminal 1. At 4 pm, the arriving area had no passengers from other flights. I used the machine to have my passport read and presented the slip to the agent at the exit gate along with the passport. He waved me through. There were many such machines. Having no checked luggage, I briskly walked out and made my way across the terminal to the Sky Train which for 5 US dollars connected me to the main train system of New York City. Signs were ample and self-explanatory. Another fully satisfactory experience with JFK.",1

Arrival from PDL: Global entry kiosks wouldn't work, so I took passport (but not the little slip on fax-like paper) to agent, who yelled at me ""to go back there, into the second door on the right."" I thought I was obeying - until he yelled ""No, you stupid idiot! You can't go in there! I said the second door on the right!""

2018-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,4.5 hours to get through immigration,False," For a city that professes to be the ""best in the world"" I can only say that my experience at JFK was an omen of what was to come. I hated the cynical, money grabbing nature of the city but the airport was just beyond awful. Arrived at 16:30 expecting to be in and out of immigration in an hour. Immigration hall was packed to the rafters with people off previous flights. No desks were open and there was just one staff member wandering about looking bored and not acknowledging anyone. A sign above stated waiting time was 90 minutes, which bearing in mind the amount of people waiting to go through was a bit of a stretch I thought. 2 hours later, one desk opens and we were shuttled like sheep through a maze of queues. Kids were crying, people were sat on the floor, an old couple constantly appealed to the one security guard as to why more gates were not open, only to be stared at with no response. Rude beyond belief. The heat was awful, there must have been 600 or more people queuing. After 3 hours one more gate was open so the queue started to flow a little quicker, but again, by now people were becoming fractious. Another two plane loads arrive making the heat unbearable and space at a minimum. There were no chairs to sit or places to buy water. Eventually at 9 oclock, 4.5 hours later we got through the immigration queue. I cannot describe what an ordeal it was. The staff were rude, unresponsive, gave no explanation or apology for the interminable wait, and cared not for the distress suffered by the young and old. We arrived at our hotel at 11 at night. A whole evening wasted in that damned hell hole. I have spoken with others who confirmed that this is about normal for JFK. So if you can find another means of getting into the city, do so, try another airport, because this was positively third rate treatment. Disgusted!",-1

For as long as I can remember, there have been ‘improvements’ going on at terminal 7 but nothing improves. The seating is insufficient, the layout inefficient and the (few) food outlets terrible. No one would chose to fly from here if they did not have to. In the main restaurant, I ordered a salad which never arrived so I had to leave without eating as the flight departure time was approaching. I bought a sandwich in the shop - it must have been in the fridge for 12 hours - it was inedible. British Airways has its own problems more generally but having to depart from here does not help its corporate image.

Their procedures were unnecessarily slow. I had shaving cream in excess of allowance I guess, (no problems with same baggage in two checkpoints in Europe). It took them more than 15 min to check the bags, and confiscate the item. The TSA staff kept on talking, to her co-workers, I am hard of hearing.

Dirty airport, toilets disgusting, Alitalia lounge agent didn’t say a word to us as we presented our passes completely blanked us. Lounge dirty, overcrowded, stale food and a horrible experience.

Many TSA and border agents are rude and untactful, and if they're not, it's just plain disorganization, but on my last trip, the immigration staff managed to be rude and insulting both flying out and back (in transit). The first time, my wife, who has two passports, was unsure as to which passport to use. I won't go into details, but it was in complete good faith, but still an immigration officer told her arrogantly that she was ""playing with identities"" and to me, when I tried to explain the reasons, he asked aggressively how much I knew about migration law. Then, on the way back, another officer, having learned that we live in the DR, absentmindedly said ""and I thought this was a bad place"", right out of thin air. My other encounters with this airport have been better, but not exactly great.",-1
2018-04-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,truly dreadful airport,False,"  I live in the New York area and therefore have to frequent this truly dreadful airport. There is no terminal at JFK without its flaws. Departures at Terminal One is somewhat decent, but the arrivals there is by far the worst. Terminal Four is a disgusting mess, and the rest are all horrible as well. To start, the staff at JFK are some of the rudest people I have ever met in my life. Just walking through the terminal you get looks from them, when you ask for help they're condescending, they bark orders at you instead of using a basic human being's tone. The airport is also disgusting. The bathrooms are not clean, some of the seats in the terminal or at gates will be wet or sticky, it's truly disgusting. The airport is also very confusing, gates are not clearly marked, nor where to find them. There are very few boards throughout the terminal. All staff at restaurants or food concessions are rude, or mess up your order, or are clueless. Flights at JFK are frequently delayed, and planes take forever to get to the gate which I can't seem to find a reason as to why that would be the airline's fault. The wifi at the airport also doesn't work at all, and better yet they don't seem to get any kind of cell service there (I've jumped around carriers and have always had the same issue). The security at the airport is a whole other animal. These people assume every person in line is guilty and will not hesitate to yell at you. The people at customs as well love to harass. The lounges at JFK also seem to be lacking. All New York area airports are lacking, but JFK really seems to be the worst.",-1

Lady shouting orders at us then tutting at us as if we were idiots as I handed her all passports together. She kissed her lips saying, 'jeez you should know it’s one at a time' then proceeded to shout at us to move quicker down the line. Rudest person I have ever met, JFK. You need to do some customer service with your rude staff, I won’t be travelling to or from this airport ever again.",-1
2018-04-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,lots of seating and bathrooms,True," As a frequent user of this airport, I am surprised by the generally negative reviews it gets. I mostly use Terminal 8 - tenants include American Airlines and several One World members - and have found it to be modern, spacious, with lots of seating and bathrooms, along with shops and eateries, and clean and tidy too! My recent trip through terminal 8 was no exception. True, the TSA staff often do not exude charm but they keep the lines moving through the security machines. On departure, I used the Admirals lounge - it offers nice views of the taxiways through large windows and a good selection of hard and soft drinks. More attention needs to be given to keep the food areas tidy, but more importantly, ensure the food trays have food on them! I returned from Canada and with US immigration done at point of departure, arrival at and exit out of the airport could not be faster or easier. Reviews on this site suggest that the experience varies across terminals and thus broad generalization about JFK may overlook many positive aspects of the airport including its easy access by public transportation.",1
2018-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,signage was wrong or non-existent,True," After a 15 hour flight from Doha (and with connections to CA) I was stunned by the disorganization, wait-time and general chaos while re-entering the US today (March 31, 2018). The signage was wrong or non-existent, US Citizens are thrown into the same “lines” as non-citizens and there are far too few Officials to establish a semblance of order. The “Passport & Immigrantion” touch screens are temperamental and require multiple attempts to advance in order to procure the coveted ‘receipt’. One beleaguered red-coated employee said this was the ‘new normal’ as staffing was insufficient. That is clearly part of the problem, but the whole ‘process’ is highly problematic. We waited well over an hour to pass through and nearly missed our connection — with many others waiting much longer. And as we all stood there like cattle, it was impossible to get WiFi. One helpful fellow recommended downloading the Mobile Passport App in the future - but this doesn’t help visitors who were as distressed and annoyed as those of us who are citizens.",-1
2018-03-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,subjected to incompetence,True," After an 11 hour flight we were subjected to incompetence, rudeness and automated equipment failure, both in the passport scanning equipment and the fingerprint scanning equipment during our entry to the USA interview. There is no distinction between US Citizens and foreigners who all are forced to stand and wait in the same lines. The red jacketed attendant stupidly replied to me that this was a better system, that the signs for USCitizens did not mean anything, and that no one was superior with this system. This insulted me for several reasons. 1) All foreign destinations have lines for citizens and another line for non-citizens. The citizens lines tend to move rapidly. 2) I am a Vietnam Vet, a US Citizen, a taxpayer and feel we should have priority entering our own country. As it was, we waited in line for 2 hours, and after the fingerprint scanner failed, the Officer simply got up from his desk, closed the door and walked off the floor. If this was a private business, he would have been fired.",-1
2018-03-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TSA rude and unhelpful,False," TSA rude and unhelpful. Barking orders as loudly as possible and all the time the same orders as though it was a meat processing plant. We were told we were TSA Approved and it was on our pass for boarding - we were told to tell the staff member which we did. It seemed to make them want to search for a problem even more. They ridiculed my plastic boots given to all passengers in Madrid to keep their feet or socks clean when they remove shoes, and they were so rude and told me it was not acceptable after I had cleared the machine - shoes removed because of big heals. There was zero in my tiny case other than clothes but they held it back and kept it for so long another passenger intervened and told them to give it to me, and they had just left it sitting behind the the x ray box and had not done anything with it after the screening there! They then proceeded to try to close it and were catching the clothes in the zipper which seemed to amuse the man doing it. We asked for it back to close ourselves, before something was torn. This is about the third trip through this airport and we will never return to the airports [or city]. The flight to Seattle from Virgin was delayed three times and the the third time it was then backtracked upon and we were told - by a soft human voice and no inter-com it was ""going right now"". By then many people had walked right away from the gate to fill the three hours projected wait from the last delay: somewhere other than the boring gate area. People crowded around frantic to get on, and there was only an elderly staff member half directing who was boarding in a quiet voice with no inter-com. It was a total gong show, unbelievable. No cabin staff around other than at the door, and suitcases being stuffed into bins overhead where half would literally not fit! Swap out most of the staff to Seatac for two weeks and show them some manners and common sense tactics. Maybe La Guardia is better?? NJ certainly is not! I am a well travelled 72 year old, and this airport is the worst of the worst. Pay staff properly and get some fresh faces, not control freaks!",-1

The staff in security and even in restaurants were either unhelpful, rude, uninterested, or spoke to people very poorly, as if we are to blame for how unorganized they are? I have read numerous other negative reviews now and would not return to this airport by choice ever again. I hope someone higher up decides to take more pride in this establishment because it’s embarassing how awful our and others’ experiences have been. I would never recommend this airport to anyone.",-1

",False,  JFK is the worst airport to have to get your bags at. Whenever I travel in Europe or another state you get off the plane and your bags arrive shortly after.

You guys need to learn a few manners, try fellow Americans at Walt Disney world, they'd teach you a thing or two. Security staff were by far the worst here, very unprofessional, rude and unhelpful. Good luck to whoever is in charge of this disorganised team, you're definitely going to need it.

Once I got into the customs hall reality hit - 1.5 hours waiting in line with hundreds maybe even thousands of other passengers to get processed. Heres the thing - they have 60 desks - 3 of which were manned. The whole feeling there was one of absoloute disdain for the passengers experience. Avoid this airport - find another route unless you like standing bored senseless as a first taste of America.,-1
2018-03-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,such poor treatment,True,"  I won't be going near this airport ever again, I have never ever experienced such poor treatment,  rudeness, laziness and gruesome attitude of staff that obviously think they are superior to all of us passengers. I hardly managed to catch my flight because of long queues, and because instead of following the signs and going into separate lines, all of us had to go in one line. Machines are not working properly, there is no one to show you what to do, and when you finally fight your way through crazed passengers and arrive to the officer in charge who will check your passport, you get a terrible treatment. Unfortunately, no one will care about all these negative reviews and about all our frustrations, until we all stop flying to and via NYC. Considering the number of people in the world, this will never happen, but I sincerely hope that someone will make a big deal out of it, someone important who will be treated like this and put a stop to all incompetent and miserable people who work there. Such an amazing city, but when you arrive it makes you never want to visit it again. Not even in transit.",-1
2018-03-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,treated terribly on arrival,True," Horrific experience. I am not sure why, but the staff here think they are far superior to any passenger! We were treated terribly on arrival to the airport, with staff either ignoring us when we asked questions about which ESTA lane to join or they simply shouted their robotic “all first time ESTAs this way” in our faces. Both of us had been to the USA previously, so we joined the “returning ESTA” line, but apparently if you haven’t been within the last 2 years you have to join the “first time ESTA” line? Had the rude staff member we approached explained this it would have been quite simple. Then on departure the man at security was simply inhuman. Screeming at people to step inside a security screen and then barking orders like “don’t you dare move a muscle”, “are you blind?”. I understand the need for strict security with all that has happened in recent years, and I can appreciate the need for staff to be formal and professional, but that is not what this was. There was a complete disregard for maintaining the respect and dignity of passengers. There is absolutely no need to speak to people in such a manner, these people need to be taught some manners and get off their high horses. I won’t be flying into America again for this reason. I’d rather explore all of the other wonderful places in the world that treat other people with dignity and respect. The cleanliness of the airport was also an issue. With smelly toilets that were consistently out of loo paper and sticky seats and tables.",-1

Each visit the process of going through immigration and security gets worse. On arrival from Heathrow it was clear to some of the staff at JFK that a few of us weren't sure where we had to go. When we approached staff we were either ignored, tutted at or laughed at. One member of staff was sniggering at a family struggling to use the self check in machines. It was chaotic. However at the end of our trip when we returned to JFK well what can I say. TSA service was disgusting. The only thing missing was a cattle prod. Shouting orders, humiliating people, talking to us like we were animals. I have never in my life experienced another human being talking to any member of the public like this. There was no need for it. Many people were visibly upset and uncomfortable. It upset myself and my daughter. I will never ever return to America again. It has totally put me off forever. I would also recommend friends and family to avoid JFK at all costs. That is unless they want to be treated like a prisoner. It was so nice to get home to Britain.",-1

This is the first tsa checkpoint I have encountered with the most rude and unprofessional personnel in my thirty years of traveling around the world. The superiors of the tsa personnel need to go under cover and see for themselves what a nightmare JFK airport really is. The tsa employees were inconsiderate, rude, and words cannot describe their unprofessionalism. Not only was my family affected by their actions, but everyone in the same line. Never ever go to this airport, until they clean up the tsa's act! Other than the tsa, everything was fine.",-1

The booking allowed for 3.5 hours between flights which we assumed would be sufficient. In fairness to the airport there had been heavy snow the day before but when we arrived and went to baggage reclaim, it took 2 hours for the bags to come through, my bag came through on a different carousel! It was sheer luck I overheard another passenger telling someone that I found my bag at all. We deposited them with the Baggage Transfer Desk and ran to catch our flight which was, fortunately for us, delayed anyway. The staff there were surly, unhelpful and rude, no appreciation of our dilemma at all. We arrived at Cancun to find out our baggage had not arrived and in fact it took 3 days to turn up, we were very stressed and ended up having to go shopping for clothes and other items which we could barely fit in our luggage. On our return, everything ran very smoothly, arrived in time, quickly retrieved our luggage, passed it to Baggage Transfer and got on our flight without any problems back to Heathrow. Unbelievably only one of our bags turned up, we are still waiting for the other one which was delayed for reasons unknown in JFK. I will never ever go via this airport again, I will either find another route or not bother than go through this misery. If it wasn't for my boyfriend's and I determination to make the best of a bad situation, it would have totally destroyed out first long distance holiday together. Avoid this airport at all costs.",-1

I arrived from Cairo and left a 3.5 hour transit time. The immigration queues are massive and once you pass immigration you have go to baggage claim. You need to buy a trolley for $6, god help you if you manage to find one, let alone if you don't have dollars. Unfortunately the airport staff are not helpful and aggressive and make you feel you are not to approach or bother them. In transit you need to claim baggage first if you arrival in terminal 4, its chaotic getting out and trying to find your terminal departure or connecting flight - very crowded. I would honestly try to plan to avoid arriving in JFK. The departure hall in terminal 4 is really nice with a lot of amenities and services, if you have the luxury of time, however even with a 3.5 hour transit time I thought that was enough, I was wrong.",-1

It was a horrible experience! First we kept getting delayed because of the plane leaving JFK to get to us. 5 hour delay which cost us an extra $150 in lunch and drinks at the airport for four of us. We finally board, and land at JFK only to be told we don't have a gate! Sat there for almost 3 hours, pull up to a gate and no one to direct the pilot all the way in. 15 min wait for that! So glad that we didn't have bags checked in! I'm now sick because of being up for 24 hours. My youngest son had to drive back to college that same day. Should have been home by 9.30 Saturday night instead of 5.30 am Sunday. Felt bad for the flight crew, they were completely spent from being on the previous flight also.

Every member of staff I came into contact with was disinterested in their tasks, rude, careless and irritated. At customs I was shouted at by members of staff and when making a mistake with which way to line up I was humiliated by staff who laughed at me and questioned me in the most patronising way about why I had gone one way and not another. Once through customs I burst into tears after such an unnecessary and upsetting ordeal. The staff at JFK are absolutely the rudest people I have ever met. I cannot understand why they are allowed to behave like that. I will avoid this airport at all costs in future and will be reluctant to visit NYC. Disgraceful.

They were very obviously never taught any manners or customer service skills and they must have no one supervising them.The way they spoke at (yes spoke at, not to) people queuing up made my blood boil and I could see a number of people extremely annoyed by their behaviour.

What can you say. I didn't know why it didn't work. He tried again, still nothing. So then he starts shouting at me to go to a different scanner. It appeared it was all my fault that it didn't work. The second scanner was successful on the second attempt. It was all done in a horrible uncaring manner and I have to say I was beginning to regret traveling to New York at all. The immigration official was so miserable and rude I felt I was totally not welcome in the country. When leaving New York it was even worse. I was in a wheelchair again and was shouted at to go this way and that way. I then underwent an intensive search in public. The wheelchair was scanned and that belonged to the airport. When he was finished I was told that I was sitting in the wheelchair with my legs apart and that looked suspicious. I suppose that and the fact that my body was shaking because I have Parkinson's made me a potential criminal at 73 years old.

A complete lack of seating is available which is not helpful at all when travelling with elderly relatives. There were no customer assistants or staff to direct or help. The air con was broken or does not exist but the temperature was far too hot and unacceptable. The wandering tiki was over run with people due to lack of seating in the terminal or at the gates. Just trying to get a drink was an ordeal in itself. The staff however were friendly but evidently unable to keep up with demand.

The place is filthy and the food selections are downright terrible. When I checked my luggage in, the clerk was extremely rude straight away and acted bothered by nothing. TSA both coming and going were unprofessional with horrible attitudes whose only real profession seemed to be making snide comments for extremely petty reasons. Everywhere I went there were long lines of people being herded along like cattle by some rude staff member. I have to wonder, is it in these people's job descriptions to be blatantly rude?

2017-09-15,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,New York JFK Airport customer review,False,"  TSA staff at Terminal 7 were extremely rude, perhaps the worst I've ever encountered. They literally bark at you, offering no assistance if you look like you're struggling. My husband forgot his wedding ring after leaving security, when he went back to get it the TSA officer was disgustingly rude. My husband is not one to back down so he gave him a piece of his mind. Nevertheless, it was a horrible experience. You can be firm and polite, there is absolutely no excuse for such rudeness.",-1
2017-09-13,0.8,Family Leisure,2.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,3.0,an extremely long walk to US Customs,False,"  When I arrived in New York's JFK Airport, it was an extremely long walk to US Customs. Once I arrived at customs there were two very long lines. Since I was a US citizen, I was able to get on the shorter line. I had to use electronic kiosks and then was redirected to a long line. But luckily, there were plenty Customs Officers on duty so I was able to get through in about 20 minutes. Baggage claim wasn't too bad and taxi dispatch got me a taxi really quickly.",1

Very inefficient system of scattered scanners, people having difficulty and staff refusing to help people. Then you wait in a disorganized line for customs control. Asked me if I brought anything and I replied that I didn't bring food whereby he rudely lashed out ""that's not what I asked you"". This is no way to be welcomed back to the United States regardless of being citizen or not. We are supposed to be a leader in technology and friendly country yet first impressions by every face I saw was one of misery, fear of complaining and disappointment. Luggage area has videos playing yet no info on which flight suitcases are coming from. Very disappointing.",-1
2017-08-24,0.6,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,3.0,I must have entered another dimension,False,"  I arrived at JFK for the first time in four years in June 2017. The immigration checkpoint had changed by then, with everyone required to scan his/her passport at a computer kiosk. Fortunately, an airport employee was nice enough to show me where to stand to take my picture. The Homeland Security official who checked my passport and customs declaration form (6059B) didn't stamp it. After retrieving my luggage and queuing up to submit the 6059B, an armed customs officer brusquely asked me why I'd gotten in line. I told him that I was waiting to submit the form and he rhetorically asked if he'd told me to get in line. So I left the queue and exited the terminal. Thankfully, that was the only bad treatment I got at JFK during this trip. Two months later, when I departed New York, security at its Terminal 1 was surprisingly streamlined. TSA didn't require passengers to take off their shoes, produce their laptops, or receive a body scan/patdown. I must have entered another dimension.",1
2017-08-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,TSA agents were beyond rude,False,"  I used to like Terminal One at JFK. No so, this time. The TSA agents were beyond rude. They were shouting (barking) orders at the people on the line as if they were drill sergeants. If someone left something in his or her pocket they insulted him and yelled that he's holding up the line. When someone is screaming at you at the top of his lungs, it's hard to comprehend and follow his instructions. I have been to airports all over the world and do occasionally make a mistake. I have found that everywhere else, the agents are polite and usually friendly. These people need serious retraining and should be let go if they can't behave like humans.",-1
2017-08-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,I was in a good mood before I got to this place,False,"  Rudest staff I have ever encountered at an airport or any place of business for that matter. I don't fly often so I was not familiar with the kiosk check in. It asked for my confirmation number, I did not know where to find it on my voucher (it was called something different on the voucher) so I asked a floor staff member for help. I asked how to use the kiosk and she replied, ""what's hard about it? Do you know how to read? All you have to do is read!"" Her tone was demeaning and she kept walking as she was speaking to me. TSA agents were basically rude robots getting easily frustrated over nothing. Even the lady working at the small convenience store near gate #32 was extremely rude when a price was not clear on an item. I was in a good mood before I got to this place.",-1

My flight was delayed 3 hours, and not once was anyone in the slightest bit apologetic, and when I asked how much longer it would be and politely mentioned I had been traveling for 22 hours and was deeply tired they said to me 'oh well that's not our fault is it'.

2017-06-20,0.7,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,good collection of shops and restaurants,False,"  I used Terminal 1 for our recent trip. On the outbound journey, the security check lines were long but moved rapidly. The terminal is used by a large number of airlines. It has a good collection of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia lounge was spacious and airy with a good selection of self servings of finger food and drinks including beer from Italy. It also offered free wifi and an announcement was made when our flight was ready to board. On return, we used the automatic kiosks for our passports. The exit was a breeze. The officers were pleasant and we were out of the terminal in no time. In sum, it was a hitch free experience considering the number of passengers and flights that as handled by this terminal.",1
2017-06-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,the rudest agents I have ever encountered,False,"  The TSA agents at JFK are the rudest agents I have ever encountered. Several of them were shamelessly shouting at passengers undergoing security screening. Others simply didn't deign to speak to passengers. My partner was retrieving his things after they had been scanned, and he was apparently in one officer's way. Instead of saying ""excuse me"" like a decent person, she stood directly behind him until he noticed her, and then she made the ""shoo"" hand gesture at him. From one adult to another! It's honestly appalling. Additionally, Terminal 7 doesn't have enough seating, and I have located exactly six outlets (that work - I found two others that did not work) in the Gates 1-6 section. And I don't mean six pairs, I mean three pairs.",-1

Incredibly slow immigration process once again. It rivals the arrivals process at MIA. Passengers with connecting flights should be warned to allow at least three hours between flights, not the two hours or even less posted by the airlines. An incredibly stressful process.",1

Less than 50 feet later, we were told we couldn't take the cart in. That is absolutely wrong! There was no sign saying that you couldn't take it. The airport was so hot, the hike to the gate was ridiculously long without the cart. After an overseas flight, it is ridiculous to not provide some kind of cart to go to the gate.",-1
2017-04-15,0.2,Family Leisure,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,shocking customer service,False,"  Shocking customer service. The terminal transfer train comes every 15 to 20 minutes! I sat and watched as the cleaner moved 3 customers who were in the middle of their meals so he could rearrange the tables. I then tried to get a coffee in the only coffee shop open in the entire terminal (it's 9.47 pm) only to be told they wouldn't serve me because they are closing, in 15 minutes. So far, that attitude of every staff member has been that they simply couldn't care less. The management needs some serious addressing to have allowed the staff to get away with such poor performance.",-1

We joined the conga line in about 300th place and the queue did not move for ages. Looking around I could see 2 officers in booths. This is ridiculous, by now the line had extended to crazy proportions and there must have been 1500 people some with very young children crying through tiredness and hunger. We were given no reason for this delay and were not given any water at all. It took us nearly 4hrs from plane to leaving. I think this needs looking at very seriously. I suffer from diabetes and this made me feel dreadful through lack of food and water and ruined my first day in a wonderful country.",-1
2017-03-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,1.0,,no explanation or apology was made,False,"  I have used this airport many times, where I have generally not had a bad experience. But after my recent trip to New York, passing through JFK, I am left feeling saddened by my observation that something has gone very wrong with this airports ability to provide a decent level of customer service. My arrival process involved myself and other customers being left standing in a line, not moving, for a considerable length of time, looking at empty immigration desks. Also the self service pass port check machines were not available. No explanation or apology was made for a very obvious problem. Some public announcement was made, worded in a way that only airport staff could understand, immigration officers made their way to their desks, we were then processed reasonably quickly. It was during my departure when I experienced similar issues already explained in other bad reviews for this airport, regarding security staff. I am left disgusted by the total lack of professionalism and any kind of courtesy or respect from your staff during the security process. I shared my concern with a member of staff at the Information Desk (with the understanding that it was not within her jurisdiction) who's response made it clear to me that she felt I was overreacting. I am left feeling that the management of JFK Airport have no understanding or just don't care that their airport staff are giving their customers such a vile experience. I don't feel comfortable to give JFK Airport my custom again.",-1

I am a seasoned traveler arrived at terminal 2 to go to terminal 4. No signs, no info, no help for luggage. I had to go outside, cross the road find the air train to get to terminal 4. Then the tea agent toget into security area to renovate was rude and when I asked a question was even more rude. I have never had this treatment anywhere but JFK. The lines for security are very long, I couldn't find the end of the line because they appear to be clumped together. Needless to say avoid at all costs. This place is an embarrassment",-1

I arrive shortly before 6am and see a long security line so I realize I am unlikely to make my flight. It's my fault so I realize I have to accept my fate. But once they scanned my ticket, a TSA worker asks who is boarding the flight. I raise my hand and they make sure I get through the security line and tell me to run towards the gate. I run to the gate with my bag and the airline staff usher me on board, as I'm the last to arrive before the doors close. I am so thankful I made my flight! JFK gets some poor reviews and I've had less than stellar experiences there but this one restores my faith in JFK staff. They have to put up with a lot and I really appreciated them helping me make my flight.",1

2017-01-15,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,immigration is a shambles,False," New York JFK is probably the worst airport I have ever been to and I have been to many. Staff are horrible. There is no real method to lining up to go through security it just seems like a mess. They keep telling you not to block the areas but there is nowhere for people to go. Immigration is a shambles, the machines are good but again there is no real methodology to lining up. It says go to a machine when the lights are green but there are about 100 machines, half of which you can't see from the line. I was at gate C68 and assumed I had plenty of time when I followed the signs but no, without warning it told me I had to take a shuttle bus to another terminal. Why not say that like other airports e.g. time from here to gate -- then people know where they are and how much time they have - simple. Luckily though I did have enough time due to the airports sheer incompetence. As I write this I am still sitting on the plane after 2.5 hours waiting to be de-iced. I mean who would ever think that it snows in New York in January? If only we could forecast these things and maybe get more than one hairdryer to de-ice 125 planes! I am just passing through from a civilized airport, Heathrow, I am going to avoid this airport in future even if it costs more.",-1

We arrived at terminal 4 on 24th September. Having been through the British Airways terminal a number of years ago you are not prepared for your treatment at terminal 4. We are currently appealing a no show on our taxi company as we were held for two and a half hours through security. My only regret is that I did not ask for the person's ID and name as he was enjoying every minute of the delay he was causing. Can I suggest you get rid of all the people controlling the queues saving that expense in favour of a light and bell system where you are called individually by the desk operator then you don't get the situation we all had which was being directed by a staff member at the head of the main queue to desks where there were already queues and being stuck. Our operator then delighted in closing two desks either side where people were queuing and asking us to merge into one. He then got a query and went off to seek advice delaying it even further. Whilst I think we all appreciate the vigilance we also travelled recently through Paris CDG and London Heathrow both experiencing the same security issues as the US but without the grief experienced in your country. Further to my suggestion of a bell and lighting system perhaps the government could seek advice from every major bank or retailer who operates these systems very efficiently.

The treatment from most of the airport staff was quite degrading. In a previous comment somebody mentioned that, when going through security check, a woman was yelling 'they aint gonna load emselves' to the people so that they put their bags/items onto the conveyor. That is exactly what I heard too. I mean, what are we? Animals? Passport control was even worse. There was a woman there, looking completely unprofessional, that was yelling incoherently to the people to go where she was pointing at. At first, when I was still a bit farther away, I thought it was some crazy person and the security would pick her up, but it was indeed airport staff. Finally, I would imagine that the main airport for one of the biggest cities in the world would be spacious, but far from it; narrow corridors and a general claustrophobic environment.",-1

It took over an hour just to reach the ESTA machines. Due to poor signage, we asked what we should do with our little printouts from the machines and were directed along a corridor. Seconds later we were bellowed at by someone asking us to get back in the line. We explained that we'd been sent through but to no avail. We then collected our baggage and then we queued up to leave the airport and give another rude and sullen employee our stamped ticket. Altogether we had waited almost 2 hours. The taxi queue outside was unbelievable. Not due to lack of taxis but to the traffic chaos outside. Everyone for arrivals and departures are at the same place. Cars, buses, taxis with lanes constantly blocked by people stopping wherever they felt like it to unload / load etc. An employee ran up and down, yelling and blowing a whistle to keep the traffic moving. Nowhere is adequately signed e.g. Stand A, B etc. There is just one sign - Passenger Pick up and Drop off. I assume this means along the whole length of the airport. Hence no-one knows where exactly to wait. Everyone asked everyone else what to do. It was absolute chaos. In the queue for the taxi passengers further down were always trying to cut in but after an hour and a half wait, I couldn't blame them. From leaving the plane to getting a taxi took 3.5 hours. Overall the airport is poorly signed, with most monitors showing advertising instead of information. It is a challenge to find the toilets. Seating is limited and the whole atmosphere is stressful and unwelcoming. As for the airport staff - loud and rude is all that I can say. Never again, not even with a connecting flight.",-1

JFK is the worst airport I have ever used, and I've used many. It is almost impossible to make a 3 hour layover as the lines to immigration go forever. You get out of the plane and the line starts already at gate entrance. There is no information what this line was for or what is going on. The only spoken announcements were initially in Spanish. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Took 2 hours to clear immigration, then 30 minutes to check in for the next flight. You need to claim your luggage before transfer. Made it only because my next flight was first delayed, then cancelled - something that happens frequently at JFK. My advice - if you can, use a different airport for your arrival into the US.",-1

Considering it is an old airport and among the busiest ones in the world JFK is a good, convenient to use airport. When we landed there it was easy to get through passports (friendly staff) and suitcases arrived quickly. Taxis and transport to the city are easy to find. Departing was also easy with small ques and fast but efficient security control. Not the biggest variety of shops but good enough to spend some time. All in all a good experience.",1
2016-08-03,0.7,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,not built for the A380,False,"  I flew with a group of my students to New York on a field trip. The last day, the pilots of Lufthansa went on strike. We got to JFK very early to make sure that we were rebooked on a different flight. The airline put us together on the SIA flight to Frankfurt. We had to change terminals going from 1 to 4 with all of our luggage and 5 teenagers who just lost their final day in NYC. After standing in line for more than 1.5 hours, we had to stand in line again for more than 2 hours. By the time we had checked-in, there was no going back to Manhattan. We passed security and hoped for the best. The typical food stands, Starbucks and Shake-a-Shack available. Most of the time they were bored to tears - so my advice, if you travel with boys between 15 and 18 do not get to JFK 4 hours prior departure. JFK has not been built for the A380 and the number of passengers. It is difficult to find available seating at their departure gates and this has happened to me with both LH and SIA.",1
