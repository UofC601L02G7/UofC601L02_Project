However, our luggage was lost/delayed during our 11.25 hour overnight layover in Seattle. The Seattle-Tacoma Airport had issues with their sorting systems, but with so much time between flights and it being an overnight layover, the lost/delayed luggage seems rather unacceptable. Compensation was not offered upon arrival at our final destination until I asked about it. The airline sent an email telling us about the issues at the Seattle airport, 6 hours after we had already checked our bags and were enroute to Seattle. Extremely disappointed in the handling of our belongings which included gifts purchased while on vacation and medications.",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 737 max', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Cancun to Edmonton via Seattle', 'Date Flown': 'August 2024', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 4, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We were set to fly out at 9am and we got notified around 4am our flight was canceled, not delayed, fully canceled. We immediately called customer support and it was a 4 hour wait. We got a call back around 11am and they said there are no other flights going out and they were not sure when another one would go out to Seattle. We tried later in the evening to check if any flights were available and there were a few but all $500+ per ticket (triple what we paid) and had a full day layover. We would waste half our trip trying to just catch a flight out. We had no other option but to cancel the entire trip and try to get refunds. Within their contract they are responsible to put us on the next outgoing flight and they failed to do so. Support was not any help and often rude about the situation.

Tried to take a weekend vacation and it was absolutely destroyed by this company. They put the wrong gate and destination name was reversed to what was on the board. I was sent to the other side of the airport to a gate they didn’t use that took a half hour dragging luggage, then running back with it after it was determined that they printed the wrong gate on the ticket. Name on the ticket for the destination was San Lucas Cabo while on the board was Los Cabo as you can imagine not under C nor S. Missed the flight and their customer service rep couldn’t help herself but to continue raising her voice although I reminded numerous times to lower it and keep it leveled with mine, after all she wasn’t the one that missed her flight and had to run around the airport. Charged me to rebook the flight the next day, wouldn’t cover or compensate hotel nor car rides for being stuck in a different city. Then found out that they had misspelled my name on the rebooked ticket that took over an hour on the phone to fix. But the fun didn’t stop there, while I had paid for premium that included checking bags, they didn’t have the same level the next day but while not willing to refund the difference even, charged a me for checking in the bag. Still not done with their shenanigans, the next day, after we waited in line to go through security, once we made it there, the flight they had assigned to my wife’s passport was different than the one showing on the app so couldn’t go through, had to get out of the line and go wait on the checking bag line to get it fixed then go back to the security line to go through. Proof of the ticket and events were provided to their customer service and a week after supposed review, they admitted the fault and their offer was $250 credit towards the next flight with them, my tickets were over $2,000 for both of us.

2024-05-25,1,10,"""no refund of anything""",M Hayle,"✅ Trip Verified |  I put a sign on one of my carry-on bags, warning about a (fictitious) anti-theft device with an alarm inside of it, just to discourage bag-snatchers. TSA didn’t have any problem with the sign being on my bag, nor with what it said. Airport security at both BLI and SEATAC didn’t have any problem with it. No one at all on the first flight from Bellingham to Seattle (also Alaska Airlines) had any problem with it. And no one at the boarding gate in SEATAC had any problem with it. Then, when I got on the plane, as I was getting to my seat (at the back of the plane), a flight attendant asked me about it. I told them, then took the sign off of my bag and put it away - just in case - stored said bag in the overhead compartment, and took my seat. Two other attendants then came and asked me about the now removed sign, one at a time, and I repeated my explanation to each of them. A fourth attendant then came, and asked me to bring my bags “up front to discuss them” . This was a lie, as, when I reached the front, they walked me off of the plane, and told me that several passengers were “uncomfortable” with the sign. They then re-booked me, without my input, to a much later flight, which would cause me to miss the wedding I was supposed to give the toast at. After talking with Guest Services, I decided to head back home to Bellingham so that I could at least give the toast over FaceTime. However, doing so required the approval of two different supervisors in Guest Services at SEATAC to make happen, because the Customer Service rep (in Phoenix) said that they could neither change anything about the bookings nor refund anyof the round-trip ticket because of the first re-booking - despite the fact that said re-booking was done without my input. Regarding the two supervisors, the first confirmed that no noise-making capable devices are allowed on the plane, and the second said that signs such as mine that “might make some people uncomfortable” are not allowed either. Not that you’ll find either of those statements on the airline’s website, of course - I checked. And given that nobody on the first flight even mentioned it to me, I have my doubts about whether or not this was “official” Alaska Airlines policy. Long story short, don’t fly Alaska. They (apparently) reserve the right to selectively impose new rules based solely on people’s feelings, even if it disenfranchises their paying customers - and some of them will even lie to do so. Just to be clear, at NO point did anyone say anything about any Federal or State laws, nor was security ever involved, so I’m pretty sure what happened was all on Alaska. Including the fact that I’m getting nothing back from them - no refund of anything, nor even a voucher, not that I’d use the latter - in exchange for having my flight yanked out from under me.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Bellingham to Minneapolis via Seattle', 'Date Flown': 'May 2024', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2024-05-23,1,10,"""a very upsetting experience""",M Garlan,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I recently had a very upsetting experience with Alaska Airlines. Our Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled (no reason for the cancelation was given; it certainly was not weather-related) which caused us to miss our connecting international flight. No other flights were available that day, so we would reach our final destination 24 hours late. Consequently, we not only missed one full day of vacation, but we also incurred significant costs as we had to book a hotel room at the airport as well as another hotel room at the airport of our destination since we missed the ferry to get to our vacation rental. Not to mention that we lost out on our car and room reservations we already had and which we could now not utilize. Even though we, and especially our little son, were very sad and disappointed to miss one full day of our vacation, we stayed very patient. I am a frequent traveler and understand that these things can happen. When however, on the way back our Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled again, our patience ran thin. No other Alaska Airlines flight for the same day was available, so they had to reroute us to another airport which meant the additional expense for a long Uber ride plus a longer way home from the airport. When this flight was then delayed for more than three hours – we would now be home at three in the morning – I decided to go to the Alaska Airlines Lounge to ask for support. My son was exhausted and I wanted to see if we could sit down in the lounge for the long wait time, since it was freezing cold in the terminal. We didn’t even ask for food or beverages, just a place to sit more comfortably and warm, until our flight would leave. When the lady at the front desk of the Alaska Airlines Lounge refused any help and informed me that I would still have to pay a $30 fee per person, I was literally in tears – she showed no compassion at all! I asked if we could at least borrow a couple of blankets to get warm in the terminal, this was denied as well. Due to these two cancelled flights, we incurred additional costs close to $1,000 (for several hotel rooms, transfer costs, supplies, etc.), we lost one day of vacation on the way out and arrived home much, much later than planned. During this whole experience, Alaska Airlines did not provide any sort of support or compensation.

Planes were departing and arriving. After pulling back from the gate we sat motionless for 15 minutes or so. The pilot came on to tell us we had a shortage of fuel, and this was due to the weather and it's impact to availability of fuel. We sat for another 30-45 minutes. During this time the pilot said due to the fuel shortage we would stop in Kansas City on our way to Seattle. After about an hour on the ground in FLL he came on again to apologize for the paperwork being very slow, some corrections that needed to be made to the new flight plans. The delays caused us to be 4 hours late in arriving in Seattle. Here's the problem with Alaska - 1. They lied to us. They don't prioritize honesty with their customers. The fuel shortage scenario he tried to explain was weak at best. It was raining = not enough fuel? Alaska sent me an email apologizing for the stop in KC, but said it was unavoidable due to stronger than expected headwinds. What really happened? Lot of us lost time and $ due to this. The official determination was wind, so no reimbursements for hotels or added costs to rebook. 2. they had a service failure followed by inability to make a service recovery. They were not prepared to handle the onslaught of people who needed help.

I was informed that my flight couldn't depart due to weather issues, yet there were no apparent weather problems. It's troubling to suspect that this may be a tactic to mask the mechanical issues with their older aircraft fleet. The apparent strategy of avoiding compensation by falsely attributing delays to weather is deceptive and unacceptable. Customers deserve honesty and transparency, especially when it concerns their travel plans. I strongly advise travelers to reconsider flying with Alaska Airlines.

While I understand the crew has a specific amount of sleep assigned, that policy is not passed down to their patrons. I missed my connecting flight to Eugene Oregon because of the crew’s right to sleep, causing a 13 hour delay because there was not another flight until midnight. The parties that were to pick me up had to make the 2 hour drive from Seal Rock 2x that day. Returning, I arrived at the Eugene airport at 6:30 pm on 10/10/23 because My son and his wife had to work and could not provide transportation on 10/11/23 when my flight was scheduled. I tried to sleep but was told to move to the lobby. This caused me to go through TSA 2x. The automated announcement railed every few minutes incessantly about unattended baggage. The floor was cleaned for what felt like hours. No sleep may have been to be expected. My ticket listed Gate F, which does not exist. The telemonitor said Gate A4. Loading started at 12:59. I got concerned about 1:00 because I heard nothing. The flight was at Gate B1. I got there by 1:06 and was told that I had to reschedule. I arrived in Seattle at approximately 6, tired and unrested. I went to one of the restaurants for dinner. From 6:30-10:30 while waiting on the flight to Orlando, I ate and drank 4 glasses of wine. I still have gotten any sleep. My flight did not leave until 10:20 pm. I arrived, was allowed on, and sat down glad to have an opportunity to sleep. That would not happen. The FA said to come with her. I complied. The staff at the desk told me that I stumbled therefore I could not get on the plane. I hadn't been belligerent, aggressive, or bothered anyone. I argued with him for a moment. He had already called the police. I left the vicinity. The staff said my ticket would be refunded in 5-7 business days. I had only $130 and other tickets were running at min $400. I sat in the Seattle Airport all night because nothing was open and I did not know what to do. Staff saw me again Thurs. am, again with no sleep, and again called the cops on me, assumingly because he decided that I was not to be on the premises. I answered to the police that I had had a ticket, that I had a right to be there, and I would appreciate them not bothering me. I called Customer Service. No assistance. I went to the Alaskan CS Desk and spoke with Anthony. He was very helpful. Derrick, his Supervisor, very professional, said that he could not override the decision to allow me to fly with Alaska Airlines due to what that staff wrote in his report - I had harassed staff & become aggressive with the police, which is clearly not true if you review the camera footage I asked where I should stay and Derrick told me anywhere it did not interfere with their employment. Of which I agreed, stating that I had not done that previously. I told Derrick that he needed to tell his employee to stop calling the police on me. Due only to borrowing money from my 82 year old mother, I finally arrived at MCO airport at 10:30 am Fri am . I went to get my baggage CS They were locked. I called Alaska Airline CS again and was told that I would have to wait until 2:30 pm.

I immediately seek assistance. The baggage claim agent on 9/02, did a lot to try and help me. He tried calling the crew/gate agent or the cleaning service to see if they could look for my phone. We told me that everyone was gone because it was a late flight. Early in the morning is when the plane will be searched and cleaned for its next flight. I return on 9/03 to baggage claim to see if anything was turned in. These were of no help. They told me to file a claim (I did that the night before). They asked me to call the customer service number, I said with what phone? I stayed at the desk for 40 min on hold. Tried asking the baggage claim manager for assistance, she laughed and walked away. According to my find your phone, my phone was in Reno then California and now Mexico. I kept trying to have an agent contact the crew or gate agents so that my seat could be thoroughly checked. I was told there is no way to connect this people. Which I find strange. If the pilot's parents died, no one can contact them to give the news? I think not. Currently, I was told that my phone was not on the San Fran Return flight and may still be in Mexico. The issue is the lack of efficiency and protocol for lost items. If the plane was thoroughly checked on 9/02, my phone would be in Seattle (where I am). If it was thoroughly check in Reno or Bakersfield my phone would be closer to being returned to me. Now its in Mexico? I have asked multiple agents what happens when my phone is not returned? What is my compensation? No one has answered my questions. I am very confused and disappointed with this process. Its also very clear the planes are not cleaned or inspected between flights. Attached are photos of my phones journey.

We politely sought assistance and an understanding of the situation from the front desk representative, but we were directed to speak to the Manager. However, instead of offering guidance or explaining the airline's policies, she displayed a complete lack of empathy and customer service skills. She was dismissive and outright rude, showing no willingness to help us despite the circumstances of our slight delay due to a long check-in line. We expected better treatment and a more supportive approach, especially from a manager. Her refusal to consider any alternative solutions and her insistence on offering only one inconvenient option left us feeling disrespected and devalued as customers. To our shock, the Manager canceled our entire trip without any valid reason or explanation, leaving us in tears and feeling completely helpless. Her action disrupted our meticulously planned vacation, including connected flights and multiple reservations, causing immense distress and frustration. During the entire interaction, we maintained our composure and never resorted to using inappropriate language, as the airline staff alleged.

Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said ""Yes"" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false.

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was ""all up in the air"". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink.

I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didn’t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minor’s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, “And she didn’t charge you!” I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representative’s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA. Because of Alaska airlines incompetency, I was not allowed to meet my own child at the gate.

The overhead bins are miniscule and they ran out of space before half the plane was boarded. The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space. The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous. Delta or southwest are far preferable because even when they're awful, they're better than Alaska on a good day.

Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia. Additionally, the fold-out for laptops is only big enough for the PC; you want to use a mouse, well, need to use another fold-out on your right. 2) If want additional elbow room, first-class ticket is necessary 3) Lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped.

2023-01-06,1,10,"""so uncomfortable and sad""",Adrian Gray,"✅ Trip Verified | Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn’t fly there). I’ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I’m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don’t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can’t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I’ve never been offended. I’ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to ”tell on me”. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It’s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don’t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the “rude” passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'Business Class', 'Route': 'Portland to Nome via Anchorage', 'Date Flown': 'January 2023', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 4, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2022-12-19,1,10,"""the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way""",J Tim ,"✅ Trip Verified | Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, ""well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew"". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she ""must be strapped into her own seat"". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says ""nope, strap her in"". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says ""somebody's first flight eh"". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead.

Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska’s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered “their fault”, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn’t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn’t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska’s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that “if we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation”. To which I replied “you should”. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said “what weather?” Again in hadn’t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn’t snowing. She yelled at me and stated “Give me back your tickets”. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated “no” you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn’t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn’t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that “You will be losing a customer, not that you care”. And she said extremely snarky “No, I don’t think we will”. I said “Excuse me, you don’t think you will what?” She reiterated, “I don’t think we will be losing a customer”. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home.

I said I needed help I was told ""you have to put your luggage up here"". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage.

I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up.

They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (I’m annoyed at this point but recognize it’s almost over I’ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times. We are told every 20-40 minutes that it will be another “20-40 minutes” and this goes on for approximately 2 hours. During this time, as a consultation they offer us an 8oz middle school milk carton of water? 9) Finally we get a gate, we pull up, everyone starts standing up getting their bags out of overhead and we all start to notice it’s taking a while to open the door (about 15 minutes at this point) and then the announcement comes on that there is “an issue of a large gap between the plane and the hallway thing that connects to the plane” and at this point the plane is turned off, meaning the AC is turned off and we’re forced to sit there for another 25 minutes before finally getting off the plane.

I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain.

I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted.

I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing.

We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us.

At the end of the day I returned to the airport for my return trip home. I was seated in the third row at a window seat. A man sat next to me on the aisle seat. He started out the flight being fairly silent. After about a half hour into the flight he started to talk out loud mostly using foul language and moving his arms around in a very erratic way. What was worse was his was coughing and hacking without a mask or covering his mouth. Now this behavior continued through most of the flight. He would take breaks every once in a while but get right back into it. I didn’t even feel safe to drink my water. This guy was spewing all over the place. Many people in the first class cabin were aware of what he was doing and they were disturbed by him. I felt unsafe. I got up to speak to the flight attendant in the front of the cabin. I told the flight attendant that the man was creating a disturbance and that I wanted some relief – seat change perhaps. The flight attendant did not make eye contact with me and barely paid attention to what I was saying. He did say that the flight was full and there was no place to move me. He offered no solutions, didn’t seem the least bit interested in assisting me with the situation. Most importantly he didn’t show any empathy to me about what was happening in the cabin. I tapped him on his upper arm and said – thank you – in a sarcastic manner. He immediately recoiled and said that I hit him and he has a witness. He pointed to a female flight attendant behind me. I said that I didn’t hit him. I then just quietly went back to my seat. Moments later the male flight attendant comes down the aisle and points to me and says that when we land I need to stay in my seat. While he was there pointing to me several people in the cabin spoke up and said that he was missing the point in trying to deflect the problem to me. The flight attendant proceeds to say that there was nothing he could do because the man was not drinking or on drugs.  Also the man had been on an early flight with the same flight crew. They already had experience with this man and thought it was alright to let him get on another flight and sit next to someone. The other passengers in the cabin were telling the flight attendant that they wanted to report the whole issue to customer service. We arrive in Seattle. I sat waiting until they directed me to leave the plane where an Alaska Airline representative and several police were waiting for me. We walked out and at the gate were several of the first class cabin passengers speaking with airline representatives. The group was quite animated and angry. The police directed me to an area where we could talk. I recalled the same story that I’ve written here. The police said they were not going to arrest me. Next up was the Alaska Airlines representative. Who started off his speale with – safety is our first priority and thanked me for being an MVP. Then he went on the say that they would review the situation and perhaps ban me from the airline. Bottom line is that if safety in their number one concern then they really didn’t exhibit any behavior that supports that on flight 156 May 24, 2022.

We arrived for our flight nearly 3 hours early. I hate to be late. Our flight was at 11.35 Sunday morning. We arrived at 7.10 am. We grabbed breakfast and everything seemed in order. The flight before ours to Portland left 15 minutes early with no warning and stranded about five people. Our plane to Seattle pulled in and things seemed in order: they loaded the first class and then they made an announcement about the door of the plane not staying open. So there was a delay. But then we noticed them offload the first class, then we noticed them unload our luggage from the plane, they made an announcement that the delay would be an hour, in an hour they delayed it another hour, then another hour, after that they finally announced the cancellation of our flight altogether. It was 5pm at that time. The desk agents were yelling at the passengers over the intercom to stop yelling at them, which I understand but they were not helpful at all. That seems to be the standard with Alaskan Airlines. We made several calls to a customer service only to be transferred so many time until someone pretended not to hear us and hung up on us. They gave us vouchers for taxi to/from the airport to the lodging they set up for us. Firstly, they sent us to the Travelodge in Vegas. Even the taxi driver didn’t want to pull into the parking lot. It was such an unsafe environment (that’s putting it kindly). The desk agent at the motel was so rude. We were exhausted at that point and weren’t even mean to her at all. But she basically threw the room key at us. We went to our room where I slept sitting upright in a chair in front of the door after piling all the luggage in front of the door because door wouldn’t close right. You could see the parking lot through a large gap between the door handle/lock base and the door itself. The door didn’t even lock correctly. There were insects in the tub and running along walls. I cried so hard because I felt so abused by this airline. We paid so much money for our tickets. I will never again fly with them. I am currently on hold with their customer service (right as I write this review) just so I can tell them not to send people to that motel. I have been on hold with them for four hours. Alaskan Airline does not care about its passengers. They’ll take your money and treat you like garbage. Shame on them. Seriously, the worst  experience I have ever had. I’m thankful I made it home.

2022-02-14,1,10,"""couldn’t believe how slow the line was""",Kyle Coon,"Not Verified |  Back in September 2021, my wife and I bought a round trip flight to Seattle, WA from Atlanta, GA with our 1 year-old son for Christmas with my family. Our flight details got changed a few times, but it wasn’t a big deal. Our experience at the Atlanta airport was smooth and virtually frustration-free. After we boarded our plane for Seattle, we had to wait about an hour to take off, but it wasn’t a big deal. Our stay in Washington was great, but it was record-cold and we had 10 inches of snow come down. The night before our flight, we tried to change our tickets because we knew we wouldn’t be able to make it to the airport with the snow and black ice. We tried changing them online, but it wouldn’t let us confirm our change of flight. We had Saver tickets, so normally Alaska doesn’t allow those with Saver tickets to change their flights, but they had a flexible travel policy established for the holiday season. Apparently that doesn’t apply to Saver tickets? It was incredibly frustrating. We stayed up nearly all night trying to get a hold of a customer service agent to talk about our situation, but after being on hold for two hours the line automatically hung up on us. So we canceled the flight. What else were we supposed to do? We were given refunds, so we used the money towards tickets a week from our initial return date, but the tickets were twice the price as the originals. Turns out that Alaska canceled our flight only a few hours after we had canceled our tickets. We figured we could call Alaska after the holiday season and get a refund for the extra charge, considering the extenuating circumstances. Anyway, we scheduled our flight for the morning so that it wouldn’t interfere with our 1 year-old son’s bedtime. The day of the flight comes and our morning flight for 9:15am is canceled and we get stuck on a 3:35pm flight. With a 5 hour flight, and a 3 hour time difference, that would put us in Atlanta at 11:15pm or so. This was incredibly frustrating. We got to the airport about 2 hours before our flight was supposed to leave and went to go get our bags checked. We had checked them online, like the email told us to do, so we figured we could print our bag tags from one of the kiosks and be on our merry way. However, it turns out that if you check your bags from home, you can’t use the kiosks to print your tags and you must wait in line to see an agent who can help you check them. We only figured this out after 30 minutes of trying to print our tags at different kiosks and decided to flag down an agent who told us we had to wait in line. Which line? Well, they never told us, so that was fun to figure out. (Side note: Seattle airport is the hub for Alaska Airlines. You would think that it would be a smooth check-in process). We had to wait an hour in that line to get our bags checked. We figure at this point, we’re going to miss our flight because there’s no way we’re going to make it through security in 30 minutes. We couldn’t believe how slow the line was. It took each agent an unholy amount of time to check bags for a single person. It was ludicrous. Fortunately, they did let us skip a big portion of the security line because we had a baby and a stroller. We rush through security and get stopped because of the baby butt paste we had in our son’s diaper bag.

My complaints: No announcement about the flight was heard (or even made?) in the security area. No attempt at all was made to ensure those who had checked in at the airport made the flight (I was not the only one to miss the flight). No apology was made - I was told to either rent a car and drive to Santa Barbara or wait for a flight the next day, which they made sound like I should be thankful they booked for me. No acknowledgement of the airline being at fault for any of this or desire to improve. I called to request a full refund given that I had to rent a car to drive to San Diego that night. They told me I should have canceled the flight that they had rebooked for me 24hr in advance, you mean before the flight was even re-booked? And that booking was made under the pressure of the moment with a screaming 1-year old in my arms while I was trying to consider how to make work the next day? And responsibility ultimately lay with me. I had to be back home for work which is why I had to rent a car and drive, but more than that, this is a flight I was hoping to take monthly in the future. If traveling with Alaska arrive well ahead of time and even then don't expect any support if you miss your flight due to airport - or airline-related failures. I have never had such an unpleasant experience with any airline and I'm frankly shocked that zero effort was made to account for paying passengers who were checked-in at the airport before a flight even began boarding.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'San Luis Obispo to San Diego', 'Date Flown': 'February 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I signed up for their credit card with one thought in mind - getting to Australia first-class for a prolonged vacation. My wife and I booked cruise tickets for 2020. Six months beforehand, I tried to get tickets but there were no FC tickets available. I was told I waited too long. So, we delayed the trip (probably a good thing thinking about it) so as to get tickets the day they opened. Lo and behold, no first-class tickets on the very first day I could book travel. This time I was told that I was too early and that they could only release tickets that they were given by partner airlines (eg none). I complained and was politely told that they only had to honor the mile for tickets that were ""available"" which they defined as those given to them. Now, having waited for my grievance to be heard, there are no more coach tickets available. And only on the days that my wife and I want to fly and two days on either side (what a coincidence). What I've been able to glean from case law, the airlines can promise whatever they want and change the rules whenever they want (and the courts back them up).

I then asked for a supervisor. The gate manager came over looked at our reservation and attempted to put us on a 10pm flight with another airline she stated “It’s first class and you can be seated together but we can’t guarantee that flight won’t cancel so your other option is to take the seats we assigned then, call the 800 number to discuss a refund and good luck because this is happening with all the airlines”. At this point I became very upset and loudly told her this was not ok and expressed how I felt”. In hindsight I am sorry for my behavior and should not have taken my frustration out on her. She was doing the best she could given the circumstances. In a normal situation I would have cancelled our trip but unfortunately my husband had appointments schedule for the next two weeks in Costa Rica that we could not reschedule. We accepted the seat assignment but we’re not happy. As we were waiting to board I told my husband I was cancelling my credit card. The person who was boarding the passengers very loudly and extremely rudely told me to calm down (I wasn’t talking loudly nor was I even looking or talking to or at her)and would not allow us to board until I calmed down (I again was not showing any signs of anger or frustration).At this point I was near tears and did not reply. I simply walked away. My husband attempted to talk to her and she rudely told him no one is boarding. When I heard this I asked for her supervisor. The supervisor walked over and started reprimanding me about how they have been up since three o’clock that morning, they don’t have to put up with this (again at this time I was not even acknowledging her, was not even talking) and told my husband (again I was not talking or even acknowledging her or anyone else) she would take our bags off the plane and refund our tickets if I was going to cancel my credit card. I refused to even look engage in conversation with her. This action seemed to infuriate her and she demanded I “look at her while she was talking to me” then a proceeded to threaten not to allow us to board.

Some of the employees were helpful and kind but some were extremely rude and clearly stressed. The cherry on top was that they lost our bag with our ski gear in it (the whole point of the trip was to ski) and we still haven’t heard anything back from them about our lost bag (they lost our bag a week and a half ago). Also when we did finally get on a flight is was SO dirty. They clearly do not clean their planes at all.. which is pretty concerning during a pandemic. Attached is a picture of the Lysol wipe I used to clean only my seat.

Then I asked about my refund and she proceeded to cancel my hotel reservation telling me they don’t give vouchers if you received a refund. When I explained I followed exactly what the customer service agent told me to do she ignored me and continued to repeat the same thing. I had to find and pay for my own hotel and taxis.

2021-10-28,1,10,"""pure torture with this airline""",J Hellon,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family of four was returning from a trip to Seattle (Tuesday) with five checked in bags. Only three made it. That stuff happens in the industry and that is not my complaint. What occurred over the next 36 hours was pure torture with this airline. It started with no one being present to help us report the missing bags. So I used the telephone number and engaged with a very pleasant person who took down all of the information and assigned me an incident number, sending me an email with a portal connection that I could check on the status of the bags. No one contacted me whatsoever during the day and only later at 7:30 PM (Wednesday) did I call them and ask what the status was. It was clear to me that the person that I was speaking with, who was again very pleasant on the phone, was simply a part-time person obviously working from home and had a real disconnect with anyone in the baggage department at Alaska in EWR. In fact, there is no baggage department at Newark Airport for Alaska. They only come on a few minutes before a flight arrival and leave within 10 minutes after the last bag is discharged. All I received were promises that they would reach out to the baggage people when they reported for duty and make sure that the bags were delivered to my home. Every time I spoke with anyone I received the same story. At 1130 the next day (Thursday) I finally was able to reach a manager. I told her that we were now going on 36 hours and I did not see any effort whatsoever by the airline to get the bags back to me. The bags were placed on a later flight and at least I had comfort in knowing that they were in the airport. The manager promised me that she would call when persons were present in the baggage room at 1 o'clock. I did not hear from her and called her at just before 2 o'clock. She admitted that she had not had a chance to call but asked me to be placed on hold and she would call down there right away. After a few minutes she got back on and told me that no one was in the baggage room to pick up the phone. This was standard procedure amongst all personnel. This included a real estate broker working out of Putnam County, New York who apparently is doing customer relations part-time for this airline who sent me an email advising me that they were not responsible for the bags since they were now being held by another airline. I sent her an email asking her to call me but I never did receive a call. She was probably out showing a new listing for a booming real estate business here in the Northeast. All of these people had a chance to make a difference in an individual's life. All of them failed and it is a reflection on this airline that there is no connection between their baggage customer staff and the actual key people that are there 20 minutes before and airline lands and 10 minutes after to work together. It is a major disconnect. I doubt their new CEO will be aware of this. I know that he only took the position as of March of this year. Unfortunately for him, this was my first experience with Alaska Airlines. It will be my last. I will say that the individuals that I spoke to by telephone were all very pleasant but they had absolutely no ability to help me because of the clear disconnect between what they can do and their need to speak with people on the ground that are the real individuals that can help out. In the end, I took the 1 Hour drive back to the airport to get the two bags and will drive the hour back.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Seattle to Newark', 'Date Flown': 'October 2021', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

My husband explained he was trying to help our children. The flight attendant then told us we were going to be a problem. This made us uneasy. Right after this another flight attendant started yelling at another passenger about their mask and threatened to extradite the man. At this point I had the worst feeling about the flight. We settled into the flight. My children were doing great and were behaving the best they had on any flight. My son's mask was a little loose. I had given him the 32 degree masks from Costco and they slip. The flight attendant reminded my son to pull up his mask, which he did. Not too long after the flight attendant came to me and told me he had reminded us a lot to put up our masks. My husband told him it had only been two times. The steward began to argue with my husband. I told the steward a firm thank you and he left. At this point I didn't dare rest my eyes. I kept checking my children's masks. My oldest sons mask did slip down again but I would hurry and make sure he had it up. Not once did we ever refuse to wear our masks. Not once were we unruly or trying to be a problem on the flight. We were in the last row of the plane right next to the flight attendant cabin. We could hear them talking bad about the passengers and how awful they were. They seemed really worked up. I then heard the steward say they might have law enforcement waiting for someone at the end of the flight. I heard another female flight attendant say, "" I didn't ask for that to happen."" He responded, ""Well it's done!"" In the back of my mind I was thinking is he talking about us? I quieted my fears and thought it must be the man they had threatened to extradite. By the conversations I was picking up in the back from the flight attendants it seemed like this particular flight attendant really enjoyed the power and was excited to watch seeing someone get kicked off. It was like he could use it at his next gathering of flight attendants where they could tell the crazy stories of what had happened to them. Not okay at the expense of a family just trying to get home with as little problems as possible. Well luckily it wasn't law enforcement, but it was Alaska Airlines employees who handed us a letter that said our connecting flight had been canceled and we are now banned from flying with Alaska Airlines. We tried to tell them that we had tried to comply and that it had been exaggerated, but they wouldn't even let us talk. So here we are a young family of 5, stranded in LA. The same day flights were all $1000 for each family member. We rode a bus to Enterprise who was all out of one way cars. Luckily, there was an amazing employee there. We told him what happened. He got us a van even though he knew he might get in trouble. Honestly, it healed my heart to see someone care after we were treated so badly. We then drove home and arrived safely the next day.

Not a huge slip in quality, but still noticeable when my prior experiences flying on Alaska have been excellent. The check-in agents in Houston were grumpy and discourteous, not only did not exchange pleasantries with passengers, they just weren't pleasant. On the flight from Houston Bush to Seattle-Tacoma, the jet was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. I say it was the second or third dirtiest jet I've ever flown on. The catering in Houston had dropped the ball on some meals that passengers had ordered, including mine, but the crew offered for me to have another available meal that cost the same, which I accepted - and which was tasty. The crew were polite, focused and professional, but not very friendly. Just robotic. They weren't rude, but they seemed kind of intense, which is something I didn't expect from Alaska. I also purchased in-flight WiFi, which turned out to be slow, it didn't stream the videos I wanted and didn't let me even go a simple Google search. I'm still not happy about that. Now, the flight from Seattle-Tacoma to Portland was better, quicker boarding, much nicer and cleaner plane, much more cheerful and appreciative flight attendants. So, for now, I will continue to fly them when I can and be a Mileage Plus member for the foreseeable future, but Alaska may sadly have lost a slight bit of its way during a pandemic which has required them to reduce service and cut costs otherwise, and it's really a shame.

So I naturally ignored the email. Cut to 6pm, when I am informed the 1030pm flight has been canceled and I am flying out the next day at 530pm. After getting on with reservations to change my flight out to 930am the following morning and maybe salvage some of my plans (I couldn't ultimately), I didn't receive a confirmation email about my itinerary. I called back a few hours later and requested it again. Still did not receive an email. Had to call a third time -- it's 1130pm by this point -- and demand an email to be sent while I sat on the phone. However, all that was sent was a receipt, but I was assured I was on the flight. Cut to 8am Sunday, the following morning at SFO and I can't check in at a kiosk. After an hour of standing in line at the zoo in front of the Alaska Air check in stations, I get my boarding passes and am told to call Customer Care (closed till Monday) about being reimbursed for everything I spent while having to stay the extra night in San Francisco. This is important -- I asked how to deal with reimbursement. They told me just to call customer care with no instruction -- all operators, all people I talked to in Alaska air outfits at the airport. So I call customer care. They honor the vouchers they suspiciously sent me earlier in the day on Saturday -- though the operator gets super defensive when I ask why the flight was canceled, she said crew issues, and I ask if they knew that was going to happen with the voucher email -- but demand ALL reimbursements have ITEMIZED receipts. NO ONE told me to do this -- I had receipts for everything but not all of them were itemized. Finally the operator admitted to me that Alaska had limited staff, tons of layoffs, tons of people retiring, etc and it becomes a domino effect down to the customers. However, they still refused to reimburse for the full amount. Despite them canceling the flight. Despite giving zero instruction about how to properly get reimbursed. Despite wasting hours of my time just to get myself home. Dont fly with them until they get their house is in order (that will probably be a while). And if you do, there's a good chance your flight will be canceled -- I'd actually flown with them a month before and they did the same thing, only booked my family on a flight just a few hours later, so it was not a big deal.

2021-05-07,1,10,"""said that the markings were wrong""",Stan Johnson,"Not Verified |  On Monday morning (05/03/21) I checked my baggage in at Spokane International airport. Alaska Airlines (ASA) accepted my checked baggage and TSA screened and accepted my baggage for airline transportation. One of these items was a box of factory sealed ammunition that weighed approximately 25 pounds. My baggage was transferred to another ASA airplane in Seattle and transported to Juneau where I had a three hour layover after which I would board another ASA flight to my final destination in Sitka. During the boarding process in Sitka, I was called to the ASA customer service desk in the departure lounge. Once at the customer service desk a rather rude customer service agent informed me that my ammunition would not be allowed to travel to Sitka. When I asked why, she stated that the box (baggage) ""had the wrong markings on it"". When I inquired as to what the wrong markings were, she couldn't give me an answer, stating only that an airline baggage handler had said that the markings were wrong. I then assured her that I was well aware of FAA, TSA, and ASA regulations regarding the transportation of ammunition and that my baggage met all of those requirements. About that time she started to become very rude and, with a raised voice, informed me that my baggage didn't meet the requirements. I then asked her to explain to me how it was that both the TSA agents and the ASA customer service agents in Spokane cleared my ammunition for transportation on ASA earlier the same day. She defiantly stated that the people in Spokane were wrong. Following that comment, she stated that I needed to pull my face mask up over my nose, which had slipped down during our conversation. Since the municipality of Juneau owns the airport, it really wasn't her place to try and assert authority over my mask. When questioned further, she stated that I was welcome to exit security, repackage my ammunition and then check it in again for transportation with ASA. I stated that since the flight was already boarding and there was only one flight a day to my residence, that was not a feasible option. After I boarded the plane I placed a call to someone in Juneau to attempt to pick up my ammunition so at least the ASA baggage handler wouldn't get to keep it. The most logical conclusion I can come to is that someone at ASA in Juneau wanted my ammunition and timed the notification to me that it wouldn't be allowed on the flight so that I wouldn't have time to deal with retrieving it. It would be nice if Alaska Air would compensate me for my troubles and $1,000 loss but I won't hold my breath. If they don't I will go out of my way to give my business to small regional airlines and other major airlines, even if they cost more!",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 737-800', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Spokane to Sitka', 'Date Flown': 'May 2021', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 4, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

They don’t care about their customers. Due to incompetency of their employees I couldn’t fly home and spend holiday time with my family. I bought non-refundable air ticket because I was flying to the country where I had citizenship and all citizens could enter the country without any restrictions. It was in the very end of December 2020. At the check-in an employee told me I couldn`t go because to enter the country I was going required COVID test. I it was not applicable to me because I have citizenship of that country. Then she called for another employee, they talked and this time they told me I couldn`t go because for the rules of their Alaska Airline to have COVID test to go on board. At the Alaska Airlines website there was no any information that anyone was required any test to go on board. And the first leg of the flight Alaska Airline was to perform was not international, it was from San-Francisco to New-York. I was to change the airline in New-York and proceed internationally. I can`t understand what was the ground for such decision from those employees and where they got this information they didn’t tell me. Sometimes I think they did it for fun. Or it was awful incompetency and irresponsibility. I lost $600 air ticket and Airbnb reservation. My plans to spend holidays with my family were ruined. I came home and wrote a letter Alaska Airlines customer service and asked them to send me the information where it stated that passengers had to have COVID test. They sent me a link where they suggested me to find out myself if I was eligible to fly without test. Following the link I received the information that test WAS NOT necessary for me. I sent them those results. I received apologies and $100 discount for the next travel with them. This is ridiculous, Alaska Airlines!

2021-03-19,1,10,"""I don’t think I can ever go back""",Stockton Walbeck,"✅ Trip Verified |  A sad day today for me. Wish I wasn’t writing this review. Been an Alaska flyer for years now. Have always loved it. Great prices. Great service. Today I don’t think I can ever go back. It’s a principle thing for me. Being a businessman, I highly value how a business treats a customer. We value our customers and put them first in EVERYTHING. Today had one of the most horrendous flights I’ve ever experienced. Halfway through my flight from Honolulu to LAX the flight attendant approached me as my mask was down after just finishing eating some snacks. As if from a hawk from her nest made sure to immediately address my mask being down and almost in a commond said “Put your mask on.” Not a please. Not a “hey sir, you’re our valued customer and you help pay my bills but we have to abide by the law, can you please put your mask on.” It was a “Put your mask on now and I’m not leaving til you do.” kind of a command. Disgusted, I put my mask up, only to find her on the prowl just 3 minutes later to see if I was abiding by her commands. My mask had fell down below my nose just a touch as it does normally when you chew and breathe and sleep on a plane. And she had no problem tapping me on the shoulder to say “Mask up above your nose now. This is your second warning and if I have to come back a 3rd time I will issue a warrant.” At this point I was baffled that humanity has swooped this low. I don’t care if it’s in a pandemic, or a national crisis, when I’m a paying customer there is some degree of customer service and generosity that is expected. No matter how small it might be. I don’t even need her to like me or even act like she likes me. But commanding me to take action like I’m an obedient dog awaiting orders was another level.  I don’t even know what kind of warrant she was referring to, but she surely felt good letting me know she had the authority, power, and pride to do it. Just sad. For me, this is all it takes to have me completely switch over to a different airline and never consider Alaska again. Our family has been faithful members for decades flying first class with the miles that we’ve accumulated and Alaska has finally reached it’s lowest point. I wish it wasn’t just one flight attendant. Because an hour later, yet another attendant came over, tapped me to wake ME up, and asked if the man next to me was apart of our party. I told her no and she reached across me to shake the 70 year old man fast asleep next to me awake and said “SIR, you need to put your mask above your nose.” As if I was absolutely disgusted enough, I wanted to tell this lady off so bad.  COVID has caused good people to completely throw all logic out the window and abandon good manners and any sense of politeness or respect. And it’s all in the “Name of the law.” Look, I get it. You have to follow laws. But why throw out your entire sense of manners and humanity?

I tried to tell him that things are different now thanks to Covid-19 and we all need to adjust a bit in regards to changes. He was not going to change his mind though. I guess I am just lucky in regards to my flights on Alaska. I read other trip reports on this forum giving very low ratings and I cannot believe what I am reading.

Received a “looking forward to the flight” that included some “what to expect details” email 3 days prior to our flight. On the evening before our flight I log in to check in and get a pop-up to call customer service, or check in at the airport. Thank God, I had time to sit on hold for an hour, because that’s when I learned no Alaska flights were going into PAE. The CSR advised me numerous times we should have gotten an email. No matter how many times I said we had not, and in fact had gotten a confirmation instead. For the record, had we waiting to check in at the airport, we wouldn’t have gotten the 1 comparable flight that day. We rebooked BUR-SEA.  As we walked on, they announced the back lav sink is broken, the WiFi is broken and the stewardess did a grumpy-dad-glovebox number on two of the overhead cabinets.

If I had known I was going to have to fly the cheaper itinerary I would have booked that in the first place and saved myself the money.

My flight was changed by the airlines at least 7 times by the airlines in a 2 month period. I get it. The problem was that I was never contacted by the airlines to see how these changes worked with my schedule. There were 5 people traveling together to a remote Alaskan fishing lodge with a tight schedule and limited access to this isolated facility. These changes were never communicated to me or asked which option benefited me rather than the airline random movement. I had also misplaced my driver’s license upon arrival in Seattle for a long layover before continuing to my final destination. I contacted TSA to make I would have the needed material for departure and satisfied them. When I contacted Alaskan to make sure we were good, I was told it would be an additional $200 expense since they had to add two additional sentences to my ticket. This is only a chance to grab more money. I refused to pay and ultimately got on the plane. This was nothing more than an attempt by Alaska Airline to “stick it” to their clients when it was not even necessary. On the return home flight, we had a 45 minute lay over in Seattle between connections. We landed on time and could not get the gate because a plane was at the gate. We let the flight attendant know that we had 5 people making a tight connection and another party of 15 was also trying to make a tight connection to Sacramento. Once we made it off the plane and to a neighboring gate, the Alaska Airlines flight was at the gate and not pulled away. They refused to let us on our flight and would not let us speak to a supervisor. The other group had the flight held for them and made their connection.

I was moved up to First, one row in front of where I had been sitting. The service was fine but the ""food"" left a lot to be desired. It was some sort of small box with not much in the way of food inside. As I recall there were chips, crackers, smoked creamy cheese and small salami pieces within. I managed to eat it all but did enjoy the wine with it. The First Class FA made the trip very enjoyable. After serving everyone, she came and sat with me for a little while and we shared our love of aviation over the years. From what I saw, the rest of the crew was top notch as well.

2020-07-04,1,10,"""profits over customer safety""",Curt Reesor,"✅ Trip Verified |  Most of us appreciate the fact that during this pandemic we live with uncertainty and risk. I accept this, but take reasonable precautions to stay safe. With this in mind I choose Alaska for a recent flight from Portland to Orange County. My risk analysis was heavily influenced by the airline’s stated policy that passengers would be seated with an open seat next them, thereby significantly reducing the density of people, and creating more space between passengers. Separate seats were booked for myself and three other family members. We were all a bit nervous about the prospect of being in a confined space with strangers during Covid times, but took solace in the promise that the airline had a safety policy of spacing people and reducing overall passenger density. I calculated that my family’s “bubble” would be a space of four rows (the plane has two seats per row). We’d each have the option of sitting adjacent to the window, with an empty seat between us and the aisle. Imagine my disappointment when the boarding agent scanned my ticket and informed me that our seats were changed. Alaska had unilaterally decided that we were a group that must be packed in side by side. This was the case for many other travelers on this plane. Mandatory reseating. End result: a very full plane, zero personal space for those sitting in the aisle, more people impacting the restroom, more people in line, more hands on the fixtures, more risk for my family. And one more thing: more profit for Alaska Airlines. My decision to take this flight was a calculated risk. I weighed the facts based on what I thought was an honest agreement between me and the airlines regarding personal space and overall airplane density. I feel duped. When boarding, I told the agent we do not want to be reseated in a tighter cluster. The response: “sorry sir, we need to make room for more people”. Thank you Alaska for reorienting me on your company’s policy: profits over customer safety. I appreciate that airlines are struggling more than most businesses to financially survive the COVID crisis. But I do not appreciate being mislead. Airlines have a responsibility for their customer’s safety, and a moral responsibility to honest and transparent when communicating their policies.

They use air miles as a retention tool, because giving a passenger air miles doesn't monetarily cost them anything. I recently used 160,000 air miles - which I earned with my butt in an Alaska Airline seat - to travel to Spain in May 2020. Although the hotels were non-refundable, I purchased a travel protection program, which informed me my miles would be refundable should I not be able to travel due to a health related issue. Then, COVID-19 hit. Delta airlines, with whom I had non-refundable tickets - issued me a full monetary refund. Two hotels in Spain, for which I had non-refundable reservations, refunded me. Alaska Airlines has refused. The only refund I requested of Alaska Airlines is the air miles I used to ""purchase"" the hotels. When you use air miles for hotels, you also have to spend a very small portion of money, which I did, and which I did not ask for a refund. I was willing to lose the $500 dollars, but not my air miles. What has been the answer of Alaska Airlines? ""I'm sorry Sir, there is nothing we can do.""

When my husband booked our flights he called Alaska Airlines and followed their directions of booking us together on all flights and booking a different flight when he advised he would have to fly to Dallas from Phoenix. When we checked in, about three hours early and had the attention of the counter agent, who we advised my husband was not flying with me on our companion airfare. The agent said, “That was not a problem as we had paid for both seats.” As I was in boot casts on both feet, and having to use crutches to walk, the agent gave my husband a boarding pass telling him that way he could escort me to the gate helping with my carry-on. he also gave my husband directions to board Spirit Airlines which was located in a different terminal. After boarding the flight, which was quite a challenge being in the condition I was in, and the doors closed and ready for takeoff, I was approached and made to feel like I was some kind of thief and forced to leave the flight. I was told that because I was not the primary flyer on the companion airfare I could not continue on the flight as my husband was not with me. I explained that the companion airfare was from the same credit card I was an account holder on. I was told I was going to have to buy a full fare ticket, to which I asked to buy the seat I was sitting in and not be removed from the flight. I was told that was not going to happen and I had to get up and leave this flight and I would not be flying on this plane.  I was forced to de-board in Phoenix, from a direct flight to Anchorage, with a long layover with no offer of assistance. I cannot explain how vulnerable, alone, and at risk I felt during that six hours before I could board another flight, which I paid for with the same credit card the companion airfare was purchased on.

I was told on flight 115, before I was forced to deboard, that I had to be the primary flyer, and since been told the same. Why didn’t the individual my husband talked to when he called and booked the flights tell him the same, why didn’t the agent advise the change when we checked in? Why was I not allowed to purchase my seat on flight 115?

Alaska Airlines has almost exclusively been our airline of choice as noted by the almost 600K airlines miles we have on our credit card. So many opportunities for Alaska Airlines to be compassionate and to have put yourself in my shoes and help, but the agent that removed me from the flight was very short with me, rude in how she spoke with me, and would not listen or work with me at all.

While US-based airlines often lag behind their international counterparts in terms of providing modern amenities and efficient and pleasant customer service, it has been my experience that Alaska is one of the better US-based airlines. I've flown them over the last five years and always have had positive experiences. Their economy seats aren't exactly luxurious, but their planes have always been extremely clean. Their flights, sans their puddle-jumper ones, usually have a great assortment of on-flight entertainment. Staff, whether at check-in, the gate, or on the plane, are almost always pleasant, courteous, helpful, and professional. The only exception was the gruff and rather odd check-in agent in Honolulu (no surprise, it's a terrible airport with miserable staff) who was skeptical about accepting my checked bag because of something on my boarding pass that he couldn't really articulate, but, nevertheless, he demanded to see my driver's license. I have no idea what that was all about and what his problem was, since I entered my name, address and TSA Pre-Check details correctly when I booked the flight. Otherwise, the check-in processes, whether online or at the airport, are normally efficient. The one time I was delayed on Alaska, about three years ago, the staff handled passenger inquiries with class and professionalism - much more so than I would expect on airlines such as United, American, Spirit, and Southwest. Their prices are often competitive with the likes of United and Southwest, especially for West Coast flights. It's a shame that Alaska focuses primarily on the West Coast, plus Chicago, Dallas and New York, because, based on my experiences, they'd be a great travel host for foreigners touring the U.S. Just try to avoid the odd check-in dude in Honolulu.",yes,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Honolulu to Dallas/Fort Worth via Seattle', 'Date Flown': 'February 2019', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

So we deplaned, and were advised to go to the customer service desk near the gate. Low and behold, there was a long line. It took me roughly 90min to get to the front of the line. During that 90min wait, I was automatically rebooked to the same flight the next day, which I was not about to risk another cancellation. When it was my turn to get helped, the agent said there was no other alternative. He ""claimed"" all nonstop flights to Spokane were overbooked, Spokane via Portland and/or Boise were sold out. I did a search on the Alaska Air app and saw he wasn't telling the truth. I saw there was room in economy on a Seattle-Portland-Spokane flight, and he wouldn't rebook me to those flights because it was ""inaccurate"". He told me to take my current rebooking or leave it in the rudest tone. They wouldn't even accommodate a hotel reservation, and expected me to wait in the airport for over 24hrs to board the flight I was rebooked on again. I wasn't about to do that, so I reserved a room at a nearby hotel. I didn't leave the airport until almost 2am at this point on Xmas Eve. At the hotel, I was given the number for customer care by a very nice woman. I called, requested a call back due to extended wait times. I was called back, and the agent was very helpful. I told him what I've experienced, how aggravated I was and how the agent at the airport couldn't rebook me because of inaccuracy. Surprisingly, he was very sympathetic about how I didn't want to risk getting on the same flight and have it cancelled again. He went above and beyond by getting me on a seat on a late morning Spokane flight in first class. I was thankful for his generosity.

The agent said they would most likely put it on the earliest flight from PDX, around 8am the next day, and they would bring it to the front desk of the hotel. They didn't. They put it on a flight to Seattle instead. So, I'm in this hotel, my toiletries et al are in Seattle and I don't know that I'll get the bag before I fly back the next day so I had to replace the items at the shop in the hotel.

His best friend's parents were taking him to Hawaii as a graduation present from the year before and his girlfriend was going to go with him. She purchased her ticket back in March, and then because of school issues, was not able to go, so they asked my son if he would be willing to pay the $125 change fee and go with to Hawaii. Being a 17 year old, he was in. When she (girlfriend) called back on the 16th of August to make the change, the agent informed her that there is an additional $223 fare change fee on top of that. Being she was an 18-year-old going to college Freshman, she was shocked and paid the fees without consulting anyone. She then contacted my 17-year-old son to let him know about the additional fee. So on top of the $680 ticket, there is now a $125 fee change fee, a $223 fare difference fee, and he didn't know what to do because it was already a done deal. I told them not to worry and I would give customer service a call. I got a lot of run around talk. I heard a lot of ""there is nothing we can do""! I asked if this was purely company policy and they said yes. I asked to speak to a manager that had the authority to make changes, and I was put in touch with her. She said, ""There is nothing I can do!"" I asked her if that was a company policy or the law. She said company policy. I said, then don't tell me there is nothing you can do, tell me there is nothing you are willing to do. I get it that there are people out there that will try and take advantage of a company and manipulate the system. I am wondering, however, why a $960 million dollar company is excited to take advantage of an 18-year-old Freshman going to college, and a 17-year-old senior in high school, why would I ever fly them again? The sad part is, I had a bad experience with them 4 years ago when my daughter was a part of the State Sports Committee and needed to change a flight, they were no different. Gouging teenagers that had valid reasons to change tickets, that Alaska Airlines already owned. It's not like they were out anything, they just needed to change a name. Instead of this person flying, this other person is flying. They tried to make us feel better because apparently we should have been charged (2) $125 change fees plus the airfare difference and they only charged us one. Well, I hope this helped build the shareholder confidence in your company because I will do everything within my power to not fly Alaska and never get your credit card. Thanks for taking advantage of a 17 & 18-year-old innocence.

We arrived nice and early to Seattle airport for a short hop to San Francisco onwards to Manchester, UK. We were first told to wait for the kiosks to check into our flight (check-in on-line was unavailable the night before) Once we had finished on the kiosks a ticked was issued saying our passports would need to be checked. We were then told we needed to stand in the “Assistance” lane. This lane was filled with every man and his dog (literally) there were 5 desks serving on the line we were in - only 2 of the 5 were occupied with staff (this was Memorial Weekend). The line moved very slowly as every person in this general assistance line had a long issue to resolve for example not having a Canadian eTa People we’re dropping out of this line like flies as they to were missing their flights due to incompetence from Alaska airways with regard to staffing levels on such a busy weekend. When we eventually got to the front of the queue after nearly 2 hours we had missed our first flight to San Francisco. I asked if a later flight was available at first the lovely and very apologetic staff member said yes and then made a call. After that call she was told us she was told to tell us we needed to call Condor/Thomas Cook to get us a new connecting flight as our flights were originally booked with them. After 20 minutes on hold Condor/Thomas Cook told us that it was ALASKA Airways would need to book us on to the new flights. By this time we had now missed that next available flight We were forced with either a $7000 economy flight later that day with another airline or fly home the next day from Vancouver which was a 4 hour taxi/coach ride away for $1400 total (including extra hotel stay). Our Tavel insurance would not cover the additional cost as airline incompetence is not covered. I complained to Alaska Airways who offered a $50 discount per person on flights with them.

I did and they refused to seat us together on the 6 hour cross-country flight, but were happy to add stand-by passengers to the flight and offered to try to seat them all together! I then asked the flight attendants who nastily also refused. I pleaded with them that my kids were too young, esp, my 5 year old, to sit without me, and with strangers for this long flight. They rudely told me tough luck. I was panicking then, but I knew it was best to stay calm and polite. When I asked again, the agent told me that I might prefer de-planing and explaining my problem to TSA. It was exasperating. The Alaska Newark crew - all of them at the gate and in the plane - were nasty, taking advantage of post-911 TSA threats for any reason. I wrote a letter when we returned and got a canned response--with $75 vouchers which are absolutely useless - you can't use them for regularly priced tickets. If I wanted to buy a $2000 one hour flight which is priced at $49 by Southwest, the vouchers work.

And since my beloved daughter keeps buying me the ticket to come visit her, I keep having to fly with them. But oh my goodness have I had it! This is the second time that my daughter has had to change my flight and they suggest her ""best"" option is a way where she not only ends up paying the $125 (I think) change fee, but also ends up buying a whole new ticket! And this time, today, when she tried to call and cancel twenty minutes after buying the new ticket, they told her she had to pay again to cancel her brand new purchase! This is the only airline I've hear charges you to cancel a purchase within 24 hours. The attitude she got not only from the customer service agent, but from the manager who was nothing but a waste of time. She told my daughter she ""had to listen to the recording of her request to make sure what had happened, and then she would call her back"". Really? Please! Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. The so called lower fares are not worth dealing with a bunch of ""agents"" that have zero intention in offering any customer service. The only thing in their minds is how can they get more money out of you. This is the second time in 3 months they do this to my daughter. This time it hit me hard because my daughter just had a baby, they just left the hospital after having the baby in the NICU for a whole week and she really needed my help for a longer period of time.

It is nearly impossible for us to catch another flight our of Seattle, but very easy out of Kauai or Honolulu.

I call (mainly to inquire about my other delayed flight) and ask if there’s any upgrade options.

As soon as I left for airport at 3:50pm I checked for the status and it was delayed by almost 2 hours (new departure time: 7:38pm). I had just left so we came back home. I then left for the airport at 6pm. At 6:09pm I got a notification that it is now departing at 7:12pm. Unfortunately there was a crash on the freeway so I could only reach the airport by 6:45pm. I tried speaking to an agent and after 4-5 tries with their automated speech input system I finally got through to an agent. She told me she can put me on a later airline (departing at 9:30pm) but I would have to pay $50, since I should never have turned around, and actually stayed at the airport waiting for the flight to depart. Since I HAD to be in Vegas that night I agreed. When I finally got to the airport and my gate I saw there was another flight #1940 departing at 7:35pm. The agent never even mentioned this airline to me. And to add to my woes, the 9:30pm flight was delayed by almost 45 minutes. we finally landed at 11:40pm, and by the time I got to my hotel it was 1:00am. I had an important meeting at 9am. They changed the flight departure time to be 30 minutes early with just an hour to go. They not only asked me to pay up for their mistakes, but hid info from me about a flight earlier than the 9:30pm one. This not only shows their dishonesty, but also utter disregard for their customers' time. It was my wedding anniversary and I wasted 4 hours away from my husband basically haggling with Alaska to just do their job. Their 9:30 pm flight was delayed as well, for what reason, nobody knows. Even my return flight from Vegas to SFO is delayed by about 30 minutes, and I am here at the airport since 6pm, as per their demand of being 2 hours early. Not just this, my flight from SFO to Seattle last year was delayed 4 times. Even now, when I am just checking their other flights (in case they show their true colors and delay my flight even further) everything is delayed! How can an airline be so incompetent?!

At the time I was totally fine with this (traveled enough to know). Approximately two hours into my wait I received another notice that the flight would be delayed an additional two hours. I decided to go home and planned to arrive an hour before boarding time. After arriving at the airport I was told that the plane (which was suppose to have arrived in Seattle at 12:00) had not left the airport and another plane was being sent our way. Seven hours after my flight was suppose to depart, we had left the runway. Upon arriving in Seattle we made a phone call to Alaska Airlines about our connecting flight, their response “We don’t know”. After 2 hours of being in Seattle we had received a call from Alaska stating that our connecting flight would not leave until 7:55 (24 hours after our original leave time). At this time we booked a hotel room and an additional car rental (on top of the one we canceled). We arrived at our final destination without any additional complications, but lost an entire day with family and friends for the holidays. The experience did not end here. Upon my journey back home, we had a delay of approximately 1 hour. When we boarded the plane we were told that we had an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes to departure and could leave the plane if we wanted. I am currently sitting in Denver waiting to hear about when we would be boarding, so far all we know is that we will be arriving in Seattle at 10:30 but when we ask when we will be departing we get “I don’t know”.

They haven't taken the time to remove all the old Virgin decorations, so it's a terrible mix of Alaska's and Virgin and it just feels odd. The seats are poorly arranged which gave a lot of legroom, too much because you couldn't even reach the seat in front of you for the pockets, and there was no room to store your bag under that seat. Seriously, the only way I can explain how bad the plane was is to say it looked like it was bought at a garage sale. Don't expect help from the gate agents, it seems the only requirement for their jobs is apathy. I arrived 10 minutes before the posted time on the gate and they wouldn't let me on the plane. The plane was sitting at the gate as they typed up a new ticket for tomorrow. Other airlines have let me go, or walked me down. I walked away from the Alaska gate staring at the plane sitting at the gate but I couldn't board it.

That was nice. Then we were seated on the plane, parked on the tarmac, for over 3 hours but they were great about it! The entire (Sea-Tac) airport was fogged in, no flights were allowed to take off or land. About 30 minutes after the initial delay, we were told by the Captain that we had the option to get off the plane while we were waiting for the fog to lift - but don't go too far, cause when it's our turn, we're taking off. The Captain updated us about every half hour as to our status, weather, etc. During each of the updates, we were reminded of the option to get off the plane if we wanted. Amazingly, not one person got off. I was pretty comfortable, and I think it was just the comfort of knowing I could get off the plane if I wanted to, kept me calm and comfortable. Then after maybe an hour, the stewardesses got on the P.A. and initiated a guessing game, with various snacks as prizes, until the prizes ran out. That was cool, an amusing distraction. Then, finally the fog lifted, and instead of being anywhere from number 25-40 in line for take-off, we were #4, as a result of nobody getting off the plane, we were ready to roll. A few ten minutes later, we were in the air. So, fast check-in, helpful gate assistance, pilot with options, and fun, creative stewardesses made a huge difference from what could have been a long, sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours, claustrophobic, trapped on a plane into a delay that was broken up with announcements, games, snacks, etc. and ended with a smooth flight, and a great landing - in fog at our destination!

Several of us agreed we couldn't do that, mainly the two flights of steps. I ordered a wheel chair to take me down the elevator to the lower level, across the tarmac, and up the ramp into the plane.

N gate 12A had hardly any places for people to sit and wait, and people were sitting on the floor all around that gate.

Now, what I alluded to regarding competition is JetBlue, who provides free WiFi and seatback entertainment, with plentiful snacks and drinks. For this route, JetBlue and Alaska were the exact same price, and I decided to try Alaska to try something new. Alaska skimped on the drinks, charges a whopping $45 for wifi (except iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook messenger, which can be used free of charge), and offers on-device entertainment through an app, or a tablet for $10. I purchased the fruit and cheese platter for $8.50, which was fine except for the slightly browned apples. I ended up being double charged and am still awaiting my callback regarding my dispute, after four days now. The plane was brand new, just two years old, and the gate staff and flight attendants were particularly kind and helpful.

The plane wasn’t completely full and once we had taken off, the stewardess gave a few passengers the option to switch into other seats to make this flight a little more comfortable. She did it in a well managed way. The stewardess then brought the child in front who was still having problems something to amuse him and a treat. He still wasn’t behaving well for his stressed mother so the stewardess took him for a walk around the plane to give the mom a bit of a break. She brought him back and continued with her work but then she returned again later, knowing the mother was still in a mini crisis. She took the time to sit with this mom and talk with her, understanding the difficulties she was having and giving her the comfort she needed. Both my husband and I were so impressed with her compassion and attentiveness and we are sure she made a huge difference to this mom.

2018-11-12,2,10,"""terrible flight experience""",M Lamirlyev,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Los Angeles. This was the most terrible flight experience ever because of one flight attendant. She was rude, unprofessional, unreasonable and ill-mannered. Her attitude doesn't belong to any job with customer service involved. It started with me not feeling well at the take off, so I had to first use my ""little red bag"" for that purpose & then two more bags of people traveling next to me. As soon as seat belts lights were off, I got up & proceeded to the bathroom to wash myself off. I kindly asked the male attendant, who was there, for extra bags, since I was feeling ashamed to ask people at front or rear rows for their bags. The attendant apologized to me but admitted they were completely out of bags! I went back and had to ask complete strangers in the back of my seat row to borrow their bags. I was then throwing up for another 30 minutes or so in fear that I will use all other bags and run completely out of it. My neighbor then brought me some napkins, so I was very grateful. I also used all water I had left in my bottle. I got up again & went to the bathroom. When I came out the attendant's cart with drinks was literally at my 19th row but they were still servicing people ahead of my row, so if they would move just one row back I would take my seat, but the flight attendant refused when I asked her to allow me to sit. I had to go back to the bathroom area to wait while I was so dehydrated that I could't even stand without leaning up against the wall. The FA passed by me few times taking more drinks (small wine bottles) with her. One time I stopped her asking for a cup of water. She said she can't stop the service because it wasn't her fault that I missed my time in my row. I pointed at the bottle of water standing near her working station, but she said its was her partner's bottle that he was using. It was obvious that the bottle was unopened and full. I explained her that I was feeling really sick, but she pretended not to hear me, and went back to serve others.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Ft Lauderdale to Los Angeles', 'Date Flown': 'October 2018', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 3, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

My husband and I were required to check our carry-ons because we were informed right before entering the plane, that the plane was too small for luggages. We never received luggage tags and were told to go ahead and board, that we could pick up our bags immediately after the flight. This flight was delayed 45 minutes, we arrived in Portland only about 10 minutes before our connecting flight to Detroit was leaving. When we attempted to pick up our carry-on bags from the people unloading on the tarmac, we were told to head to our connecting flight and that our luggages were also going to Detroit. We asked the gentleman unloading to allow us to take our luggages with us, since they were on the cart in front of us but not tagged, however he refused and told us he would be sending them to Detroit and was bringing them down in 4 minutes. Even though it was clear he had no way of knowing which luggages were ours and needed to go to DTW. At the gate before boarding the plane, we again explained the situation to one of the gentleman in charge of the boarding process and that our luggages had been taken from us, however, we never received any luggage tags. He asked us to describe the bags and assured us we would have them once we landed at DTW. Once we landed at DTW we headed to baggage claims, however, our bags never arrived. We proceeded to the Alaskan bag check-in counter, since the Alaska baggage service office was closed and there was no sign indicating when it would open. There was a gentleman who finally assisted us by having us write down our information. However, he said since we did not have official luggage tags no further inquiry could be made. When we insisted we receive some sort of confirmation or claim report to verify record of this incident he assured us his supervisor would meet us at the baggage claim service center to assist us further. We returned to ground level and waited in front of the door for over 20 minutes before returning upstairs to see if she would still be coming to meet us. We spoke with the same gentleman who helped us earlier he assured us she was on her way. After returning downstairs and waiting for another 15 minutes she came and took an official claim. The entire ordeal lasted for almost 2 hours. Due to the incident our transportation to home was delayed and my husband was unable to make it to work. When I arrived home I spent the majority of my day on hold with Alaska Air. I was on hold for over 2 hours, the operator said I would receive a call back in over 3 hours! When I finally received a call back I was placed on hold again for another 20 minutes, the person I spoke with said our luggages should be leaving Portland only that night and which would arrive at 4 am the next day. When I asked them to confirm they were out luggages, they could not. It was over 24 hours and we did not receive any updates on the status of our lost luggage from DTW service center. Furthermore, I repeatedly tried calling Alaska Air baggage service office with which we made a claim at (DTW) and was unable to speak with a representative, no one picked up.

When the boarding time ""came and went ""with still no plane at the gate, only then did their app update with what I would soon discover was a random new boarding time. After another update, the plane arrived and we all boarded a roasting plane. The captain said there was no APU available at that gate to boost the AC. We were an hour late by now. Nothing was ever mentioned about the lateness so I assume it's normal for them to be late. Then, the plane had a mechanical issue at startup. They apparently have no pull at Denver International, because it took 20 mins for anyone to even arrive at the plane to examine the problem. The prognosis was not good, so they let everyone deplane again. They asked people to ""stay in the area"" although for much of the time there was no Alaska Airlines staff at the gate counter - just a bunch of passengers wondering what was going on. After another 30 mins the flight was canceled. My impression was that this airline, at least in Denver, is amateurish.

Before we took off, the flight was delayed several times. The lack of information from Alaska staff was the worst I have experienced. During the initial two and a half hour delay the only announcement that had been made said ""The flight will be delayed by 80 minutes due to weather, which is good news compared to what I was hearing."" Alaska staff seemed surprised when people came up to the desk with frustration. After boarding three hours late and being requested to buckle seat belts, we were told we'd be off the ground asap, max 30 minutes. The flight took off 80 minutes later with absolutely no further announcement. Once up in the air, my seat did not go back. My screen brightness buttons did not work. My headphone jack did not work. There was no USB charger. And the wifi did not connect for the entire six hour flight. If all this wasn't bad enough, Alaska flight staff then decided to offer double shot free alcohol to a clearly unstable gentleman sitting in the seat closest to the exit row door. This decision put the safety of all passengers on board at risk. After 3-4 large drinks, the gentleman proceeded to shout loudly on at least 10 separate occasions, and continued to act erratically. After another gentleman on the exit row requested to be moved, he was left alone in the exit row to potentially open the emergency door in his inebriated state, or perform action in an emergency situation! My wife was seated directly in front of this now drunk, unstable man and genuinely feared for her safety. Finally the Pilot was summoned to threaten an emergency landing and FBI action.

The woman who assisted me, being that it was my first time traveling with a baby, gave me a large plastic bag and zip ties and said whoever was at the plane helping load, would place my car seat and stroller in the bag that way they would be protected and not dirtied or ruined. When I got off the plane at my destination, the zip ties and plastic bag were in the bottom of my stroller and my stuff had not been covered. Now both my car seat and stroller have dings, dents and scrapes. I am very upset with the fact of this. As I had purchased a brand new combo after being in a car accident with my baby.

There was inclement weather forecasted for NY later that day, so I paid a $25 change fee to fly out on a different flight that departed 2 hours earlier around 10:30 am. However, the storm hit NY earlier and my new flight was delayed over 4 hours and eventually canceled after sitting on the tarmac for an hour. Once we were notified of the cancellation, I called Alaska Airline’s customer service to rebook my flight. There were no direct flights available and there were no flights available to get me home that day. I was offered two options on different airlines: either fly to Seattle that night and take a red-eye to JFK or fly to Los Angeles and take a red-eye to JFK. Neither option would get me to LaGuardia, which was where my car was parked or get me home in time for an important event I had scheduled for Thursday morning. Because of this, the customer service representative offered me a $75 travel credit, reimbursement for the flight change fee that I paid for my canceled flight, and reimbursement for my travel from JFK to my car at LaGuardia. Once I returned home, I called Alaska Airline’s customer service to work out the reimbursements; however, I was told the airline does not provide reimbursements for flights canceled due to weather. While I understand that the airline is not responsible for delays due to weather, it is completely unacceptable for the airline to not fulfill what I was originally promised. Especially after sitting in an airport for over 10 hours, making me pay for a change fee for a flight that was canceled, arriving in a different airport, and booking an inconvenient layover on the opposite side of the country.

Connecting flight from Seattle to Victoria, a short 30 min. flight, total disaster. Flight cancelled due to ""weather"" (so airline assumed no liability and provided no assistance, even for overnight stay in Seattle), when the weather at both the origin airport (SEA) and the destination airport (YYJ) was clear (ceiling at Seattle at least 7,000 feet, visibility at YYJ posted online at that time of day as > 12 miles with one passenger hearing a report from his family at destination that they could see stars in the sky, winds low (< 10mph), no precipitation. Of all of the bogus claims I have ever been subjected to, this one has got to be one of the worst. A Delta flight flew the same route just 20 minutes earlier without delay. The cancellation was announced almost an hour before departure - without even waiting to see whether, in fact, weather remained (or ever was!) an issue. No other cancellations observed on the screens at SEA that night and no other cancellations shown online at YYJ. Apparently, there had been fog at YYJ the two previous nights, so my only guess here is ""pre-emptive cancellation"" (a cancellation because someone thought there *might* be fog again but didn't bother to either check or wait to verify). The next day, there was a wait list for the first flight out. My wife and I had gotten the last 2 tickets on that flight. After Alaska offered $0 for the overnight delay and their phone number for discounted hotel rooms [""at passenger's full expense but we'll at least help you get a discount""] turned out to be worthless (phone number had automated, ""sorry, no rooms available"" message), they NOW offered $400 each for people willing to give up their seats and fly 2-3 hours later. Normally, I'd say ""sure"" if this was a non-work day (I tend to jump at anything above $150/hour) But my wife's wisdom on this question was worth listening too: ""$400 in cash? sure. $400 in airline coupons good on Alaska?

When delayed for a 3rd time, the attendant at the booth stated the next flight will not leave until 2:50pm. We confirmed with attendant to make sure there will be no chance for an earlier flight and he stated ""No, there will be no earlier flight then 2:50pm and to check on Alaska Airline app or website for updates."" It was 10:45am, so we decided to leave airport to grab lunch and come back for 2:50pm flight (we were not the only passengers that left airport). While at lunch my boyfriend checked website and app (which did not work) on his phone, so I checked my phone and it stated 11:30am flight boarding. We decided to call 800# customer service to get clarification. Customer Service Rep stated they show 11:30am flight, we explained our situation and all they said was ""You should have not left the airport"". I called the airport directly to confirm and make sure Alaska Airlines knew what they were talking about, at this point we have lost all faith on anything Alaska Airlines were telling us. The airport called to the gate for us and confirmed they are boarding and will taking off at 12pm. We called back to Alaska Airlines and explained again our situation to another customer service rep. Alaska Airlines rep scheduled us to be on the next flight to SFO at 4:30pm. We asked if they could do anything for us (move us up 1st class, comp drink tickets, etc). No, as delay was not Alaska Airlines fault it was SFO, yet they did not even listen that it was their attendant who gave us false time. We arrive back at the airport by 3:30pm and plane was delayed 2 more times to 5:50pm because crew was stuck in SFO and flying down.

When I called two days ago the agent had offered to fix my trip by routing us from Ogg->LAX->JFK. I called back today (2 days later) to take them up on that offer, and the agent said she would be unable to do that, and that I'd have to buy a whole new ticket. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. First, I paid $3000 for the voucher I used, which was donated by an Alaska executive at a Parkinson's charity auction. I am happy to track down and document all the details of that. Second, It is the airline schedule change that is causing this issue. Third, Alaska Airlines offered me this remedy two days ago, which was not ideal, and are now retracting that offer. Frankly, I'm speechless. This is the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Probably ever. And this is just the return flight. For the outgoing flight, they've change the schedule so that my connection now departs before I arrive.

Service was super friendly and attentive, meals were designed by Seattle chef Tom Douglas (I skipped the entree & dessert, so I can't comment on that) but the salad was very nice, dinner smelled wonderful (pesto), dessert was gorgeous, and the beverages never stopped flowing. I've read reviews that Alaska's first class chairs are uncomfortable due to pitch, I didn't find this to be the case - I found them very comfy, but this was only a 4-5 hour flight.

Both ways were on time, which is generally regarded as mission impossible in the Boston Logan airport - no idea how they manage to pull it. The return flight landed half an hour early which was very much appreciated, considering that it was almost midnight. Alaska guarantees that the bags are delivered to the carousel 20 minutes from the moment the disembarkation starts, both times it was faster than that. Drinks were served 3 times during the 5 and half hour flight. The selection of meals for purchase was generally so so, but no demerit points for that since it's expected of all airlines. They did give a free cookie. Ample space between seats. The wifi was sluggish at times, but the entertainment package was fine. The crew were efficient and polite. But it's the service that made me write the review making sure the airline gets a deserved praise. After the outbound flight, our bag was nowhere to be found. We filed a report while a very patient and nice customer service lady told us what may be happening. She also said that the bag may arrive while we are filing the report as it may have been misdirected elsewhere in the airport. This is exactly what happened. Her apologetic and helpful attitude was already compensating for the inconvenience. However, we were given $50 discount off the next flight. On the flight back, something started dripping on me from above. It turned out some kind of saline solution from another passenger's bag (makes me happy that they prohibit carrying acids and dangerous chemicals!). The crew rushed with napkins, cleaned everything up, made sure the dripping stopped within minutes, and we got all the alcohol and the food for free. This is how the airline service is meant to be.

2017-02-13,3,10,"""Alaska is my third choice""",R Matthews,"✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines has gotten better over the years but still has a ways to go. Many of their flights are still late and they generally do an awful job of updating the electronic screens at the gates. The screen will say a flight is boarding in 5 minutes when there isn't even a plane at the gate. It's also comical how Alaska charges most of their passengers to check a bag but then offers to do it for free as nearly every flight has issues with overhead bin space. So if you're flying Alaska check in online and choose zero bags to check. A screen or two later Alaska will usually offer to let you check your carry-on for free. And even if they don't, they almost certainly will offer to do so at the gate. Why not offer a free checked bag to everyone if you're going to offer that anyway? It's not fair to those who paid to check their bags. On the plus side their newest planes (the ""next gen"" 737-800 and -900) have more generous legroom and power at your seat. On the downside you have to use your own device for inflight entertainment. Alaska could learn something from Virgin American (which they now own). They do offer free (for now) streaming shows over WiFi but it's cumbersome, buggy, and you have to click past several screens trying to sell you GoGo inflight WiFi. While they offer a decent selection of paid food and beverages they have only a single food and beverage cart for the entire plane and a 737-900 is a long plane. So it takes something like 45 minutes for the service to work its way from the front to the back. But my biggest complaint about Alaska is they have many flights that are chronically late, yet they refuse to change the scheduled times. Even the flight crews have no explanation why they don't change the scheduled times. Southwest flies many of the same routes and puts Alaska to shame with their on-time record on those flights. And if anything goes wrong, like bad weather (we recently had snow in Seattle, for example) look out as Alaska turns into total chaos - especially at SeaTac. Wait times exceed one hour for calling them, lines stretch way down the hall from their customer service counters, their website falls on its face from the load, etc. And if you do stand in line for hours trying to rebook your cancelled, or infinitely delayed, flight, you're usually offered nothing useful and a joke of a customer care package. Basically they just seem not to care as they already have your money. Alaska charges at least $125 to make any changes to most flights and it's often horrifically expensive if you have to make a last minute change. This is in stark contrast to Southwest that charges no penalties for changes. Alaska's boarding is annoying with several ""tiers"" of preboarding which often amounts to at least a third of the plane with many of those people still blocking the aisles once they start general boarding. Again, Southwest is a far more pleasant and efficient experience. But airlines like United are even worse in this regard. Overall, for west coast travel I often have my pick of Southwest, Virgin America, Alaska, Delta, and United. And I try to book flights in that order of priority. Alaska is my third choice after Southwest and Virgin.",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 737-900', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Seattle to Los Angeles', 'Date Flown': 'February 2017', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Food & Beverages': 3, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 2, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Upon calling for my refund because there were open seats, the customer care agent was extremely rude, said they would refund it only this once and never do that again.

The night before there was some snow but by the time we were going to leave it was clear. So like a typical there needs to be clearing of the runways, de-icing of the planes, etc., but it appeared that not only did they not take care of this prior to us boarding, but as we were boarding they still told us that we were leaving on time. Even after sitting on the plane 25 minutes after we were supposed to leave, we were finally told we were going to have to pull out on the side of the runway and wait another 40 minutes to de-ice and wait for the plane's oil to warm up. I understand that all these things need to happen and sometimes there's issues, it's just the poor preparation and the lack of communication that makes this service dissatisfying.

Last night we experience turbulence on the flight and the captain announced to us more than once that it was going to be intermittent throughout the flight and why, jet stream winds that we were going through and not to worry as it would not get worse than what we were experiencing. He was very reassuring and kind. Also, when do you have the cockpit crew stand with the flight attendants as you are leaving the cabin to greet passengers? Extremely impressed! The absolute only negative is that the planes are a little old and the seats are not that comfortable, but each seat has an electrical plug and there is wifi on the airplane.

I got to my 8:30 AM flight and had the pleasure of sitting next to a fine Alaska attendant who was heading back to the Greatland. As I was departing the aircraft in ANC she noticed my wallet which had departed my pocket somehow and got it back to me. My only issue was at baggage claim. I watched the clock countdown and my bag got there in 21 minutes. As this was not the 20 minutes they strive for I grabbed my bag and went to get my 2500 miles added to my account. The young lady working there said they had made it as they did not go by the time which was at the claim area they go by another clock apparently which us passengers are not aware of. The lady in front of me was not pleased and neither was I. I told her as a Gold member this was the first time I had run into this issue and it sort of sounded like false advertising.

(Even when they say you have your own). There is no difference in extra leg room between 1st and economy plus. Just 2 seats a row instead of 3, which is nice, but not for the price difference. Service onboard is not first class quality when compared to Delta, Virgin, Air New Zealand (to name a few). Not even close. Food, drinks, services just not that special. Alaska sells off vacant 1st class seats at the last moment if they're available for $50. This is painful. Great for the person who gets a $1000 seat for $50 - not good when you pay a premium for peace and quiet. But, it explains why they don't care about good service in 1st. Alaska needs to step it up.

2016-07-19,6,10,"""decent crew and good value""",I Chandramouli,"AS 3380, Portland - San Jose, operated by Skywest. Check in at PDX was extremely smooth and efficient, so we had an hour to spare before boarding. Boarding was out of the cramped concourse A and began 10 minutes late with no explanation. Once aboard, the E175 was in good condition and was extremely spacious, even more so than the 737 on the outbound flight, although the overhead bins were small. A weight balance issue resulted in several passengers in the last few rows having to move forward, this took a while as FA's had to recruit volunteers and people were stubborn. Fortunately, we still managed to push back within 15 minutes of scheduled departure and were airborne after a short taxi. Cabin crew were nice, but they could have managed the timing of the short flight better. They spent the first half of the flight chatting in the galley. A small snack with the beverage was a nice touch, but it didn't start until halfway through the flight. Literally right after they finished the beverage service, a flight attendant came through with a trash bag when most people were not even finished, so most had to sit with trash on their traytables while the FA's resumed chatting in the galley. They had more than enough time to get the service done as the FA's on the outbound leg easily served an aircraft twice the size and we still had 20 minutes after the service during cruise. Finally, during final approach, they realized we needed them to collect the rubbish and did so. We landed in San Jose 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and they made sure to brag about Alaska's on-time performance flightstats award. Overall, AS will get you from Point A to B reliably with decent crew and good value, but they shouldn't sell themselves as a major legacy airline when they are really just a decent budget airline. While AS is certainly not bad, I usually try to book with Jetblue or Virgin America due to their combination of a low fare with great service.

As a result, we pushed back about 15 minutes late. The gate agent acted as though we were a bother to her - a real attitude issue. The four FA's working the flight were more interested in chatting with each other and constantly checking their iPhones, than interacting with passengers. This was particularly true later in the flight when the FA's gathered in the forward galley for a chat-fest. Our seating area was filthy, with coffee stains and food crumbs on the tray tables and the area between the seats The IFE on Alaska is woefully inadequate; in 1st, you are offered a DigEPlayer (like a small tablet) preloaded with content. Your other choice is to stream content on your own device, but to do so, you must pay for it. This is inferior to the AVOD on American and Delta that is complimentary in 1st.

Departing on Monday, we flew to Portland on a daylight flight. The crew, plane and service was just fine all the way around. Landing at PDX we noticed how much rain the area had been receiving - what a mess. The airport was fine. We were there about an hour before we departed to the land of Lost Wages. The pilot informed us that the climb out may be a bit on the bumpy side and we had to stay at a lower altitude the entire way due to upper level turbulence. It was not bad at all. On our return, our departure flight was to be a bit on the bumpy side but we had been warned of this. Just prior to departing the pilot came out and talked to us about his 26 years of experience with Alaska and how much he, his co-pilot and crew appreciated our flying with them. I have seen this a couple of other times and I was impressed. The flight to SEA was great. Our departing Seattle was expected to be rough and we were informed that we would climb out at a lower altitude for some distance due to expected rough air, not bad though. We were on a new 737-900 which had been in service for about six weeks, still had the new plane smell. Everything worked great - the service, the food, our luggage arriving with us was a bonus as I was fairly certain it might not.

I'm tall and I would expect 1st class to provide extra leg room. Not on Alaska Airlines. My knees were crushed for a good part of the flight. Food, other than soft drinks all other beverages cost. Nothing was complimentary. The meal was a TexMex Salad that was mostly a pile of lettuce with cheese on top. A prepackaged cookie was thrown in. Coach had options better than First class. Upon asking for some fruit from coach I was told ""we'll see"" and it was going to cost me extra. Coffee was never offered and upon asking I was told maybe they had some in coach but they were out. Little to no complimentary inflight entertainment. That was going to cost too. As soon as we were over Mexican airspace the whole system went dead. No wifi. Not even when flying in American airspace. If it was offered, as apparently it was on some flights, it was going to cost. After meal service, I couldn't get a even a small bag of pretzels. No effort was made to make the flight more comfortable or to provide any alternative food. The crew was friendly enough but seemed inexperienced in providing any first class service. Oddly the flight began with an announcement from the pilot (male) on how attractive the all female flight crew was. I felt as if I had stepped back 50 years. Though minor, it wasn't appropriate or professional. My expectations for first class aren't all that high. A comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, complimentary beverages (inc wine), somewhat of a more substantial meal than you would receive in coach and at the very least a flight crew that tried to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Alaska Airlines provided non of these. No blanket or pillow, nothing to read - having to beg for coffee? And above all else I conveyed this info to Alaska Corporate/Customer Care. Nothing from them with even a hint they might want to retain a customer. If you are going to spend the extra money to arrive refreshed via flying first class, heed my advice, find another airline.

Although it was raining upon our arrival, there were numerous television crews both outside and inside to catch shots of the plane, crew and passengers. The RDU folks that greeted us, (about 75 or so) lined up, gave each of us a welcome to Raleigh bag of goodies plus clapped and cheered for us. I was amazed at the welcome - Southern Hospitality at its best! The only downside was that our luggage did not get to the passengers within the 20 minute guarantee. We each received the 2500 mile ticket to apply to our Mileage Plan - it's all good. The flight there was great by the way - 4 hours and 26 minutes with very little to gripe about.

All the while the staff member was entertaining and patient with my curious and slightly anxious daughter and assured me that he will take care that my husband gets on the plane in time as he was late returning the rental car, which he did. Everyone else working with Alaska Air was very courteous and attentive as well. Since we booked our seats late, we were not assigned to the same row, and with two small children this six hour flight could have turned very ugly if we were kept apart. The flight attendants took care of this issue right away and adjusted our seating so that we were in the same row (also thanks to two gracious gentlemen who agreed to switch their seats for us). The flight was long but comfortable, there was enough leg room even in the economy seats with snacks, drinks, and entertainment tablets making the long flight with tired kids tolerable. By the way the food was hot and delicious. Another nice touch came when we requested an entertainment tablet which was ten dollars per piece. The flight attendant noticed that my husband gave it to our daughter right away, so she gave him another one at no extra charge. No one harassed us when our kids were getting loud and impatient (which happened couple of times and ended very quickly, they are such good kids), and no one mentioned anything to me as I was nursing my little boy for most of the flight. I only have great things to say about the Alaska crew, they were so professional and compassionate.

2015-09-17,1,10,"""don't really care about you attitude""",Susan Sopp,"There have been numerous incidents with Alaska Airlines while my daughter has lived in Mammoth Lakes over the past 5 years. Today, Sept 15, 2015 my daughter, who had made her reservation weeks ago to fly down and go on vacation to a central coast beach town, got a text at 1 pm today notifying her that her flight had been cancelled. The next flight is tomorrow evening which would have her arriving at 7ish and we are due to be at our vacation destination tomorrow. If she took the offer for tomorrow we would be losing one nights hotel stay nonrefundable as there is a 48 hour deadline to cancel. She called Alaska Airlines to get her refund as now she has to drive down to LA by herself in order to make our plan work. She asked why the flight was cancelled, already knowing what they would say. Alaska Airlines go to phrase for cancelling flights is ""mechanical problems"" when the flight isn't full enough. Sure enough that is what she was told. I'm thinking really, there are 3 hours before the flight leaves LAX for Mammoth and there isn't a working plane available to be brought in? Well, of course there is nothing a passenger can do or say to change the ""I don't really care about you"" attitude that exists in this situation. It is really sad that this happens fairly often which proves to me that Alaska Airlines really doesn't care about this particular flight. I feel Alaska Airlines should perhaps not be flying in to Mammoth Lakes every day. If people knew there was a limited schedule at least they would know how to plan instead of last minute cancellations being frequent.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Mammoth Lakes to LAX', 'Date Flown': 'September 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The trip from Atlanta to Seattle was delayed due to a mechanical issue, starboard engine. This was fixed and we were about two hours late departing ATL. We were rebooked in ATL prior to finally leaving. This delay caused me to miss Flight 119 from SEA to ANC. I was rebooked on Flight 121 which is a Combi 400 737. Arrived at almost 3am and my luggage did not. None of the Atlanta folks luggage made it to ANC. I spoke with the luggage person and she said it would be sent out later on in the morning. I accepted this, not happy but it does happen. I called the MVP Gold customer service folks today to inquire about a partial refund for my flight as it had no 1st Class. She spoke to the accounting department and said I will get an $80 credit. The bottom line here is a customer who was not pleased overall, especially in regards to finding out about travel segments, some being refundable and some not. Oh well, live and learn.

Surprisingly, two Alaska Airlines employees came out and helped us with our luggage tags since they use a special holder to attach to the luggage. As we were about to start boarding another employee approached us and asked if we would like to board using a new system that they were starting to use.

To top it off I was worried about my 70 year old mom (she was upset and crying) so I asked the flight attendant about my mom and dad not being on the plane. She snapped at me that it was too bad, and that they probably weren't there on time. I responded that we checked into the airport 2 hours previously. She said rudely, 'so?'.

However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can. We once showed up 20 minutes before our departure time with boarding passes I had printed the night before and the plane had left already!
