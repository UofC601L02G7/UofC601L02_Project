2024-08-06,1,10,"""disappointing and outrageous""",Bohae Lim,"Not Verified |  On August 4, 2024, I was scheduled to return home to Virginia from Austin, Texas, on Allegiant Air flight 1516. Since it was a 2:34 PM flight, I arrived at the airport with my two daughters and my 78-year-old mother two hours early to check in and wait. Starting around 1:40 PM, boarding was repeatedly delayed due to various issues, and eventually, we were informed that the plane needed to fly to Houston for refueling. (Delays due to refueling are a very frequent occurrence with this airline!) Since my children had their school orientation the next day, it was crucial for us to get home. Despite several delay announcements, we waited at the airport for over 7 hours before being told that the flight was canceled due to weather. The weather in Austin at the time of departure was clear, and there were no issues at the destination. We were told it was due to Tropical Storm Debbie, but I learned that if the flight had departed on time, it would have been unaffected. The airline’s response was disappointing and outrageous. The ground staff shirked responsibility, directing us to call the service center to reschedule or request a refund, offering only a flight on Thursday or a refund. After 7 hours of waiting and growing frustration, I protested but was threatened with being removed from the airport by security, seemingly because of my Asian descent. We were eventually forced to leave the airport and had to contact relatives in Austin to pick us up. Desperate to get home, I persisted in contacting the service center. After three lengthy calls and an hour-and-a-half wait, I finally spoke with a representative who offered the same irresponsible options I had faced at the airport: “The earliest flight is on Sunday, or we can offer a full refund.” Are you saying the next available flight is on Sunday, August 11th? What about the additional lodging and travel expenses? Am I expected to cancel a flight I booked months in advance at a low price and find a last-minute, expensive one-way ticket? This is unreasonable. I demanded the quickest option to get close to home and refused to hang up. As a result, I was offered a flight to Pittsburgh at 6:30 AM the next day. I accepted and rented a car to drive approximately 190 miles home. Due to the airline’s refusal to take responsibility, I endured two days of delays and confusion at the airport and incurred additional costs, including $500 for the rental car.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Austin to Washington', 'Date Flown': 'August 2024', 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

My flight 1233 from Minot International (MOT) to Orlando Sanford International (SFB), scheduled to depart on Monday, 05 August 2024 at 5:43 PM, was delayed to 12:30 PM on Tuesday, 06 August 2024. This last-minute rescheduling caused me significant financial loss and inconvenience. As a self-employed professional, I rely on timely travel to manage my business commitments. The delay resulted in a full day’s lost earnings and additional expenses for accommodation, meals, and transportation. Despite their claims of prioritizing passenger safety, Allegiant Air showed no regard for the financial and personal impact their delays cause. To make matters worse, when I reached out to Allegiant for compensation, their response was dismissive and inadequate. This level of customer neglect and mismanagement is unacceptable, and I feel cheated by their false promises.

2024-06-15,1,10,"""first complaint I've ever had""",E Doyle,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid in advance for a window seat, but it was going to be on the side of the plane in the sun. I wanted to sit on the shaded side so I went into the app and changed it about 2 1/2 hours before my flight. I changed to the very last row on the opposite side. I also paid for priority boarding so I could board quicker, and once I got back to my seat I noticed there was no window at all. There were 2 flight attendants in the back and I told them I wanted a window seat and asked if they could keep me posted as to whether one came available. I was originally going to be in seat 30A and changed to 32F. The seating chart showed one person in that row in the middle seat. All 3 of the seats in row 30 were empty until one young man came and sat in the original window seat I had until 2 1/2 hours earlier (30A). I would have been happy with any window seat at that time and I knew he was sitting in the wrong seat because he saw there was no one in the window so he moved over. I asked one of the flight attendants if she could just check with him to see if he was in the right seat. She said very rudely, that if they could accommodate they would, but she wasn't going to check everyone's tickets to be sure they were in the right seat. I told her that's not what I said or what I was asking. I told her I'm a bit claustrophobic and really wanted a window. She asked if someone had sat in my original seat, or how it was that I managed to get the one I was in. I tried to explain all of the above to her, but she just repeated she wasn't going to check everyone's ticket and they would let me know if there was another window available. I was just going to stay where I was at, but the other attendant found an empty window for me. I just got moved and then we had to de-plane for some issue, but that's unrelated. So, yes, I changed seats at the last minute. No, I didn't know there was no window in the very back. I simply asked if she could verify the seat if the gentleman in 30A, to be sure that's his correct seat. She said that if it wasn't, the person assigned to that seat would come and he'd have to move anyways. I have flown Allegiant for years and I've been their biggest advocate. Anytime someone turns to up their nose when I mention flying Allegiant, I have always said that I've never had any problems. This is the first complaint I've ever had. I've worked in customer service my entire life, and I know what good customer service is and this isn't it. This may sound very trivial, but it means something to me. I don't need this sarcasm when I've paid money to fly this airline. Asking to verify one person's seat is not asking too much.

The staff is always kind and helpful. That’s about the best I can say about Allegiant. The planes are so crowded due to the cheap fares that you are shoe horned into the seats. If you are sitting next to an average size American you probably won’t rest at all due to bumping into your fellow passengers in the adjacent seats. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, and leg room is minimal at best. There is no in flight entertainment other than people watching and the sounds of unhappy young children crying or screaming. My flight today was delayed. I was notified of the delay via email and text 2:15 hours beforehand, just as I arrived at the airport and had checked in my rental car. I had my family of 5 in tow and we ended up having to Uber back to our hotel who graciously allowed us to have our room back until 7 hours later when we had to head back to the airport.

2024-05-31,3,10,"“claim to be pet friendly, but it was not”",V Allen,"Not Verified | Allegiant is very popular in my town as the only airline at our small airport. Direct flights into other small airports. It is well known that it's a no frills type of service. I have flown with them prior, and had no issues. But this time I traveled due to an ailing friend who died during my visit. I decided last minute that I couldn't let her cat go to a shelter. So we put her in an approved carrier and I paid to bring her home. She's a quiet gentle kitty, but was meowing as we boarded the loud plane. Though I hardly knew the cat, she had been quiet, only making noise when being moved around. So when the stewardess came to me and threatened to have me kicked off the plane if I didn't get her quieted immediately, I was shocked and dismayed. Already distraught over losing a friend, and now wondering and hoping I can make new kitty's presence work in my home, I sure didn't need someone making impossible demands. I had never flown with an animal like that. Some, more sympathetic passengers, offered advice of tranquilizers, etc. But I was in the pickle NOW. I really didn't want to miss this flight! They moved the passenger in front of me. But kitty quieted once we took off and hardly made a peep the rest of the flight. I was in tears off and on during the 2 hour flight, realizing this cat was all I had left of my friend. It made it difficult to communicate with passengers, or the crew. I realize that's a personal problem, but a real part of my experience, here. It is the next day, and I still feel traumatized by the whole ordeal. I wish they were more specific about pet travel in their policy explanation. I really had no clue that a generally quiet, but a temporarily meowing cat was reason to be removed from a plane! I have traveled with children and babies screaming, but never heard anyone suggest drugs to shut them up, and never a threat to kick them off! I will likely use Allegiant again because of the convenience. But I just want to forewarn others who might be considering taking a pet.

2024-05-05,1,10,"""an absolute nightmare""",Adrian Martinez,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying with Allegiant Airlines, and it was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment we arrived at the airport, it was clear that this was going to be a disastrous journey. Despite arriving more than two hours early for our flight, there were no staff members at the ticketing counter, and the line was outrageously long, stretching out the door. In a panic, we tried calling Allegiant's customer care line for assistance, only to be met with rude and hostile customer service representatives who seemed more interested in blaming us for the situation rather than helping. It was abundantly clear that the fault lay squarely with the airline for not having enough staff to handle the volume of passengers. After what felt like an eternity of waiting, we were finally able to speak with a supervisor, who was perhaps the most rude and dismissive person we encountered throughout this ordeal. Despite our pleas for assistance, he callously informed us that the next available flight wouldn't be for another five days, leaving us stranded at the airport with our 5-month-old baby and all of our belongings, including our car seat and stroller, which were already on the plane. To add insult to injury, Allegiant initially claimed that they had loaner car seats and strollers available to help alleviate our situation. However, when we asked for them, suddenly they had nothing of the sort, leaving us completely helpless and at their mercy. In summary, our experience with Allegiant Airlines was an absolute nightmare. From the lack of staff at the ticketing counter to the abysmal customer service and the complete disregard for our well-being as passengers, it was by far the worst travel experience we have ever endured.

When I came up to the counter, probably to read the signs, A lady asked me if I was flying Allegiant, and where I was going. I told her that I was going to Jacksonville, and she said she was going there too. She said that she was from Afghanistan, and her English wasn't the best. She asked me if I would help her. I was happy to help since we were going to the same place, even though my plan was to hang out at the USO eating chips and drinking soda as I am a veteran's spouse. We both sat down until the counter reps came out and the line began to form. I checked in online before getting to the airport, so I checked my bag first. Then I stepped over to help the passenger from Afghanistan. While we were in line, I asked her if she had her boarding pass, and she only showed me her reservation, and I saw that she hadn't checked in yet. So, I tried to walk her through the steps to checkin online on her phone like I did. This took a while because I tried to explain step by step, and there were a lot of steps involved to check in. The check-in was interrupted when it was my turn at the counter. So we had to start over. The check-in was interrupted again when she got a phone call. So we had to start over again. It was very important for her to check in online to avoid the $75 charge for the 2nd bag she wanted to check. She preferred to pay the lower charge, $30, offered online. I tried explaining this to the Allegiant counter reps hoping that they would somehow make an exception, save her the trouble, and just let her pay the $30 at the counter. Instead of making an exception, they began questioning me and asking the passenger from Afghanistan about me. She told them several times that I was there to help. The counter reps were rude to me and overreaching. They reported me to security! The reps lied, reporting to security that I wouldn't allow her to talk to them. The passenger I helped spoke to the counter reps the whole time. I was just standing there to help and repeatedly trying to walk her through the check-in process on her phone. One of the reps tried to force me to render my boarding pass and ID unnecessarily. The passenger I helped explained several times that I was helping her. She apologized to me, the security officer who questioned me also apologized to me, however, the counter reps continued their weird behavior, taking pictures of me, and writing notes about me when I boarded the plane. It was unbelievable! I asked the passenger a couple of times if she still needed my help, and she said yes, so I stayed, since I said I would help. I was relieved when the counter reps finally checked her bags even though they did so by taking her phone and forcing her to download the app and on top of that also forced her to pay $5 for the boarding pass... I would think that she could access the boarding pass through the app. Anyways, I felt very uncomfortable and undervalued as a customer. I felt falsely accused of something I didn't do. It's still hard to believe, and it hurts a bit to be treated like a criminal when you're only trying to help someone.

2024-03-24,1,10,"""most rude and incompetent airline""",C Bayne,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is without a doubt the most rude and incompetent airline in existence. I have flown many different airlines across the years, including cheap airlines like Spirit, and Allegiant simply is not worth the money — no matter how cheap the flight, it is severely over-priced because this airline is garbage. On this occasion, I had to change my flight so I could leave a day earlier and I waited hours upon hours for someone to answer my call. Then this incompetent man, at some call center ex-US, disconnects me. I have to repeat the entire process, more hours spent waiting for someone to answer. I was on the phone all day, literally. So I finally get my flight changed and the incompetent man charges me to change the flight, despite that I had paid extra to be able to change my flight. So the man issues a credit to me for a future flight instead of a refund.  Fast forward to my flight day and I am getting notices about my original flight, not the flight that I am headed to the airport for. So I go into the Allegiant app to see what is going on and even though I have a boarding pass for the new flight I am still booked on the old flight. Obviously a 9-year old can see the problem in this, but the incompetent Allegiant customer service rep cannot. So I attempt to cancel the the incorrect flight and I get a pop-up. It tells me it is too late to make changes and to call a special “back door” phone number. Here it is for you: 702-637-7038. My call is answered right away but by this time I am in my car headed to the airport. The agent, who is in the US, tells me that I am not actually on the flight that I am headed to the airport to board! I did mention that I have a boarding pass, right? Tell me how that happened! So she straightens everything out for me. She also tells me that the voucher the incompetent man emailed to me is unusable. So she sends a credit voucher that looks completely different.  Now since I had a credit on Allegiant, I had to dreadfully fly with them one more time. But never will I ever fly with this lousy airline again. So this time around, everyone that I communicate at Allegiant via phone or email regarding my request for accommodation as a disabled person for seat assignment and medical equipment is extremely rude. And as a disabled person they gave me an extremely hard time about accommodating my medical needs. I had to threaten them three times with going to the authorities — they attempted to lie to me and tell me that they are complying with all applicable laws. I told them that I know my rights and I would not let them get away with violating them. Finally they acquiesced but to be insolent they assigned me a seat in the last row of the plane and it was all very unacceptable. I had previously told them many times over that I need a far forward aisle seat to accommodate my medical needs. They refused! Their website even states that they will assign the seat to accommodate a disability! I have flown a lot and used many different airlines. My request for accommodation as a disabled person has always been met with prompt polite service. Until I traveled on Allegiant.

Your information has already been sent to our Paynuver team and this will be reissued as soon as we can. We truly appreciate your patience."" If this process is this difficult when a problem crops up, why would Allegiant continue using the same process?

2023-11-05,3,10,"""They should be ashamed""",Amanda Wright,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I have flown so many times with Allegiant Air, recently I flew with them for my girls trip to NC. They should be ashamed of how they “handle” their consistent, returning, paying customers. I boarded my flight, row 4, and as usual, no overhead space for my carry on luggage. The flight attendants offered no assistance in trying to find space in the overhead compartments, and said, “you just have to look”. They also do not police patrons who board first, sitting further back, who just wanna throw their luggage up in front by so they can just grab it and go once we’ve reached our destination. I flew with 2 friends who managed to find spots, I however did not, so my luggage was taken by a flight attendant, who said it would be complementary checked, and was then taken off the plane. When we arrived at our destination, I went to the baggage claim, and when I saw my luggage, I couldn’t believe my eyes! The handle on my luggage literally was snapped clean off. No note, no one to meet me to explain its condition, just my bag circling the carousel with the broken off handle laying on top of my luggage. Went to customer service, directed to the Allegiant counter, filled out the claim form and was told that a representative would be contacting me. Received an email requesting pictures, the cost of my luggage, my mailing address and phone number, which gave me hope that perhaps compensation would be made. I am sharing my experience along with pictures of the condition of my luggage before I boarded the plane and then when I claimed it at the airport. I followed the instructions I was given. Not to mention I paid a carry-on charge of $30 which I feel I should be refunded since they took my luggage off the plane. Following is an email I received from Allegiant. Allegiant Air takes no responsibility for or accepts any liability for damage to my luggage and basically blamed me for having what they say is luggage with wear and tear not sustainable to the various handlings of luggage. My luggage is not very old and in perfect condition. So I guess this means they feel it was susceptible to damage. Just wanted to warn fellow travelers of this unfortunate experience and hope no one requires customer service with Allegiant Airlines because it is awful.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Orlando-Sanford to Asheville', 'Date Flown': 'October 2023', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2023-10-03,1,10,"""worst customer service experience2",D Paul,"Not Verified |  So it became clear that I was not going to be able to make my Allegiant flight. Three weeks before the flight I called the airline. I prefer speaking directly to a human and was hoping that I could get through to someone, or that there would be a call back option. I was a bit surprised that there was no toll free number. I suppose I'd be happier to wait on hold if I knew it wasn't costing me money and if I had some rough idea about how long the wait would be. Anyway after 15 minutes on hold (and knowing that the meter was running) I decided to try a different approach. I sent an email with all my information and asked that someone from the airline please contact me at their earliest convenience. I assumed I would hear from someone. Two weeks later after not hearing anything I reached out via the chat option on your website. I explained my situation and my previous attempts to contact the airline and hoped that my situation would be successfully resolved. The agent who was handling my file could not have been less helpful. Turns out the flight was seven days from the chat day so she said that according to the terms of the deal she was not obligated to refund or credit any portion of the flight. She seemed to really enjoy sharing that part. When I tried to highlight the fact that I had unsuccessfully reached out on precious occasions and that I thought that should be taken into consideration she responded rudely and was extremely condescending. When I asked to speak with her supervisor she ended the chat. I tried to get back in touch expecting that you had other agents working there but I got her. When I insisted that my concerns were not adequately dealt with, and when I again asked to speak to either her boss or another agent, she refused and ended the chat. This is honestly the first negative review I have ever posted. I found this to literally be the worst customer service experience I have ever been a part of.  I do understand that you're a discount airline, and that probably means that you can't allocate unlimited resources to your customer service department, but you should really try to hire people who genuinely care about your customers and also care about the reputation and image of your airline. The person I dealt with today very clearly cares about neither.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Fargo to Phoenix', 'Date Flown': 'October 2023', 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The state of Tennessee allows this so I brought one with me for our trip and have done this many times. In Albany Airport the drill is bring the locked case to the counter of the airline you are flying, whoever is working the counter calls TSA, TSA agent arrives, I open the locked case and then the TSA agent calls one of the Albany County sheriff’s and both look at my drivers license and my pistol license a I fill out a TSA card and sign it, the signed card goes in the case and I lock it, receive a baggage claim ticket and the locked case goes with all bags. On Friday we arrive at the Nashville airport and go to the Allegiant counter where we checked our bags and I tell the folks at the counter that I’m checking my firearm. All 4 had a deer in the headlights look. Now mind you this is Tennessee, not Connecticut or Massachusetts or New York. None of them knew what to do. So, I told them that they needed to call a TSA agent. My wife and I waited for 10 minutes and another Allegiant employee arrives, he fills out some paperwork and has me sign it and then tells me to take the paperwork and my firearm thru TSA security and give it to one of the people at our gate I looked at my wife and looked back at him and said “Are you sure about this, I have never done this before.” He said “Yes.” So off we go to TSA security with locked firearm case in hand. When we get to TSA security I explain to the TSA agent what just took place and he looks at me wide eyed and says “That’s disconcerting.” I then hear people yelling and turn to see 2 of the people who were working the counter and they said “sorry you need to come back to the counter and check your pistol.” Now the Allegiant employee has me open the case looks at the handgun puts paperwork inside and I lock the case and he takes it. My wife says “Are you going to give us a baggage claim ticket?” He replies “No, I’m going to put it with your bags.” My wife “Are you sure?” He says “Yes.” We arrived in Albany and no pistol.  I spoke to an Allegiant employee who said “Nashville is the worst Allegiant station in the country.” Of course my stomach is in knots because I’m worried that my handgun could be in the hands of a criminal. As I’m filling out paperwork my wife asks this gent “Should we file a police report?” He says “I would, these people need to learn a lesson and someone should be fired.” My wife locates 2 Albany County Sheriff deputies who come to the counter and I tell them the same story and both of them look at me in disbelief. The one sheriff walks away saying “let me make some phone calls.” Thank God for these 2 sheriffs. My pistol is in the hands of the Nashville PD, Thank the Lord. So tomorrow I have to call Nashville PD and speak to someone in charge of the evidence locker and have them ship it to an FFL.

Every single person I asked said to Google it and call Allegiant. I tried but “due to the cancellation of your flight, we are experiencing high call volumes.” Couldn’t get through. Now we are panicking about where our luggage is. Once again not one person could tell us where it was. Finally, after my daughter and I ran to the baggage claim, I found a gentlemen who worked for the airport that pointed us in the right direction. My husband went to the Allegiant desk where you check in. They told him they didn’t know anything about the flight either but that everyone would get vouchers and $150. What about the money we spent on the vacation we were going to? All communication was via text! Shame on you Allegiant! My family has loved flying with this airline.

2023-06-19,1,10,"""So disappointing and astounding""",Kerry Housley,"Not Verified |  I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think it’s necessary to document the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that I’ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldn’t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didn’t believe my family because the agent didn’t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience I’ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldn’t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me!* I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I don’t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply. I could not get this person's name or employee information and am not sure how to follow up on such an extreme situation, so I’m writing a review online in hopes of steering others away from such a challenging circumstance and genuinely negative interaction with another human being. Our world has enough trouble and challenges these days; there should be no reason to experience interactions like this one, especially in a professional setting.

We received an update flight was being delayed reason given was that there was air traffic controller issue at LAS. FAA site confirmed that a runway had to be closed etc. The problem here is a few mins after the announcement I saw the pilot walk off the plane with all his belongings. But the gate agents continued to update as flight is delayed. Hours later the airline gave an update calling it an extended delay and the flight will not leave until May 13. I thought it was odd that the pilot who left never returned. Because the pilot got tired of waiting he decided not to fly at all. The crew from May 13 advised us of that. So we missed a vacation day, lost money on non-refundable tours, etc… all be use Allegiant pilot through a childish temper tantrum for a 3 hour delay. We could have flown and made it to the destination on May 12. Allegiant found a loop hole pertaining to cancellation of flight by calling it an extended delay vs. cancellation. So by doing so they avoid providing refunds for the trip. Not sure about anyone else, but if a scheduled flight does not leave the day it’s supposed to then that is a cancellation in my book. Allegiant ruined a part of my vacation and we only got a voucher that did not even come close at recovering the money we lost because of a single pilot was tired of waiting. I’m astonished that an airline who operates this way is still even around. . This is a low cost airline, and I know that you get what you pay for but there are limits to that even.

Here is the sequence of comical, unbelievable errors by Allegiant, but most disturbing was the nonchalant attitude with no communication and mitigation to the errors. -Flight was late (not usually that big of a deal). After arriving, she waited over two hours for a ""paid"" check baggage, with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby, so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs.  A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew, that Allegiant was short staffed, and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App (even though you have her information, and knew she checked a bag - With no information, and with no-one at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back (we left messages) the communication was completely irresponsible and non-sympathetic to the passenger schedules (like college classes). I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back, paid for transportation there on the next day, Jan 4th, but no one from Allegiant was there (couldn't you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage?)  She found airport staff who said they couldn't help, but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon, but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact, no thanks to Allegiant, so she went in the morning. Why couldn't Allegiant take action to at least communicate? To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful, even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag? Why didn't someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers ""we had an accident, we are short staffed, Allegiant doesn't offer services (or care) so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it, taking a chance on when you arrive because we don't communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive.

Great news with two senior citizens and two kids under the age of 11 and one toddler. After looking at FlightAware I found that this was a rolling delay that had been hours in the making. This notification could have been sent out hours before just like any other airline notifies their customers. So, now we are sitting at a small regional airport for more than two additional hours with small children with an ETA of 1AM. Ideal situation. Upon arrival we were told that our baggage would delivered to carousel 3 but instead it was a delivered to carousel 6 (in another building). This was only after entire A320 worth of passengers with screaming tired children waited for over an hour. Our return trip was no different. We arrived to Sanford to be treated by a departure board showing 22/32 flights delayed. Three gate changes one plane change after boarding, three hours of waiting we board our “new” plane. Just like any terrible infomercial, “but wait there’s more”! After boarding we waited over an hour for them to load the baggage.

Understanding this is the case during the holidays, I kept trying to reach them until I finally reached someone 4 days later by setting my alarm to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. so that I could call them. At this point, I was outside of the 7-day window, but tried to explain to the representative that I'd been trying to reach someone well before the 7-day advance notice requirement for changes.

My bag was smaller than many on the plane. Ended up being fine but she added a lot of stress and irritation to the flight down. Also their bag weight is 10 lbs less than almost every other airline in an effort to squeeze more money out of the passengers who are already flying this airline due to limited funds. On the flight home over thanksgiving weekend we arrived 3 hrs before boarding to reduce stress and ensure no issues getting on the flight. We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told they would not take our bags until 2 hrs prior to check in. All other airlines are 4 hrs. I was uncomfortable with this and asked about the long line at security as well as boarding being so early and doors being closed 10 minutes before departure on way down. She said you can do priority bag check and the lines at security shouldn’t be that bad. So I am currently stuck outside security with no seats, no food or drinks and stressing out as I watch the security line hoping we can rush through in time to catch our flight. We certainly won’t have any time for dinner before our 8 pm flight so maybe it’s another way to make us spend money on the plane?

And now they need to do maintenance on the plane. I'm currently writing this stuck on the plane while they're doing maintenance. Why have everyone board the plane then do maintenance. Absolutely terrible planning. Plane was supposed to be leaving at 6.00pm. It's currently after 8.00pm and we're all still sitting on the plane with no estimated take off time. These seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat in. A concrete park bench is more comfortable. I've flown with other airlines and so far Allegiant Air has the worst seats.

However, how they handled it was terrible for the following reasons: The gate workers were blatantly laughing about the situation in front of us. Extremely unprofessional and unsettling. When I asked questions to the gate workers, they gave sassy answers and were, in my opinion, disrespectful. They were untruthful several times. The most flagrant was when the flight was cancelled at around 10pm they said we would receive an email in the morning about when the flight would leave. We had no idea what time the flight was leaving until we looked it up for ourselves in the app. I woke up at 4am waiting for the email but it never came. 4) They lowered our compensation for no reason. Allegiant was generous and gifted each traveler a certain amount of money for future flights. Then as soon as we left, Allegiant lowered the money we received by $50 and did not provide a reason for why. Ridiculous.

I have the screenshot of it on my phone. I get to the airport at 1:30 and there is a huge line to do the check-in. By the time it's my turn, the girl at the counter wants to charge me $50 for my luggage and $5 for printing my ticket. I explained to her that I tried to print it and pay for my luggage and it told me to come to the counter. She said I needed to do it 1 hour before the flight, I show her the screenshot that I tried to do more than 1 hour before and that is not my fault that by the time I get here you have 50 minutes of waiting in line to get to the counter. She said right now she couldn't do anything. The staff was extremely rude to me and told me that I was wasting her time, that she needed to continue with the next customer, and started calling the next person while I wasn't even checked in. She said if I want to complain, call this phone number, 702 505 8888. She said ""you either leave the luggage here or you pay"". I paid out of desperation to get on that plane. I called that number 4 times, more than 2 hours of waiting time. When I finally can talk with someone, after waiting in line for 90 minutes, the person told me there is nothing they can do once I paid for my luggage at the counter, next time call them and they will add the luggage to my card if I'm having trouble. How do they expect me to communicate with you if you have 2 hours of waiting time during peak hours when my flight is leaving in less than 1? Nothing makes any sense.

How am I supposed to call and ask for help if you have 2 hours of waiting time on the phone line? This is beyond ridiculous.

Email, & all? She said yes. The woman became very rude, & said she had to call customer service to help her, & to step aside so she could help others until she got in touch with them. Mind you this whole time it's making the line stare at us, as she shuffled us from counter to counter. Then she asked for  papers as she has to send a copy to someone. While waiting for the papers she asked her why she had the service dog. What tasks she needs R for. She explained stage 4 breast cancer, she helps me with x,y, and z. She looked at her funny, so she repeated it to her, & it wasn't because she didn't hear her. She legit looked at her, with this look of disbelief, & she repeated as this lady just stared at her.

Oh, & she couldn't do it while she is there when she gets off the plane. I said well if it's only an email she needs to be sent 48hrs in advance, can we have the email that you just used so it will be easier on her? She said no. She had to go to the airport in person 48hrs prior, or R could be denied! I said why can't she have an Allegiant email that works to be sure the paperwork is sent in? I explained that she's literally 1 hour 1 WAY to the airport. I explained that she physically cannot do that (as this was already very clearly insanely overwhelming), especially if all they need is an email. She then says ma'am are you flying today? I said no, I'm her sister, as well as one of her caregivers, & I really want to know why you're making her jump through extra hoops, when you just said it just needs an email. Well she put in the memo/notes of her return flight that's already booked through them that she HAS to come in person 48 hrs in advance, or the dog will be denied. She then said to me, well if you're not flying I've got a whole other line of people to help, & so have a good day.

Got on their website and left them a request to contact me regarding a change in flight schedule. Other than an automated email response never received any communication from allegiant air. We stopped by the ticket counter in Asheville North Carolina and was met by two ticket agents one on both sides of the counter staring into their computers and waited in line was absolutely nobody else in the terminal without being recognized or spoken to. I finally said hi and asked who would can help me please? Neither Agent spoke or motion for me to come forward they just stared at me with literally angry faces. I walked up to the female agent and said hello and related my story of needing to change our schedule flight. The male Angry agent said in a very stern manner we cannot change your itinerary you must call customer service! Related the fact that I've been trying to get through to Customer service many many times by phone and email and had no response so we decided to drive out of our way and hopefully get assistance at the ticket counter. The female agent explained in the most unfriendly manner That she couldn't help me just call Customer service. I replied if I can't get through to customer service can't you help me at all with the change of schedules and the mail customer service agent said once again we can't change your itinerary in an angry manner at which point we exchanged a few final words and he blurted out that they do not work for Allegiant Air they are just contractors working as ticket agents for Allegiant!  Either way they didn't change our schedule and we were out $800 for our flight. We did not choose Allegiant to save money although it was the only convenient way to airline to Melbourne Florida.

For that reason, I needed to cancel my flight and drive up a couple of days early to make it in time for the surgery. I bought the trip protection, and they informed me that my situation did not ""qualify"" for the refund. Never saw a cent of my ""protected"" flight. More recently, we had a flight scheduled but had a last minute COVID-19 exposure (my roommate tested positive for COVID the day of the flight). When I contacted support, they proceeded to tell me to show up for my flight as scheduled and that if I was not positive, they did not care who I had come into contact with (more specifically, that ""we come into contact with asymptomatic covid positive people everyday""). I made the conscious decision to miss the flight (without any form of refund), because I could not knowingly put other people in harms way.

I’ll start by saying if you google Allegiant there’s a reservation.com site that pops up as if they’re affiliated with Allegiant whole time they’re NOT! After trying to book my flight online 5 times my purpose of using google was to get Allegiant Air phone number to book by phone instead. I spoke with an agent who pulled all my info up as if he had access to the Allegiant screen. They repeated back to me the names of all the travelers so I was certain he was apart of Allegiant staff. So everything goes through and they requested that I covered all my numbers besides the last 4 on the card I booked with along with my drivers license. This was my first time booking a flight by phone so it didn’t seem odd because I assumed they just wanted to be sure I was the card holder for the card I was using. So I booked a flight for a total of 5 people and a mini van through Allegiant site but rental was with Enterprise. About a week before my trip I called Enterprise to get a rough estimate on how much the insurance through them would be. Enterprise informed me that they had no reservations with me but did see one that had just recently been cancelled so of course I freaked! Then I remember they agent had given me his personal direct line in case I had any questions or concerns. He goes to tell me I cannot contact Enterprise OR Allegiant whatsoever! He then goes to say that if I were to do so again, the $3,300 for flights and rental would result in a total loss! Mind you when I booked my three older aunts needed wheel chair service! When we got to the airport they saw nothing about wheel chair services! So that annoyed us all! we was also told that it would be no problem that my aunt had her oxygen tank and she could fly with it. The oxygen was confiscated by TSA! The flight was terrible! We were on a 4 hour flight and no snacks or beverages were issued out. This entire time I thought I was saving a ton by doing a bundle deal with flight and rental car only to arrive in Vegas to enterprise and get hit with a $200 fee BEFORE insurance charges! So Allegiant doesn’t tell you about the hidden fees that comes along with you thinking you’re getting a deal! You even have to pay $5 for boarding passes! Could you imagine doing so for flights you have layovers on so that’s an extra $5 on top of there was a couple whose boarding tickets didn’t work SIX times!

The concern has not been addressed, and the only responses I've received are automated emails from customer relations. The purpose of the planned trip was to return to Clearwater, FL, where I was vacationing with my husband and our dog when my father’s health took a severe downturn. I traveled from PIE to LEX on Allegiant flight G4 1917 on Jan 30, 2002, leaving our dog behind with my husband. My father passed away a day after I arrived in Lexington, and my husband traveled from Clearwater, FL to Lexington, KY on Allegiant flight G4 1917 on Feb 10, 2022, along with our dog, to join family during a very difficult time. My husband returned to Clearwater on Allegiant on Feb 17, 2022. I was not allowed to board my return flight to Clearwater on Feb 20, 2022 with our dog because the pet carrier did not meet Allegiant size specifications. However, our dog had traveled from PIE to LEX with my husband in the very same pet carrier on Feb 10, 2022. Also, I purchased the pet carrier based on the fact that it was identical to a pet carrier that was on my Allegiant flight from PIE to LEX on Jan 30, 2022. The passenger with the in-cabin pet on my Jan 30, 2022 flight told me that she had flown from LEX to PIE using the same pet carrier. Allegient allowed my dog to travel one way with my husband but did not allow her to make the return trip with me. This is incongruous and inequitable and leaves passengers in unfortunate situations. Enforcement of Allegiant specifications would appear to be at the whim of the staff on duty, rather than being consistently applied by all staff at all Allegiant service counters. The staff at the Allegiant counter at LEX, including the Manager on duty, did not appear to have empathy for my situation, and did not care that the pet carrier was allowed on a prior Allegiant flight.

I arrived to the airport right at 4 and was in what I thought was the line I needed to be in to check my bag only for them to keep calling for Denver flights and never once mentioned Las Vegas. So several of us made our own line since the Denver flight was their main priority while I’ve already been waiting to check in my bag for almost 45 min which was 5:00 am by that time. So I was next in line and looked away for literally one minute to turn around and see that an old lady had jumped in from of me. Although I was in a panic pressed for time I let it slide because I do respect my elders little did I know she was blind and needed special services which took around 20 min for them to check her bag then walk her to her seat then waits with her for someone to accompany her. So by the time I was able to check in the lady that worked with Allegiant was extremely rude and immediately told me I couldn’t check my bag as it was too late (mind you I had been in that line for over an hour at that point). So she told me I could go through TSA with my checked bag. So me being determined to go on my trip that I had planned months prior I attempted it. Once I waited in the TSA line for another 20 min waiting on the dogs to sniff everything then they had to search my suitcase bc it had all of my big bottles of toiletries that I had just bought so they could throw them all away. By this time it’s 5:50 so with tears in my eyes I asked the TSA gentleman to please hurry bc I was about to miss my flight. By time he was done it was already 6am and I had just missed my flight! So I immediately call Allegiant to express my frustration after waiting on hold for over two hours just to speak with someone I explained the situation and although they admitted to it being their fault and me being there in plenty of time because of the unorganization. They refused to give me a refund and only gave me $842 towards a future flight although my total flight was $1400.

Called the next day, the morning of our flight, was on hold for over 3 hours and had to hang up as it was time to board my plane. I emailed Allegiant over a week ago about this issue, still no response. At the airport today, with my veteran husband. According to their website we’re each allowed 2 checked bags as long as we’re on the same itinerary. Nope, lady insisted I needed a spouse ID card as well. I asked for the manager, who just stood there and did nothing. I asked for her to connect me with the Customer care center. She handed me a card with the same phone number as I called last week, 702-505-8888 for which no one will answer, ever. My only option was to pay the additional $100 to check 2 bags. So far, this trip with Allegiant has cost me an additional $200. I’m aware they change for everything, however, this never should’ve happened! Lesson learned.

We booked a quick weekend getaway to Las Vegas. The flight out from Belleville was delayed almost an hour, not in love with this but, hey, we’re going to Vegas so let’s just be happy and enjoy. That’s what we did and it all worked out. After spending a few days there we were enjoying our last afternoon and preparing for dinner and a show and I hear my wife say “OH NO!” We found out around 6:00p.m. That our flight for the next morning had just been cancelled. Saturday evening plans had to be put on hold. We tried finding alternate flights and Allegiant had none to offer. Other airlines were filling up faster than we could book seats. We had a 3 way call with our in-laws as well as our daughter and we were all trying to get seats on a flight so we could get home today (Sunday) to pick our pet up and prepare for the workweek. Finally our daughter text us at 10:00 Saturday night telling us Southwest had just opened a flight that would depart at 5:30a.m. this morning 04/03/2022. We were fortunate enough to be able to jump online and get 2 seats booked so we could get home. Those tickets cost us and additional $1,400. Allegiant messaged us telling us how sorry they were and that they would give us a $150 voucher to be used on a future flight They wanted us to know they were here for us and appreciate us. We aren’t interested in a voucher! We are interested in our money back and the difference we had to pay because of the inept business practices of Allegiant Air. We don’t know if we are even getting a refund on our tickets because when we try to call they are experiencing higher than normal call volume and our wait time is approximately 2 hours. They suggested we call between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 4:00a.m. Pacific time.  Allegiant left us and a lot of other customers high and dry. If possible they have seen their last dime from my family.

While I was booking the flight the website kept glitching and trying to refresh. I finally got their tickets booked. So yesterday on 3/23/22 I pull up their itinerary to check them in and print their boarding passes, I get an error message saying it is not within the 24 hour time frame to check in. So, I immediately look at the departure date and time and realized that the departure date was incorrect. I then checked the return date and it was the same exact day 3/27/22. So the flight ""I supposedly booked"" was supposed to depart at 8.52am to land in McAllen at 10.55am then to get off that plane and board the next plane since it departs at 11.38am and come right back home. I tried to modify the flight to correct it. They were wanting to charge me $652 to change the date. I looked up the correct flight and realized that there were not many passengers on that flight. I called the (702) 505-8888 and waited for 5 hours and 25 minutes with no response. My phone died. I ended driving to the airport and of course there was not anyone at the desk. I sat down and tried the ""chat with a live agent"" option before leaving the airport. The website told me it would be a 25 minute wait. I waited for those 25 minutes and more and I got a ""Null Response"" whatever that meant and the screen never changed. So at this point the only chance I had to modify the itinerary was to go to the airport the morning of. We show up this morning, I immediately politely ask to speak to a manager. They said it was only a supervisor present. I explained the situation and told her I would mind to pay the difference of the tickets of what they cost today. The whole trip came out to be $338 for 4 passengers. The ""supervisor"" stated that she could not make any changes on her computer, that she would have to call CS. She then reiterated everything I told her. She said to make the changes they are going to charge you $780 and that's waiving the $75 modification fee. I told her I was not going to pay the $780. I was willing to pay half of $780. Why could not they catch the error, I booked the dates correctly. Had their system had not glitched we probably would not have this problem. The flight was empty! Less than 30 had booked that flight. I asked to speak to the guy on customer service, but they said I could not talk to him. I would have to call that 702 area code number. They came back and said the best they could do was for me to pay $554 after tax Which I ended up paying. There is really no one you can talk to. No one answers that customer service number they provide. The chat service is a hoax. I've read on multiple sights that they do not respond to emails.

The last four times I have flown with Allegiant Air the flight either got canceled or delayed by more than five hours. This last trip was the last straw. I had 2 major issues this last time and I will highlight them below. 1. I am legally blind so I require extra help getting where I need to go. For the most part a family member or friend that takes me to the airport gets me to my gate and at least gets me in line to point me in the right direction. I was sitting in the gate area with my grandmother and was basically denied service. My grandmother walked up to the Gate counter and asked the gate agent when we started boarding if someone would just walk me to my seat. The man at the desk said and I quote “you need to stay with him. We are short staffed right now and since he’s not in a wheelchair he is considered lower priority“. So  just because I’m not in a wheelchair means that my disability isn’t credible enough for you to care. Eventually a gracious passenger who was sitting next to me in the gate area offered to help me. Speaks a lot of volumes when the people getting paid to do this stuff can’t even do their jobs.  The flight was delayed by four hours which I understand does happen and it’s out of the control of allegiance staff. Where I take issue is when we get literally zero updates about what is going on. My 84-year-old grandfather picking me up in Greenville had to sit there for over two hours because he had no idea when I was getting in and I could only give him updates when I received them. A very poor customer service. In conclusion this is one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown.

They are literally incompetent and do not care at all about their passengers. I had a flight scheduled from Vegas to Spokane that was canceled less than forty eight hours in advance. I did understand this, since many flights are being canceled due to COVID. However, this airline has been unbelievably unhelpful since my flight was canceled. I originally waited on the phone for more than an hour and a half to get in contact with a customer service representative to see if there was any way they could help me rebook my flight or provide compensation, as every flight is obviously significantly more expensive now than when I booked my flight on Allegiant several months ago. As this airline barely goes anywhere and has no relationship with any other airlines, they provided no way for me to get to my destination and did not seem to care at all that I'm now stuck without a way back to school. The airline did provide a small voucher for having to cancel the flight last minute but the voucher did not work, saying that my intended method of receiving the voucher was not working. I am counting on this voucher to help purchase another flight but am unable to get in contact with anyone from this garbage airline. The call wait time is scheduled for more than three hours, I received an automated response to my email saying that it would take upwards of a week to respond and that I needed to call instead. The online chat is unavailable. I thought I knew what I was getting myself into by booking Allegiant, but it's worse than I could have ever imagined.

My husband booked a flight to Las Vegas, they changed his flight there from night to morning, so he had to miss a day of work and then they just cancelled his flight home, no reschedule. They refunded the ticket and then gave a $150 check to get another flight home on another airline. This would have been fine, but all the other airlines were way over this amount. Because it was cancelled 2 days before the flight, the prices for flights to get back home were mostly over $500! I called Allegiant to ask how $150 was supposed to get him home and their answer was that it was nice of them to give the $150 and basically we have to pay the rest out of pocket. So either we pay the remaining amount, or my husband lives in Las Vegas now. We will never fly Allegiant again, and will discourage anyone from ever flying with them, even though they were so kind to give us a voucher for another flight with them in the future.

My grandma unexpectedly passed away and my sister and I needed to fly down from Anchorage, AK to Harlingen, TX for my grandma's cremation. We bought our tickets through Kayak.com; we were supposed to leave from Anchorage and fly straight to LAX (Los Angeles, CA) with Alaska Airlines and then from LAX straight to McAllen, TX with Allegiant. We already had to worry about the hassle of getting off of our Alaska Airlines flight, getting our luggage, bringing it to the Allegiant counter to re-check the baggage, and then going back through security in LAX to get to our gate with Allegiant, and we had less than an hour to get it all done! By some miracle, the plane leaving LAX was delayed, but even with the delay and us running our butts off through the terminals we just made it to the gate .... only to find out 20 mins later that the flight was completely cancelled due to crew. Allegiant refused to give my sister and me any kind of assistance out if a situation they put is in. We were 100% stranded in LA; since this trip was last minute and sudden, we had used all of our money plus help friends to get down to TX in the first place. When the flight to McAllen was cancelled, the only thing Allegiant offered was a refund plus compensation OR a rebooking on the next flight to McAllen which wasn't until Saturday morning. Mind you, the cancelled flight was supposed to fly out at 8 AM Wednesday morning, and the next flight out was Saturday morning. There were no hotel vouchers offered to help with the two day wait time, which left my sister and me stranded in the airport. Allegiant didn't bother to help with finding any type of connecting flights. Even if you had elected the refund, there was a 5 - 10 business day wait on actually receiving the refund, so we couldn't exactly go back to the counters to buy another ticket to McAllen, which was THE only other solution Allegiant offered; which was even more money out of my pocket that I didn't have. When I asked them if there were ANY other options they could help with, all I was told was that I could elect to receive the refund and compensation OR wait for the next flight. Those were my only two options, with no other assistance at all out of the airport. They said those were my only two options: refund and compensation or wait for Saturday morning. With no where to wait. I've never had such a horrible experience flying. Ever. When we started trying to call around to see if there was any other airline that could get us out, the other airline's response was ""well at least they can go wait at the hotel while we figure this out"" and when we told them Allegiant hadn't even offered any type of hotel vouchers or anything, even THEY were shocked. Like I said, this was my first experience flying with Allegiant and it was horrible enough that I will avoid them at all costs and will tell everyone I know to do the same.

I left a voicemail stating the claim number and never heard back from them after calling numerous times.

My daughter was gone for 7 days! There are 7 days worth of clothes, and their grandparents bought stuff for them. How do you account for something that was purchased a long time ago!? That is insane! The luggage was probably had about $500 worth of stuff in it. Granted mostly clothes, but it was money spent!

When I finally was answered, I asked what “operational reasons” means and they wouldn’t tell me a specific, but would say it could mean staffing issues, supply shortages etc. When I finally get a flight 4 days later, my bag weighed 1 pound over the 40 point limit (I had to buy some more clothes since my trip length more than doubled). The lady at check in tells me the extra weight is $50! I ask to quickly pull a couple things out to move into my carry on and she acts all disgusted. I then leave my bag and get through security to my gate when I get called over the intercom to return to the check in counter. When I get there the lady asks what I did with the luggage losing sticker on my suitcase. I say I did nothing and she is accusing me of removing it. She then asks if I was traveling with someone and I reply that I am (my wife). And she then accuses that she must’ve removed it! I assure her that isn’t possible because she wasn’t even with me at check in counter when I dropped off the bag. She then tells me to wait there and goes trying to check all over the airport for the sticker that must’ve fallen off. She finally returns with my bag and discovers that the sticker was stuck on the bottom all along… She then tries to tell me that it was my fault for setting my suitcase on the scale wrong? (I set it on its side and she stuck the sticker on the bottom). To fix her mistake she tells me to go to the back of the regular check in line and wait to get a new bag tag to put the sticker on the top!

One passenger ended up crying and saying how they will never be flying Allegiant again and how terrible the service is.

They have continued to decline in service but for the price I don't expect it to be perfect. I’ve had two flights canceled by them leaving me stranded, because of Covid I have been more than understanding, however my last experience will insure I never use them again. I bought a ticket for my brother to visit me. I paid extra for all the protection and ability to change my flight especially due to covid and issues arising with that. Sure enough a Covid issue occurred and I needed to reschedule my flight. I tried going online and couldn’t change my flight, I called the customer service number and it was disconnected, I tried the chat and there was no one there. I started this process of trying to get a hold of them three weeks before the flight. I emailed their customer service three times. No response. A week before the flight with no other choice I canceled the flight instead of rescheduling it. Now I am out all of the fees and processing of the flight instead of being able to reschedule it at no cost. I received a voucher and when I tried to look into booking another flight there were no flights out of LAX for the rest of the year and none into next as well. My voucher is only good until April of 2022 which is a year from when I bought the ticket not the flight in July. After researching I discovered they are moving terminals at my airport which is why I'm guessing they have no flights, so I will have to drive to another city to use my voucher and fly out of it. My option is Vegas which means I have to fly or drive there (will cost more than the voucher is worth) they are not helping with the situation or extending my time considering I cannot fly due to their issue not mine. Today I received an email stating that they received my email to them more than a month ago and over two weeks after my flight was to take place. If you don’t have people to answer your phones or answer your chats and your email responses are taking place after the flight that the issue was about you shouldn’t be in business.

Left many many people stranded and some not being able to see injured love one’s for the last time and such. I am 16 flying with a friend who is also 16 and we payed for this trip ourselves. We also relied on getting there last night at some point. If we didn’t have a family member in town we would have been screwed also considering it wasn’t an overnight stay airport. It was cheap, but in the long run was more expensive than Delta and United. Wish we would have just went Delta and United like we normally do. It’s almost ensured that they will get you there in a timely manner and safely.

2021-07-18,1,10,"""extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory""",Sean Ceron,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had an extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory experience with Allegiant. We have flown with many airlines, and when a situation arises for someone to give up their seat for monetary compensation, there is never an issue. We were to fly out July 9, from Stewart International Airport on flight 2278 to Sanford, FL. The flight was overbooked. Therefore, the gate agent started by requesting 3 volunteers to be bumped for $200 cash and a rebooked flight. No one offered including us. After a few minutes the gate agent announced the offer was now $400 and a rebooking. Again we did not offer nor did anyone else. A short time after, the gate agent announced an offer of $800 and a rebooking. This offer piqued our interest and the 3 members of our party volunteered. As we walked to the gate agent, other passengers commented to us they wish they could volunteer, but couldn’t  - comments were overheard exclaiming “$800 dollars cash, that would be nice”. We arrived to the gate agent, who we later came to know was the station manager. She was overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to get on the plane and asked us to hold tight and wait to “take care of us”. When the flight was all boarded with the gate doors closed and the plane pulling away, she commenced the process of arranging our compensation. To our shock and extreme disappointment, we soon received emails containing a link to only flight credits, and not the monetary compensation we were expecting. She simply shrugged us off and said we misunderstood her and the only option was the $200 cash or the flight credits. We insisted that she call again and tell them we were told $800 and not flight credit, however after getting off the phone, she told us take it or leave it, $200 in monetary compensation or the Flight credits, even telling us that no airline would give that much as compensation. This we know for a fact not to be true, as we have had previous experiences with other airlines (American, Delta, United, Jet blue) which have offered $400, $600 even up to $1200 for giving up a seat. At this point, apparently the state trooper was called, however we were at no time violent, not swearing, not being belligerent or yelling. We were strongly defending our position for what we and all the other passengers around the gate clearly understood was offered, $800 per passenger for the 3 seats that were needed. We insisted that the manager call again and tell the office we were not satisfied with the $200, she again stated we were wrong, and that we would never get more than the $200. We told her to call again and speak to a manager, which she finally did. The result was a $400 offer which we reluctantly accepted. There was an email that was supposed to come through, and she informed us just to leave and we would receive it within 15 minutes. Our trust in the airline had been clearly damaged, so we did not wish to leave until we received the email. She left us there telling us it would come through and that she was done. She walked away and left us with the state trooper to escort us out. This is how Allegiant repays their passengers who inconvenience themselves to allow the airline to carry on with the scheduled flight, give us less money and call the police to escort us away. The offer as was understood by all present at the gate was $800, now we were stuck in NY for 3 more days until our rescheduled flight",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Stewart to Orlando Sanford', 'Date Flown': 'July 2021', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

When we get to the airport and board, we are notified we have to deboard the plane for maintenance, no big deal. However, once we are off the plane we were not given any update for about 30 minutes. Finally we are told we'll be boarding around 5.30pm. Our original delayed depart time was 3.30pm. Once we are back on the plane, we remain at the gate for about 35-40 minutes with no update. We eventually leave the gate, maybe take one lap around the airport and the pilot let's us know the computers are having issues related to the heat outside. A few minutes later, he says we cannot take this aircraft to San Antonio and all the passengers receive a notification that we'll be leaving from a different gate. Fine, no big deal. Everyone is under the impression we are changing planes and will be on our way. They ask everyone to deboard again, and wait until everyone is off to inform us that our flight has been cancelled. It is now close to 8pm, 10pm central time in Texas. There are no flights coming back to Las Vegas tonight that will be returning to Texas. Because Allegiant waited so long to call it quits, about 4 people were able to jump to another airline and get home Sunday evening. We ended up having to spend over double what we paid round trip for a Southwest flight the next morning to go one way. We were also forced to find a place to stay because Allegiant did not accommodate the displaced passengers. It was ultimately a stressful and exhausting 24 hours due to the lack of communication from the Allegiant crew on the ground. Many people may have been able to find better accommodations that were not ridiculously expensive had our flight been cancelled much earlier.

Allegiant requires you to pay for any seat choice, and if you do not choose and pay for a seat, they will give you the worst seat to encourage you to pay for a better seat.

The trip started with an understandable weather delay which developed into a 36 he mechanical delay because the plane was not properly maintained during the storm. Allegiant refused to recognize it as mechanical issue instead of weather despite the fact that other airlines were flying in and out in those conditions. This delay cost me an overnight stay waiting for the flight to either be fixed or a rescue plane sent. Additional cost for food as there was only one venue available and we were told to stay near the gate.

Unfortunately not only did we still have to pay for that day, but I had to scramble to find a place to stay for the night in Vegas AND pay for that too.

Had we had that extra day we would have been a day ahead of the weather. I am extremely disappointed in the communication received by your airline and completely disappointed that we had to spend in excess of an extra 300.00 that I was not expecting to spend. I understand short delays but we literally lost an entire day, an excessive amount of money and lots of good weather. I do want to acknowledge however that the 2 male flight attendants were simply amazing and recognize them for their good work. I sent this to Allegiant and was told that there would be zero compensation. I was quoted an FAA quote that says that they don't have to do anything.

After a brief conversation with her supervisor she said I could board. I had to promise to keep the mask on. I was the last person on the plane.

We then submitted an official complaint to the FAA. Three days later, we have yet to receive a response. So much for government accountability! Allegiant Flight 582 on May 24, 2020 from Mesa, AZ to Pasco, WA Regarding the subject flight, we were very concerned about the crowded conditions on the subject plane. Most rows had every seat taken. In our row the middle seat was taken by an individual who was not a family member and not wearing a mask.  My wife, Marjorie and I are also a member of a vulnerable group, age 70 and above. There was never any opportunity given to us to request to be seated in a row that complied with social distance guidelines. We wore masks and gloves for the entire flight, but wonder if these measures were sufficient given the crowded conditions in your plane. I might remind you that New York subways had high death rates when train were crowded with passengers. There were a number of children who were crying almost the entire flight. The flight attendant did give a bottle of water to one of the infants, and that seem to calm that child down. What other measures might have been taken like giving some candy? Upon boarding your plane, we were given a package containing a mask, gloves and Sani wipes but there was no requirement to use them. We noted that the next flight announced boarding before we even reached the luggage area. I conclude that the plane could not have been completely cleaned by the airline personnel! Thinking back on our flight, boarding was started 10 or 15-minutes after the last passenger debarked! I conclude that both flights (and most likely all flights made by that plane on that day) could not have been properly cleaned. Was it your plan to leave up to passengers to clean their own areas? If so, this deficiency should have been announced to all passengers. We were not traveling for pleasure, instead travel for us was essential as we were attending the funeral of my father who died at an age of 95.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Mesa to Pasco', 'Date Flown': 'May 2020', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Ground Service': 3, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Then I get no information outside of “your flight has been delayed”. You can’t even speak to a real person because they are so cheap that the ticket agents double as boarding agents. This airline has two planes that leave this airport a day. How on earth they have a mechanical or otherwise delay is beyond me. I can guarantee that the only thing keeps these planes in the air is the FAA because the amount of dollar stretching is ridiculous. I’ve personally seen this airline make people miss cruises, hold people hostage in an airport (because the tiny airport TSA checkpoint closed so you couldn’t leave and come back), and make you wait over an hour on hold to talk to an actual person. I tried to allow them to reimburse me for my day lost on my trip but the fact that each and every time they screw something up to me is unacceptable. I hope this company gets the exposure they deserve - that they are run by people who care more about profits than passengers. The flight crew has been nice so it’s clearly not the ground staff.

We started boarding later than the scheduled time, and after sitting on the plane for a little while, an announcement was made that there was an issue with a filter that the crew was working on resolving. Shortly after, we were asked to deplane, as they were having trouble removing the old filter. Once we had deplaned, an announcement was made that they were working on the issue.

Another announcement was made by Allegiant staff that they were still working to get a replacement plane and crew in tonight. They informed us that if not, our flight would be move to around 0800 am in the morning, and that we would be provided with hotel vouchers.

This original number of drinks was not enough for everyone, and no other drinks were offered. This was late at a small airport, so there were no vendors open to offer other drink choices or food.

This isn't a fancy airline, my ticket was $48. I wasn't expecting premium service, seats, or attendants and I got what I paid for, which was perfectly adequate in all 3 cases. Yes, they ding you on the luggage. The information is however, literally the 1st thing found when you google ""baggage information Allegiant airline"". It's 40 lbs per bag, not 50 so I spent 30 minutes the night before pitching things to make my 2 bags each go from 43 and 44 lbs, to 37 and 38, respectively. I carry a travel luggage scale with me (best $10 you'll ever spend) and if you don't have 1, Walmart carries them, they weigh about an ounce. Upgrade to a seat with more leg room, you'll be glad of it. For $48 I felt like I could afford it and was reasonably sure I wasn't going to have to cough up an extra $50 per bag at check in. Again, glad I did. No, there's no complimentary anything on these flights, but so what? Get food and bring it with you! There were no delays so I can't comment on that, but it does seem to be a problem with this airline. The attendants were quite friendly, no complaints there. I get it guys, you're there at check in thinking one thing, only to hear something else. Maybe it's because I travel a lot, but it was honestly the work of 30 seconds to find out they only honor 40 lbs on their check in bags and yeah, you bet I was grateful I'd looked ahead of time. When I got to Harrisburg I went to Walmart and restocked what I'd thrown out. Cost? $13.66.

This flight gave me the ability to leave Wednesday afternoon and return late Sunday night. Due to military training running late I wasn’t able to make my first flight to meet my family and had to purchase a ticket for the following day. I don’t blame this on Allegiant which is why I was more than willing to purchase my one way ticket getting me home for the holiday the following day. As I have purchased a round trip ticket as long as I get home my return flight has been paid for and I will be able to use it to get back to my duty station. Come time to check in Sunday morning for my late afternoon flight my reservation, I already paid for, popped up as cancelled. Leaving me stranded without a way to get back to work. I called Allegiant immediately to inquire as to why I no longer had a reservation for my seat I paid for as a customer, they said they reserved the right to void my purchase and keep the funds without telling me about it. Essentially saying I, as the paying customer of a service am required to communicate, but Allegiant does not have to communicate. Allegiant left me no choice but for me to pay for another one way ticket for a seat on a flight I already paid for.

The 40lb. weight limit on bags is laughable and purely designed to get customers to pony up an additional $50 per bag for even the slightest overage. The check-in agents were rude ... one of them even caused a scene that led to the line being slowed for nearly 10 minutes. The planes are crammed with no room to place your carry-on under the seat. We were traveling with our small emotional support dog (which they charged us for despite documentation). He was in a carrier that fit the airline's prescribed parameters, but we couldn't get him far enough under the seat because of the limited space. The flight attendant told us he needed to go further under the seat, but that was impossible. We finally convinced her we couldn't get him any further under the seat without hurting him, but she didn't make it easy. The plane took forever to take off as we sat for quite sometime before we even began to taxi. All in all, it was a pretty awful experience. As one commenter mentioned, you shouldn't waste your money.

Once they have the plane boarded, they are free to take off which ends up with early arrival. I recommend purchasing the tickets at the airport whenever possible as they will exclude the tax which is about $35-40 per RT ticket. We also use flex trip which allows for unlimited changes to your flight. The seats on all aircraft I’ve flown have been redone however still do not recline which some look at as a problem (unless your the 6’4 person behind the recliner).

2019-09-17,2,10,"""just let it be over soon""",Frederick Cline,"Not Verified |  Medford to Los Angeles. This is the first time I had flown Allegiant Airlines. Ticket counter agents seemed to take longer to process people than other airlines. While waiting at the gate, the time became close to boarding time, but nothing happened, no announcements, etc. The time eventually even passed takeoff time with everyone still waiting to board and no announcements regarding the delay. Finally, we boarded the plane an hour after scheduled takeoff time and the captain on board the plane explained over the intercom that something happened earlier in the day to throw off the schedule and ""they hoped to make it up to us in the future"" (an odd statement, given that it is impossible to make up a time delay). So we are an hour behind our takeoff time and the ticket agent (now on board the plane) begins to call out particular passenger names to see if these people are on board. I'm wondering, wouldn't they already know who's onboard from the tickets being scanned at the gate? Then the same agent begins going down the rows, one by one, saying the first name of each passenger that is supposed to be in that seat and wanting those passengers to confirm their identity. I had never seen this before in all my years of flying (I'm 58 years old). I'm thinking, there must be an easier way! I took some Benadryl prior to the flight for allergies, hoping that it would knock me out and I would have a blissful nap en route but, lo and behold, the seats don't recline, even the slightest bit (no button on the armrests, etc.). When did this become normal? How am I supposed to nod off in the full upright position? The seats are also thinner (less cushion) than those of other airlines. Oh well, I'll just read the inflight magazine. But it is very thin as well, more like a pamphlet, without any interesting articles. I look at the beverages available on the flight and I see that there is a charge for everything. Not even a free soda like other airlines. Aren't sodas about 12 cents a can when purchased in bulk? Well, I'm not paying $3 for a 12 cent soda! Apparently I'm not the only fussy passenger - there is a baby behind me that starts crying which inspires other babies to start crying. Unfortunately, they are healthy babies with lots of energy and they don't stop crying for most of the remainder of the flight. I'm thinking, ""Oh please, God, just let it be over soon"". We finally touch down. Babies still crying. One hour after our scheduled departure time.

2019-09-01,2,10,"""a very stressful situation""",C Stanner,"✅ Trip Verified |  St Pete Clearwater to South Bend. The original flight for me was to return on August 28th. We left with plenty of time to spare. Traffic was backed up and horrendous. There was a very bad accident on the freeway, and we made it to the airport at 8:45am. The plane was to leave at 9:00am. My daughter and I had no bags to check and I was already prechecked in and ready to go. We knew it was a longshot, but we went straight to the gate just to see if I can make it. We were informed that the plane had already left. We looked at our app that had originally still said 9:00 AM it changed to the plane had left at 8:51 AM. We remained calm and went to the ticket counter to see what could be done. As time passed and the lady continued to attempt to help us, she let us know we would be charged 75 dollars as a comp fee for a flight on Saturday. We immediately felt upset and I had a panic attack. People behind us had also missed their flight and began to complain. The woman and another woman behind the counter began to become upset with those of us that missed our flight stating that we should have been there two hours prior. We asked to speak to a manager. The second woman kept saying “well many others were here on time, they were two hours early as you should have been, we can’t hold the plane for you”.  We kept saying “we know you can’t hold the plane that’s not what we’re asking we don’t understand why we have to pay again when it’s not our fault that we missed“. We explained to the lady that we did not want to compare ourselves to others that were not on the road when we were on the road that were not affected by the accident like we were affected. She appeared to have no remorse. As they began to get a manager they asked those of us that missed the flight to step aside to another side and that we would be served once he came to the counter. A family came up and got in line and it had been maybe two minutes before a gentleman came to the counter, one of the people who missed their flight was a little old woman who went up to him thinking he must be the manager. However they told her that she needed to wait her turn that those behind her were actually in line, and had been waiting an hour to check in for their flight. Although maybe their perception of an hour is different or maybe it was the stress, but those people had just gotten there and those of us that were waiting for figuration of our missed flight and the cost of a second flight since it was not our fault that we missed our plane, we had only been waiting maybe 30 minutes if not less. What seemed like an eternity during the situation was really not that long, and those of us that had missed our flight were the only ones standing in line until they moved us aside and a family came up right behind us. Overall it was a very stressful situation with customers just wanting some clarification and understanding from the company and workers of the company just not having remorse and probably feeling stressed themselves as well. Overall the manager came and comped to all the flights for free for those of us who were involved in the freeway of the accident that had occurred and we were not able to make it to the airport. Although we greatly appreciate the consideration and understanding and compassion of their manager it still can’t be helped to feel uncomfortable or uneasy and just simply sad and stressed over it all.",yes,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'St Pete Clearwater to South Bend', 'Date Flown': 'August 2019', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

I don't normally submit a review but I wanted to share my experience. The fee-happy structure is intimidating and your experience can be different than what you are used to on another airline. At the Airport, plan for more time at the ticket counter. Individual flights seem to have their own line. Don't get in the wrong line. Plan on more time with the ticket counter agent. If you are checking a bag or carrying on a bag, they will review this information with you. You will receive a tag for your carry on. Your carry on luggage may well be considered ""too large"" and will need to be checked. Similarly, your checked bag can only be 40 lbs (most airlines give you 50 lbs). Make sure your luggage conforms to their published dimensions and weight. What is considered carry-on size for Delta may need to be checked on Allegiant. There is a lot of homework to do or you could end up with an unpleasant surprise. What I found that WAS a very pleasant surprise is that if you are a veteran and can prove it - you can check up to 3 bags and a carry on for FREE! It is the most generous offering in the industry. There are other perks for veterans too, so check their website for a full,detailed list. The flight was on time, the flight crew was pleasant. They made it quite clear that nothing on that beverage and snack cart was free and they went through the cabin very quickly. It was easy to move around since the the carts swept through the cabin much quicker than airlines which give complimentary snacks and beverages. The chairs (I won't call them seats) were narrow, hard and did not recline. For the hour flight we had, it was fine. For the price, I did not mind at all. For my destination, they make only two flights per week. Its a little scary to think about a cancelled flight, so that is a risk you must be willing to take.

However, since I did it through air allegiant I couldn’t. They have to do it. This is probably why they were unwilling to help us make the flight.

Absolute horrible experience from the get go. On the way back to Vegas, Memphis airport only had 1 person checking in bags! We were in line again for over an hour! Also, we tried once again to pre check bags since it’s cheaper, this time it would not let us pre check ANYTHING or even check in early because we had our children with us and they had placed us all in different seats. So, due to Allegiant Ais inefficiency, we were over charged on this trip over $100 because of luggage, their inadequate app they try to get you to use and double charging us for luggage.

We know that it’s a definitely a budget bare bones airline. However they recently started a route that flies directly to his parents hometown so we thought how do we pass that up? I’m a nurse so the best way I can write this review and explain would be in military time. Day one 0800 - get an alert on our phone that our 0900 flight will be delayed about an hour. We were instructed to wait in the gate area. Announced that for weather reasons the flight may take off at 1000, they will keep up posted. Boarded flight and take off around 1030 to Sarasota destination. 1200 get an announcement on the plane that we are about 50min our from our destination and are beginning our descent. 1230, updated that a plane ahead of us encountered bad weather and we are being rerouted to Destin, Florida so we can refuel and then take off once the storm has passed. Water and Chex mix were passed out. Taxied around Destin on the plane until about 1340 and then are given the option to get off the plane at Destin. Three other Allegiant flights had also been detoured. The tiny Destin airport was completely overwhelmed with an hour long Quiznos line and a handful of outlets that were being guarded for dear life. 1530 got an announcement all flights to Sarasota should reboard. Boarded, watched the seatbelt demonstration etc and were taxing for about 45min assuming that we were just waiting our turn to take off. 1630 announced that our plane didn’t pass one of the maintenance checks and that they needed to have some people come out and work on the plane. 1700 from the captain “well the bad news just keeps on coming” now our crew was reaching their maximum work time and they would need to find a new crew. 1710 - deboarded for a second time. Announced overhead the flight would be leaving around 1800. 1755 - announced our flight was canceled and would be rescheduled for the following day at 0700. All chaos then ensued. In the announcement it was said to see the ticket counter for our voucher for a hotel and meal. One long line of our entire flight (200 people) wrapped around the ticket area and multiple times we were instructed to split off into different lines that ended up making zero sense. Two times we followed the instructions given by Allegiant staff that ended up having us in a completely different area while the main line continued to move. People were absolutely heated and little to no information was being distributed. Where were these hotels? How would we get there? Destin is a small city with only a handful of Ubers. We were asked by one Allegiant staff member in a loud tone “if we even knew how a line worked.” Probably not the tone you want to use with a bunch of confused customers who have been standing in lines and waiting going on 12 hours. Then without warning the line structure went out the window and the Allegiant staff started yelling out passenger names with the paper voucher in their hands. Three employees were yelling names over each other and sometimes just using first names, not very helpful. To the lucky that got their names called they got a second piece of paper with five hotel options we could call and book to see if they had availability for us, a few hotels didn’t even know if they accepted the Allegiant voucher so that was not encouraging. Unfortunately we never got our names called so we waited in the ticket counter line for over an hour and got our voucher around 1945.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Indianapolis to Sarasota', 'Date Flown': 'April 2019', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Ready? Hard copy of the eticket boarding pass? 5 bucks. Make it through TSA, awaiting zone to be called when I hear announcement in gate area “Those of you carrying any carry on’s will be checked on your ticket to confirm you are allowed to carry a bag on our airline.” A standard size carry on to be placed in the overhead bin the day of travel at the airport of your departure, 50 bucks, but wait, there’s more! So a standard size carry on 14 x 9 x 22. A checked bag the day of travel at the airport of your departure, 50 bucks, not weighing more than 40 lbs and a maximum size of 80 linear inches (H + W + D). A 40 lb bag vs a light 15 pound bag, literally dropping off before the TSA screening vs carrying onto the plane is the same cost. Well as I’m one of the last several people to board the plane, spot several empty seats. As to not be a jerk to the 2 people that are seated and to make them get up and move, so I can grab a window seat, I say “That’s alright, no worries, I’ll just hop in a seat over here.” No, I’m told not until we are in the air, only when the seatbelt sign has been turned off by a stern flight attendant.” Lady from NY that is seated next to me says, we would have chosen different seats elsewhere, but it would’ve been an extra 40 bucks (20 each) to choose. At this point I’m doing the math in my head and am just glad the plane is leaving on time and we’re in the air. So I go to the iPad and begin to watch some mindless Netflix. 45 minutes later, our snack / drink service comes around. Dehydrated from the early coffee and altitude, I ask for cup of ice water. “We have bottles for 2.00.” Oh, well then how about a ginger ale on ice? “Yes sir, that will also be 2.00” Ah, I see, no thanks, what about a bag of pretzels or nuts then? “Yes sir, 4.00”. I just laughed at that point and said, I’ll just wait until we land. Talk about a nickel and dime airline. Unbelievable. Worst experience I’ve ever encountered. The worst part as a consumer, make your policies known in large font on your home page before people decide to purchase “A good deal airfare ticket.” Wait, better not, your customer purchases would probably rapidly drop and your company would lose millions.

I attempted to put my bag in the overhead bin, but it was closed, and I was quickly corrected that those were reserved for rows 1 and 2 passengers and their items.

I was thinking how inconvenient this would be when I went to get off the plane, as I would have to backtrack to get my personal items. As rows 1 and 2 filled, the flight attendant opened those 2 overhead bins, and after there was no more traffic from passengers boarding the plane, I realized there was still plenty of space to put my small carry on bag right above my seat. As I got up and went several rows back to grab my bag and move it, the flight attendant quickly corrected me and told me they were still waiting on 1 more passenger and they may need that space. She was rude and loud. I told her if another passenger boarded and there was not room for my belongings, that I would move them again. She replied with another rude comment, rolled her eyes, and kept to herself. Another passenger never boarded. There would have been space for my belongings the entire time, as there should have been, because again, I paid for this seat, and I have just as much right as any other passenger to store my personal belongings near me. The FA was so rude that even the other passengers around me noticed, and were caught off guard by her attitude. When exiting the plane after landing in Louisville, I grabbed my carry on (which was now above me in the overhead bin due to me moving it), and watched as the FA said ""Thank you for flying with Allegiant, have a good day!"" to passengers exiting before me; when I exited, she didn't look at me, nor wish me a good day.

Read the reviews and thought a delay would be the worst we would encounter since there were no layovers. Day prior to flying out, I received a call that our flight has already been delayed an entire 6 hours! That took away one full day by the time we arrived. Couldn’t imagine that it would get worse but of course it did. Arrive for our return flight and all appears on track to leave at the correct time. Then the delays started rolling in. First delay was for 30 minutes. Second delay pushed it back another hour. This continues until we are 4 hours past our departure time. Still all good long as we make it back (my girlfriend had an important meeting the following evening). Then the cancellation happened. Huge problem a stranding 100+ people with no option out until the following night at 6pm (30 hours after our selected departure time)! Immediately called customer service (as the line for the onsite crew ran into the food court). Customer service was zero help aside from reimbursing us for that leg of the trip. Found out from customs service the initial reason for the cancellation was due to weather. How is that possible when I’m looking at the weather in both locations and it looks impossible to be due to weather conditions. Upon mentioning that, customer service then stated it wasn’t actually due to weather but mechanical issues (found out later that this has been a huge problem with many Allegiant planes). No help finding flights out. No help finding hotel accommodations. No help in any way. I totally understand there is a limit to the help someone can provide over the phone but it came across like I knew more about the flight statuses and options going near our return location than customer support searching through their system. As all flights canceled one by one that were going to our home state, we resigned to the fact we’re going to need a place to stay or book another flight from Orlando. They literally expected everyone to crash in the airport or scramble to book a last minute flight for that evening or the following day. With a limited number of options to get back in time, we booked the last two seats on a flight that cost a whopping $2,200 total.

2019-01-03,1,10,"""won't be flying them again!""",Heather Evans,"Not Verified |  ""Ma'am - I really don't care if you fly Allegiant"" - Punta Gorda gate agent Jan 2, 2019. The gate agent for our flight (1596) today - Jan 2, 2019 was quite possibly the worst I have ever dealt with in my flying history. I've flown all over the world and our family flies every 4-6 weeks - mostly frequently between Rochester NY and Southwest Florida. Until this past year I refused to fly Allegiant due to their bad on-time and service record but heard through friends that it wasn't too bad and have since flown with them 8 times. Today - the gate agent in Punta Gorda went out of her way to be nasty. I realize that, for the most part, you get what you pay for. This is why I always pay for upgraded seats (meaning we sit forward in seating position - not to be confused with better, bigger seats - because they are not. Not a problem. I know that and do not expect bigger better seats - still I pay more). In all of the previous flights, prior to today, I have traveled with the same luggage that I carried on today. As we approached the gate agent rudely told us to get out of line and stand aside as we needed to pay for a carry on. I told her I had flown with the bag, never having paid before, her response was ""Well Today YOU DO."" We watched many others board with the same or larger bags, before my husband approached and said  ""these people have the same size bag, why are they not paying?"" She then looked for a passenger with a bag, took his phone from him and tried showing it to us. It was awkward and extremely unprofessional. When the rest of the plane had boarded and she was finally ready to ""deal"" with us and another passenger, she turned to us and said the bags we were boarding with had to be paid for. I  tried to explain once again that we had boarded the flight to PGD without incident, as well as many other Allegiant flights with the same bag. She could not have been ruder as she turned back and said that all of the of the other gate agents are not paying attention which, then, makes her job that much harder. At this point, I turned to my husband and said if this is the way Allegiant is going to treat people, we won't fly with them in the future. Having overheard my comment to my husband, the gate agent then addresses me and says ""Ma'am I really don't care! Thousands of people will."" WOW - through this whole ordeal I was thinking...it takes just as much energy to be nice as it does to be nasty - Yet she chose to be as snarky and rude as she could possibly be. I paid for a checked baggage, paid for seats, paid for my pet to fly - obviously I would have paid for a carry on bag if I had realized the necessity. This flight did change my opinion of Allegiant Air, what if the pilot and crew on board had the same ""Ma'am I really don't care attitude""?

Very rigid rules. The baggage restrictions are similar to other airlines as far as the maximum inches (H+W+L).. however if you're carrying on the plane, they want you to fit your carry-on in this skinny metal stand and if it doesn't fit they will charge a $50 fee. I was surprised because I had a piece of luggage that fit the maximum inches but because it didn't fit inside this skinny stand they made me pay and wouldn't refund my carry-on fee I paid for. Truth is if my carry-on was completely empty there was no way it would have fit, or anyone else's. I was shocked at how skinny it has to be.

I have two emotional support dogs that I have had for 10 years and I have flown with them on many airlines including Allegiant before with no trouble. I purchased a ticket in September to fly home and surprise my family in Cincinnati for Christmas. I received an email from Allegiant in November, 2 months after I bought my ticket, saying that the emotional support policy had changed. I downloaded the documents that they told me I had to have it cost me $220 to get health certificates for both my ESA dogs. I showed up at the airport with my letter a form they made my doctor fill out, my ESA forms that cost me 220 and I checked in at the ticket counter. she said everything was fine. I go up and wait for an hour and a half at the gate nobody says anything to me. I go to check in for the flight and the worst customer service employee ever says to me I have removed you from this flight we’re getting your bags removed from the plane you’re only allowed to have one ESA dog. I was shocked and I said what and she said you have been removed from the flight step aside. that was it so when I tried to get information she just kept saying you’re only allowed one is a dog and I said I flew Allegiant in June and we were allowed to have two. I’ve never had a problem and she said the policy change December 10. She spoke to me so horribly and I already suffer from crippling anxiety which is why I have the ESA dogs, I started to panic and hyperventilate and cry uncontrollably so bad that other customers were trying to help me and she was telling them to shut up that she didn’t have to talk to them. She was so cold never offered any assistance as to what I could do to fix it she just kept saying you’re off this flight.

This is hands down one of the absolute worst travel experiences I’ve had with the worst airline company I’ve ever dealt with. We are very unhappy and displeased & this is not our first issue with Allegiant. I am very upset with this company & bothered from start to finish!! They have lost many customers (myself, my family and friends) from this situation & their lack of help/response. We were at the airport & a very light snow flurry started that lasted less than 10 min. They tell us that there has to be a over ¼ of a mile visibility for the plane to land. Within a few minutes of the storm hitting we could see to the lake which is about 1 mile away. They then told us that the “plane does not have enough gas to circle while waiting for weather” They said that the plane had to fly back to Mesa (over an hr flight) to fuel up. We find this upsetting & hard to believe as the FAA has very specific rules and guidelines about how much gas a plane has to have. They should have had enough to circle & wait for the short flurry to pass. I have been on planes before that circled for 30 or more minutes before turning to go somewhere else. Even had a plane turn back around and land where we were supposed to after circling and waiting. So this is completely unacceptable! We are then told it will be a 2 hr delay (in the worst, most uncomfortable and claustrophobic airport I’ve been in) so they can go fill up the plane. This is upsetting & frustrating but we can handle a 2 hr delay. Shortly after this we are told that it would be even more delayed further into the evening causing a 10 hour delay. They said that they did not have snow removal equipment at the airport so the plane can’t come back. How does an airport in Utah not have snow removal equipment? It snows there half the year but they don’t have the equipment!! But then we see a snow plow in the parking lot.. All of this is completely uncalled for, unnecessary and ridiculous. If we had been in the Salt Lake airport we would have taken off and been in our destination on time. We had to pay for an uber to get us to and from the airport which cost us even more money. Thankfully we live within 30 min of the airport. When we got back to the airport there is another delay! The incoming plane doesn’t land until it is almost time for our flight to take off. They finally load the plane and we sit on the tarmac for an extended period of time waiting without any reason, they never told us why we weren’t taking off. Once we land we then sit on the tarmac again, once again with no explanation. When we were on the plane we were not offered anything as an apology, no free snacks or drinks from the over priced selection. Staff did not seem apologetic for the issues or problems with the flights! Our entire first day of the trip was completely gone and ruined!

Mobile check-in wasn’t working and people were being returned from security because passes weren’t being accepted. 1 person working behind ticket counter to process the entire flight! Working the final 7 people in line, she calls the gate (in front of me) to let them know how many people are left and that she’s working us thru and we will make the flight. Got thru security and to the gate only to find the pilot “made the decision” to depart on time and leave passengers standing at the gate. No luggage because it was already on the plane. No additional flight because there’s only 1 per day. Sit on hold 70 minutes to get a representative who re-books on different airline, for 10pm that night. Their flight was then delayed until the next day, so a hotel stay and nearly 24hrs later, we leave for our trip. Was told by Allegiant they were short-staffed that day which caused a disruption. The pilot was more concerned with leaving on-time than taking care of the customer. It’s beyond comprehension they could not wait an additional few minutes for the rest of the passengers to clear security since they only offger 1 flight every 3 days? So this “economy flight” ultimately cost more than traveling a normal airline, caused a lot of additional stress because of very little customer service, and ruined the first-time flight experience for a little girl.

There are plenty of seats left on the plane. I have never had this ever happen to me when we book together. We don’t care if we sit up front or in the back. Usually when you book together, you get seated together. Unless, it’s a full flight then I understand why seats are needed to be bought. Needless to say, it is not a full flight. We are traveling with an infant and of course they see that and had to split us up knowing we would have to pay to sit together. Like I said, never had this ever happen to us with any airline. There were plenty of open seats left when we called and they said it was a 50/50 chance. Well what are the odds of them splitting a family. All they said was if we put the infant with one adult. Well no duh. Of course our son had to be with one adult. I can’t inagine why they would split him up too. And he was a lap seat. So he wouldn’t be needing to split up. Allegiant Air customer service was not helpful or great but of course we had to pay to get our seat changed knowing there’s other seats available.

2018-10-27,1,10,"""never fly Allegiant again""",S Corsale,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was on flight 2138 yesterday with ""nonstop service"" from Orlando Sanford to Concord NC. Our flight was initially delayed for ""mechanical issues"". We boarded, were then deplaned (still in Sanford) and loaded up onto another plane. When we descended into Concord, our pilot had to pull up abruptly two times because of missed approaches. This scared many people on the plane, but that's not the worst part. Many people on the plane had family members on the ground who were waiting for their arrival. We were told since our pilot couldn't land us, Allegiant instructed him to return to Sanford. Everyone was disappointed by that decision, considering there were dozens of closer airports to divert to. On our way back to Sanford, we were told we would stop in Savannah to refuel. While we were stretching our legs on the jet bridge, we were told we would attempt Concord again. A few moments later, we were told the jetbridge hit the door of the plane and we would be grounded until further notice. Remember those people sitting at the airport in Concord waiting for their loved ones? At this point, most of them finally had a chance to talk to their loved ones. While they were at the airport, Allegiant refused to give them any answers about what happened to the plane and why it didn't land. They hid from the terrified people who wondered why their loved ones' plane didn't land. When I finally called my mother from Savannah, she was hysterically crying and told me that her and three other people stood outside in the 46 degree rain to watch for the plane at the fence, when Allegiant couldn't give them any answers as to where it was. Was Allegiant scared to hint that their pilot was incompetent because other planes were landing safely at that time? Whatever it is, it's not fair what they put the people on the ground through yesterday. My flight was supposed to arrive at 2:29 PM and finally got in around 12:30 midnight. 10 hours late. The flight attendants did their best to accommodate passengers, however we were told we were only allowed one free snack and drink & the FA's were too flustered to accept payments. Many people missed lunch and dinner during this ordeal, including children, and the least Allegiant could do is offer up snacks to these people who were unable to eat meals. One flight attendant stood out from the rest and we could really tell she had the best intentions for everyone on that plane. She did the best she could to keep everyone comfortable, while still trying to follow Allegiant's stingy orders. All in all, this was my first flight experience with Allegiant. As a fairly frequent flyer with other airlines, I opted for Allegiant because the airport is small, convenient and only 5 minutes from my house. I understand that mechanical problems happen. I even get that the pilot didn't feel comfortable with landing the plane (maybe he needs to be trained better). What I can't forgive is the terrible communication from Allegiant to our loved ones on the ground and the bad call to ""send us back to Sanford"", where I'm sure you would have deplaned us & cancelled the flight, leaving us stranded. I literally could have driven from Orlando to Concord NC faster and made it there safer than I felt on your plane.

It worked out great that my husband was seated near the kids and I got a break by sitting across the aisle or, even better, two rows behind on the flight back! I thought the seats were the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and I've been flying for almost 50 years, both domestic and internationally.

The fare price was great but other than that there was not much good. When I arrived at the airport about 90 before the flight I received a text that my 12:44 pm flight was going to be delayed to 2:55 pm. Not a big deal but when I checked the board in the airport it still showed everything on time. I also got an email at this time with a $50 travel voucher from the airline. So I called home to let my wife know and told her to watch the flight so she could pick me up at the airport. At 1:41pm I got another text pushing the flight to 5:34 pm. Again, no update on the airport boards and apparently not on the internet either as my wife called when she was at the airport to pick me up and I answered the phone, still in Nashville! At around 4 pm someone with some customer service savvy brought pizza to the gate for everyone waiting. While all of this was going on the info board at the gate was out of service and there were no announcements from the gate agents who were sitting around in the wheel chairs at the gate. Finally, at around 5 pm we boarded the flight. Once loaded, the flight attendants and gate agents came through the plane at least 7 times by could not agree on a passenger count. I know this was the issue because I was sitting near the front and could hear everyone trying to blame each other for the issue. We sat on the plane until a little after 7 pm at the gate waiting for fuel and a good head count. We arrived in St. Pete at 9:36pm 9 hours late when I received a final text saying the flight was going to be delayed until 7 pm. At no time was an announcement made on board letting the passengers know what time we would be landing so we could notify people at the destination. The gate agents were nice but not communicative enough. When asked what the delay was I was told that a ""Rescue"" plane was being sent. That was alarming considering Allegiant's maintenance history. The plane was nice and I am sure that they have the widest aisles in the industry because I am also sure that the seats are the narrowest. I paid extra for more leg room but if the seat I got had more leg room I could not find it. Overall a horrible experience.

However, my flight change states that I have a zero charge, not to mention that I have Flex Trip and nowhere in their policy does it state that I have to pay again for my seat. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she refused. Stating a supervisor cannot help me. In summary, they don't have enough agents to answer the phones, they remind you of how you can go to their online portal to make changes yet the price they quote on the portal is higher than the price given by the agent, they do not honor their policy when purchasing flex trip and they refuse to provide you with a supervisor.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Concord to Punta Gorda', 'Date Flown': 'August 2018', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I have flown Allegiant for a few years because their airport in Concord is much closer (ten minutes) to my daughter's family than the Charlotte airport (forty minutes). But I have never enjoyed it mainly because one is never sure if the flight will happen. But this last trip took the cake and apart from returning home on my existing ticket, I will never, ever fly Allegiant again. I was accompanying my two grandsons, (11 and 14) back to their home on a 3:59 p.m. flight, arrival around 6:00 p.m. on July 13. Around 2:00 I got a text that flight delayed until 5:00, arrival 7:00. The problem was the plane coming to Fort Lauderdale (FTL) had equipment problems. The fact that the waiting area was clogged with folks on an earlier (10:30) flight one lady said, was a bad sign. Then we got an announcement they were sending a ""rescue plane"", yay, but it was smaller and they needed 4 volunteers and we had to get new seat assignments. Finally we boarded at 5:30 and left, only to land at Sanford, normally a half hour flight, an hour later where we deplaned. We left Sanford on yet another third plane with the same crew. The pilot apologized for the lack of info but said on the prior flight they had lost navigation and instrumentation and so had ""been pretty busy"". Thank God he and his co. had known what they were doing. The crew came through with the cart and I asked if they really meant to charge for beverages under the circumstances. I got three bottles of water for the boys and for me. We finally touched down at 10:30 p.m. The boys were exhausted. Their parents had tried to call customer service and were told there was a ""356 minute wait for an agent""! This morning I got an email with a lousy $50 voucher; I wonder if I could use it for drinks and snacks on the way home, since I will never fly Allegiant again. By the way the agents in FTL were wonderful and patient and tried their best under terrible circumstances. I don't think this airline deserves them. The upshot is that I have never flown an airline where so many of the delays were caused by equipment failures, as opposed to weather issues.

Trip Experiences: We have flown from Memphis to Orlando on two separate occasions. Seat comfort: Seats are molded plastic with basic pad covering. Seats have no reclining feature, which is uncomfortable on flights over two hours. Flight attendants were generally agreeable, Bag check in lines were long, with a single attendant. Modification of existing reservations: I was unable to modify an existing reservation online. As a result, I placed a call to the call center. It took 1 hour, 23 minutes before I was connected to a call agent. Because of the type of ticket purchased (""standard ticket""), there are ""stiff penalties"" to make changes. Those penalties are $75 per person, per flight. All the call agent could offer was to waive half of the $300 cancellation fees (total of $150) and my pre-booked bag fee, but would not waive the other half. I was informed it would not be ""fair"" to the other passengers who paid for the flexible type reservation. Our request to change dates was made 11 days after the original reservations were placed and 2 weeks prior to our trip. Allegiant Airlines will be able to sell the seats we are unable to use and keep all proceeds from the sale of those seats. After adding the penalties for reservation changes to the original ticket prices, we could have flown on a first class carrier for less. Caution to Allegiant fliers, be aware of cancellation/modification penalties when booking your flights.

2018-07-07,1,10,"""Don't say I didn't warn you""",Noel Iverson,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Fargo. I will never fly with Allegiant Air again. The way this airline does business is deceiving and they knowingly try to take advantage over their customers with add on nickle and dime fees, and poor customer service. I booked my flight for me and my family 2 months in advance. At that time we had 1 checked bag and 1 overhead carry on. We ended up needing 2 checked bags and no longer had use for the 1 overhead carry on. I tried to remove this carry on via their website and app but they don't allow you to do it. You can add bags no problem, but if you want to remove a bag they literally will not let you! I asked the customer service agent at the airport if they could remove the $43.00 bag charge as they could plainly see we did not have an overhead carry on with us. They told me no. I had to call their 1-800 number in order to get reimbursed.  On our way back home I actually asked another customer service agent again if they could help be take off the bag and they told me the same thing: call the 1-800 number. The flight was actually pleasant and the everyone was friendly on-board. A few hours after I got home from the return flight I called the 1-800 number. I was literally on hold for 1 hr and 25 minutes. I finally spoke with Kelly and told her what happened. She placed me on a brief hold and this is what she came back with: ""after speaking with my manager we can offer you a $43.00 voucher."" I told her I did not want a voucher for a bag I never brought on your airplane after notifying both customer service people at the airports. Her response was: ""since the customer service agent at the airport didn't make a notation on the computer system we can only offer you the voucher"". I told her my situation again, assuring her I did not bring on the overhead bag and that I notified both customer service people at the airport that I was not bringing a carry on bag onto the airplane. You would think the right thing to do would be to refund me $43.00 to keep the customer happy and move on? Do they think I'm lying and trying to sneak on a carry on bag for free to save $43.00 when I spent over $1,200 total on this trip? It makes no sense once so ever. I asked to speak with her manager directly and she would not let me. I asked her if $43.00 was worth losing a family of 4 for life? Her response was: ""Since we do not have proof you didn't bring the bag on the airplane we can only offer you a voucher"" So, because Allegiant makes it impossible to remove a bag once it is added and because you do not have the option to take this bag off either online or at the actual airport before your flight, they basically swindle you into yet another ""hidden charge"". I told her to keep the voucher and that me and my family will never be flying with this joke of an airline ever again. If you book a flight with Allegiant buyer be ware.

First we were all on plane door closed safety speech was given and then they asked us to exit the plane for mechanical issues. They kept us waiting around for 3.5 hours before canceling flight by this time there were no more flights available to get to Ft Lauderdale. The gate agents left because they had no answers and hid, as matter of fact 4 agents quit on the spot. This airline doesn't give hotel and ground transportation vouchers instead they give you an Amex rewards card that is supposed to have $300 on the card, but of course mine had zero. So I had to pay for Uber and Hotel out of my pocket. Now onto the next morning for my rescheduled flight at 8:00 AM out of CVG to Ft Lauderdale. I get to the gate at 7:10 the monitor says on time and boarding to begin in 10 minutes, problem no plane. Then at 8:00 AM gate agent tells us flight delayed mechanical issues she will update us every 30 minutes. So I call customer service wait 25 minutes for someone to answer, he tells me they are getting new plane, be taking off at 10:00 AM. Then gate agent tells me new plane has mechanical issues and no time is set for take off. The gate agent then goes and hides and nobody at gate to answer questions. They put out Soda and Ice. Well I spot a stack of meal vouchers and I find the one with my name on it and give to a women who is hungry and she uses the $8.00 voucher for some food. Another woman asks the gate agent who appears after 90 minutes and the agent looks woman in the face and lies, says we have no such vouchers. Well finally at 12:30 flight takes off and we get back to Ft Lauderdale. Where I now have to pay $30 extra for parking and $50 extra for boarding my dog and $250 extra for a Nurses aide to help my mom because I could not be there. Now let's talk about customer service and the $300 I am supposed to have to help offset these extra expenses. I have spoken to 7 or 8 agents, supervisors etc. They tell me it is Amex's fault I don't have the money, please wait 36 hours from time we got card to check for funds, well 36 hours came and went still ZERO on the card. I call Amex as told to do by customer service supervisor and Amex whom I never had a problem with in 33 years of membership and they explain that it is on the airline.

When we left our house(an hour away) the flight was still listed as on time. 15 minutes before arriving to the airport I looked it up and saw it was delayed until 11:20. When we arrived, no Allegiant employees were at the check in counter and we were informed by a skycap that they won’t arrive to answer questions until 2 hours before flight time. So with the delay we had 2 hours to wait until an employee could answer any of our questions. Imagine sitting in an airport with two young children excited to go to the beach. 9:00 rolls around, the employees offer no explanation as to the delay, we check our bags and head to security the TSA agents put my children and grandmother through, and as they were walking through the metal detectors an agent mentioned that since their flight was delayed to 11:45 (mind you the last update we received and was posted was 11:20) they may not get to take off by midnight and if they can’t be in the air by midnight the flight would be cancelled. So I’ve sat right outside of security since 9PM (now 11:33 and the incoming is just landing) waiting to hear if the flight will take off. Only problem is? There are no longer any TSA agents at security, and all of Allegiant employees have left for the day. How am I supposed to feel safe knowing my children and grandmother are on this flight? Especially when no employees are here to answer any questions or offer any explanations to delays.

I was more than willing to pay $25 for this “upgrade”. So I selected my new seat, but there was an issue with the check out process (not sure what). I tried again, I tried a third time with a different card (perhaps they didn’t like that I used my Delta Airlines Amex to pay for my upgrade). Still can’t check-in, I switched to my laptop and tried a fourth time, now the website said “you’ve tried checking-in and we can’t process this”. What!

Flight home was delayed 3 hours and then to top it off we had to switch planes due to a safety issue with the first. No amount of money saved will ever make this experience worth it.

All they told me was it was going to be delayed for a few minutes due to maintenance. After a few minutes then delayed again and delayed again. They never said the main reason. I felt like they were giving excuses after excuses. They did give me two food vouchers and a $100 voucher for my next flight. Which I don't think it's enough for what this Airline took away from me that day. I had reservations at a certain times, I could have gone to work and I missed a whole days of work. I had plans and Allegiant ruined it all. And the flight returning back home was 2 hours delayed, not too bad, if i compare it to my 10 hour delayed from days prior, but still delayed.

The first time I flew with them from Hilton Head to Columbus, they accidentally sent my belongings to Seattle. I understand mistakes happen but they didn’t reimburse me for the items I had to go re-purchase nor offer any kind of apology or incentive. Another incident, my husband and I got married in Hilton Head last year and my aunt and uncle and 2 friends were on the same flight from Columbus to Hilton Head and their flight was continuously getting delayed all day and then canceled due to technical difficulties. They were told that they would fly in a separate plane and leave the next day. The flight was then delayed again all day and they finally left that evening. They had missed 2 whole days of their vacation and Allegiant offered to pay for those 2 days they missed at their condo however, when it came down to it, my aunt kept reaching out and never heard back to get reimbursed. My most recent flight with them from Fort Lauderdale to Columbus was my final straw with the airline. We were heading back home after a cruise and our flight was scheduled for 3.20pm. We had to be off the cruise ship by 8.15 so we got to the airport fairly early. We were expecting to be able to check in and get through security to be able to eat breakfast and lunch to occupy our time. They wouldn’t let us check in until 12.51pm because we were checking bags. So we sat at the airport with 7 of us and all of our luggage for 5 hours with no access to food or shops with snacks, etc. The girls at the check in desk didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or explain why they wouldn’t let us back. Instead, they chuckled. We then finally got to check in and our flight was delayed twice with no explanation. Finally, we get on the plane and sat for an hour and a half before taking off. The whole time we sat there, there was a continuous loud beeping noise the whole hour and a half sitting waiting to take off.

The third notification of delay came at 5:04pm saying that the flight was delayed until 11:45pm. The fourth notification of delay came at 7:57pm saying that the flight was delayed until 12:45am. The aircraft did not arrive in PIE until 2:00am. The flight did not leave until about 3:00am on March 17th, 2018. We finally arrived at IND around 5:00am, but could not get off the plane until 5:30am because the crew at IND was not ready for us. We arrived 11 hours late. The crew at PIE said they were giving out meal vouchers to everyone on the plane, which is fine except the only thing available to eat at PIE includes: a small coffee shop, a limited bar, and a gift shop, which all closed around 8pm. Realizing their mistake, the crew at PIE orders pizza for the passengers. They did not account for people which dietary restrictions, like myself. I could not eat the pizza, otherwise I would get severely sick. So I sat in the PIE airport/airplane for about 11 hours, only having water. I was physically ill once I arrived in IND because I had no access to food for such a long period of time. I would've purchased some snacks on the plane, except the flight attendants did not serve everyone. I was one of those individuals that was not served. One would think that after 11 hours of delay, someone, just one person, would show some kind of customer service, but nope. I did not eat for 12.5 hours that day, because I did not have access to food, even on the airplane. One might ask, ""Why didn't you just leave the airport and go buy something at a restaurant?"" and then answer is ""because we physically could not leave."" TSA closed around 12:30am. Nobody could leave or enter the airport. Nobody. We were legitimately trapped inside the gate area. The option to cancel my flight or reschedule the flight was given. Except once you cancelled or rescheduled your flight, you couldn't leave the airport. You were still trapped inside the airport with those waiting for the aircraft to arrive. I was faced with two options in reality: 1) Wait for the plane to finally show up at 2am, with the possibility of it being cancelled (as explained in the next paragraph), or 2) Cancel/Reschedule my flight, but not being able to leave the airport until TSA opened the next morning so that they can open the exit doors. That would have left me in the airport, which i was told, until 5am. Physically being trapped in the airport, I decided to stick it out because at least I would be out of PIE by 5am. There was very little communication from anyone from Allegiant. I called customer service on 3/16/18 to ask why the flight was so delayed and what they were going to do for us, the passengers. After 58 minutes of being on hold, the agent raised her voice at me 3 times.  She said something along the lines of ""if the plane arrives at PIE at around midnight, they could cancel the flight.""

It seems that this airline is run by animals. Every single time I fly with them (forced to fly with this airline as they are the only direct route from South Florida to Asheville) the flight is delayed. This airline gives no heads up during delays, no emails, nothing. It’s particularly upsetting because it seems they have plenty of notice that the incoming flight is delayed, so they should know and have the respect of letting their customers know when they do. This organization lacks class, humanity, respect and culture. I could give a million examples, but I won’t waste any more of my time. The way I see it, you’re better off taking another airline with a connection, because that would most likely leave on time and get you there at the same time Allegiant will, with their massive delays.

Sure, no problem, Canada customs agent assured us that airlines deliver lost luggage all the time and no problem crossing the border. By Sunday, no bags and started rollercoaster communications with Allegiant and finally was informed that bag was sent via FedEx and was given a tracking number. Great, now we could watch its travels. Tuesday it was resting in Toronto waiting for release from customs. Now began ommunications with FedEx and end result was that we would have to personally arrange customs clearance. Went down to Niagara Falls with documents and was advised that they couldn't do the release there and would have to go to Canada customs at Toronto airport. Called customs in Toronto and very nice man confirmed that was true. Back with FedEx to see if we could arrange a one time power of attorney - nope. So today we did the 120 mile round trip, waved to all the passing cars on the QEW, hwys. 407, 401 and others, toured Toronto airport, became expert at using gps and now arrived home with missing bag.

Once boarded our flight 1812 we were met with mechanical issues. We were left sitting on the Tarmac for a while before they started de-boarding. Once inside we had to wait for further updates. Once they finally updated us they offered free pop and water. The  pilot was speaking to a passenger as she was exiting the airport, explaining she left her number and was going to the hotel. This was after 2 hours of sitting in the boarding area. Maybe an hour after the pilot left they finally made an announcement saying that we will be delayed until 9PM! At first they said no one could leave and return because TSA would be leaving. When asked if they could at least give the smokers a designated area on the Tarmac they hadn't even considered we have been at the airport since 12PM and would be landing in Las Vegas if your planes were taken care of and were reliable. Regular maintenance and planes on standby for these situations is part of the customer experience. They finally offered a 8$ voucher for Scotty Browns Social House where the going rate for anything is 15$ - some people had children and once at the restaurant I heard an older couple talking about their finances and ultimately went the entire day without food. When another plane arrived coming from Las Vegas the seating was different and those who paid for select seating we're told to expect a refund as we were now sitting in cramped conditions on hard flight chairs next to strangers. Even though they sat my friend alone where one of us could have sat with her and when asked if one of us could move to the empty chair they told us no. Once boarded it still took us an hour to get moving, making our departure for 10:30PM meaning we won't arrive in Las Vegas until well into 12:00 AM. They didn't even offer free snacks and beverages aboard your plane. We were told we would receive a $50 voucher towards our next flight and a refund on assigned seating on December 17th and it is currently December 21st and have yet to receive any further correspondence.

We were scheduled to arrive at 5.09 pm and had dinner reservations for 8.30 pm. Our flight boarded a little late and we then sat on the plane for an hour and a half with little communication for the delay, until we had been sitting in the cabin for well over an hour. A part on the plane had been identified as bad, and had to be repaired or replaced. Approaching an hour and 45 minutes we were told to deplane. We sat in the lobby and were told there was no way to tell if we were still flying our that night, as no replacement plane was available. After persistent questioning from dozens of passengers we were told they were trying to repair the plane we originally were assigned. The staff at the ticket counter claimed they had no knowledge of anything else, or any plans Allegiant had for us. Another few hours passed. We then learned that Allegiant could not fly our after 10.00 pm. Some passengers left to rent cars and drive the 9 hour trip to Asheville, where it had just started snowing. One lady was scheduled for urgent medical treatment the next morning. Approaching 9.00 pm the staff gave us $8 in food vouchers for the food court and then announced we would be boarding another airplane in about 15 minutes. The food court was rushed and the staff were overwhelmed with orders while we began boarding the plane. The flight attendants knew nothing about the airplane, read instructions from a tablet and asked the pilot if they had to announce the instructions for a water landing since we were flying over land! They had to try the light switches on the light panel as they were unfamiliar with the plane and did not know where the floatation devices were located (the seats were marked that the floatation devices were under the seats, think about the safety ramifications of that). We heard these conversations from the second row. Enroute, the attendants on the flight told us they would provide us free water and soft drinks for our inconvenience. We finally arrived in Asheville close to 11.00 pm, and missed our honeymoon dinner. We got to bed at 2.00 am. We flew back to St. Pete on November 5th on the return Allegiant trip. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8.00 am. We boarded an hour late due to another mechanical issue, this time necessitating an oil change for a generator with a temperature gauge issue. We finally took off after 10.00 am with a mechanic flying in the cockpit to monitor the situation. In talking with frequent Allegiant fliers this happens all the time. So if you want to arrive on time, choose a different airline. P.S. We lost a half day of our honeymoon and a several hundred dollar dinner.

Then I stopped at the baggage area when we finally landed in Ohio again to check on our luggage and found out that they logged our baggage as found in Denver on 8/18 and no attempt was made to contact us at all. We wasted $200 on clothes and supplies in vegas that shouldn't have been. I still haven't gotten refunded for my leg space seats or luggage checked fees for both travel there and back or any communication about when I will be getting it. Instead I get requests for reviews and deals for our next flight. I will never fly this airline again. They don't even have a scanning system for their bags checked. You get what you paid for when buying a cheap flight through an airline with nobody knowing who they are but lesson learned. Do not fly them ever! Save the stress.

I left the gate and immediately went to baggage claim and double checked with the Allegiant that I was waiting in the right spot. It took a minute for me to get their attention because the employees were in mid conversation with each other. I waited for about an hour and a half and began to get worried because that's a long time to be waiting for a bag. So at around midnight I went to the Allegiant help desk but there was no one there. I was able to chase down one of the employees as they were leaving to go home I imagine and she was very short and irritated that I was asking about my bag. I have flown a lot and I've never had to wait for a bag for so long so naturally I was worried. One of the other employees was walking by with my bag headed towards the desk so I went and claimed it and asked her where it was. She also was very irritated and said ""I pulled it off the carousel"" and walked away. The staff were very rude, the seats were extremely cramped, and waiting for a bag for an hour and a half is ridiculous.

Allegiant Air's website stated the flight departed at 12.00 noon, and arrived at 3.45pm. The stewardess stated we would receive vouchers from Allegiant Air, which I did tonight. They are for $50, are valid only for a future flight on Allegiant Air, and must be redeemed within 1 year. They are the only airline that flies that route - a 1 hour 40 minute flight, and would not have another flight for three more days. Their required policy submitted to the FAA states that they do not compensate excessive delays, which does seem to comply with Federal regulations. They classify delays resulting from mechanical problems as ""a delay resulting from situations beyond their control"" such as would be severe weather, control tower equipment problems, etc. My previous experiences with Allegiant Air had delays of usually about 1 hour, but the savings seemed to justify those delays.

They have never been on an airplane before, but they are 18 yrs old and 11 yrs old so I thought everything would be just fine. They arrived at the LAX airport 2.5 hours early and checked in just fine, I received an email stating they checked in, bags were checked in. I guess they got held up in security, when they got to the front of the security line they told them they had 13 minutes to get to their flight. After they were done being searched they had 3 minutes to get to the flight. They asked the TSA staff where the gate was and he told these boys to go to the gate in the opposite direction, so they missed the flight. They  did not have a phone and had to borrow a phone to try to find someone to drive 3 hours back to get them. How do you check in 2 boys and not make sure they are on the plane?

Like other reviews we were told we will give updates every 30 minutes, we are getting you another flight, etc. At 11:30 pm we were finally told the truth, our flight was canceled.

I have airways looked past the constant delays and maintenance issues with their aircraft's because the price was so low. However, this will be my last time flying with Allegiant. I was just charged $50 at the gate for a carry on bag. This is for the same little backpack that fits under the seat with plenty of room that I have taken on every single flight with them. I have never been charged for it. If an airline is going to have different policies at different airports they need to notify customers of that. The people sitting next to me have larger bags by their feet and were not charged.  I've witnessed Allegiant employees being rude before and the unprofessionalism of some of the flight attendants is unbelievable. But the way I was just treated in Indianapolis is unacceptable.

2017-07-05,10,10,"""I would fly Allegiant again""",J Johnson,"✅ Verified Review |  Fort Walton Beach to Cleveland return, which apparently is only a seasonal route. The airline offers a no-frills service. When you buy your ticket you get a seat at a very reasonable fee. If you need more space you have the option to buy more at that time for a fee. If you decide later to bring more luggage, that decision will cost you a few dollars more. When you purchase your ticket, the airline will assign a seat at check in. If you need to have a specific seat, you can purchase that seat for a fee. The airline boards in about 6 or 7 zones, based on seat assignments. If you are the kind of person who likes to get on early, you can pay for that as well. Lastly, tickets are non refundable, and allow for no changes.  So, if you think there is a pretty chance you will need to change you ticket, you had better buy the option to change it for a small fee. The planes I flew were A320s, which seat about 177, no seat back pockets and seats are fixed in place and do not recline. You get no free snacks or beverages, you can use major credit card to purchase snacks and beverages. So that is Allegiant Air in a nutshell. If you can deal with that, it is a great value. My flights were on time, actually one arrived early, and the staff was polite and professional. The airline starts boarding about 45 minutes before scheduled departure, so arrive early; because they do close the door 15 minutes before departure and you ain't getting on.

And the airline cancelled the the return flight and we all 3 got stuck. And they didn't even have the courtesy to call us or anything. They just sent an email that your flight has been cancelled sorry. We had work the next day and we got to know about our flight cancellations a night before our flight. We all had to call in sick at our work and lost so much money. On top of that they had no other flight that day and not even the next day from Vegas. I mean they had no flight until 2nd of July (no flight for next 4 days). We felt like we are stuck here forever. We made a huge mistake by booking this airline. They gave us $150 compensation when we book flight from them next time. I mean this is not what we want. And I called their customer service the lady was so rude on the phone, I asked her to book another flight for us as it's not our fault that your airline doesn't have flight for next 4 days. She said sorry I can't do anything, you have to book it yourself. And the flight from same day was so expensive that we couldn't afford it (it's was more than 1500 dollars for 3 of us). We were so stressed out and our trip turned into a worst nightmare because of this airline. Then I called this airline customer service again and asked her which one is the closest city where we can take flight for next day. Then she told me there's one flight from Mesa, Arizona next day in the evening. So we told her to book that as we had no other option. We paid for hotels for one more day which cost us $450 dollars because we booked it on spot same day and then we booked a car which was $580 dollars plus fuel that costed us $100 dollars. My boyfriend drove us from Vegas to Mesa-Phoenix airport which was 5 hour drive. It was so stressful and depressing experience for us. We had to go through a lot on this trip.

There was no mention by Allegiant, warning passengers that the airline was now flying out of the 'South Terminal'. The terminal was a long drive from the main terminal, and anyone not arriving in plenty of time could have easily missed the shuttle from the main terminal to the 'south 40' where Allegiant now departs and arrives. This terminal is primitive at best. There are no jetways; you walk out on the tarmac to the aircraft, then climb a long set of incline ramps to get into the plane. Not fun in Texas 90-100 degree heat; I can only imagine what that would be like in a rainstorm! Any passenger flying Allegiant out of Austin should be warned in advance via your website, email or text message that the airline is now using a remote terminal with very limited facilities. I have taken three flights on Allegiant. On all three flights, the seats do not recline. They barely have padding. Allegiant should warn their potential passengers that their aircraft lack even the most minimum comforts. There is no free beverage service; not even a glass of water.

Some people had to rebook flights as they were connecting out of Vegas and were missing those connections. Well, we figured this could happen to any airline. However, on the way back the exact same thing happened! That was preceded by an announced gate change from Gate B-6 to Gate A-16, except there is no gate A-16 and we were left to scramble with other passengers trying to figure out where in the heck we were supposed to be, although our electronic boarding passes did eventually get properly updated. That was the third gate change they announced for different flights in the three hours we waited. I've never experienced that with any other airline. When it was time to board, the loud speaker did not work so those of us who paid for priority boarding heard nothing unless you were standing next to the guy speaking. And boarding was a full hour before the flight was supposed to be able to take off. Without word-of-mouth few priority boarders would have made it. But there was no rush because we were delayed once again due to ""computer malfunction"" and another reinspection checklist. We sat on the tarmac for an hour and 40 minutes. Once the plane started it was very slow getting moving, we lost the A/C - 110 in Vegas! - and the exhaust smell was overwhelming because they left the doors open too long. The upshot was the crew was very pleasant to us but they looked harried and exhausted themselves. I'm sure they must be sick of this as I now know delays are normal with Allegiant. The low price that drew us in was anything but after all the added fees. Our $100 tickets each were $260 each when all was said and done. We won't be flying Allegiant again.

When we got back inside, we had to wait another couple of hours for maintenance to arrive, and thank goodness the problem was fixed and we finally made it to Myrtle Beach after being at the airport all day, 7 hours after scheduled flight time. I will say though, once we were in the air, there were no problems. The return flight was on schedule with no problems. I will not fly Allegiant again.

We booked a trip with Allegiant to fly from Ogdensburg NY (near our home town of Ottawa, Ontario) to Orlando but it's actually Sanford which is about 45 minutes from the Orlando International Airport and north of the city. Our departure flight was late due to heavy air traffic in the Orlando area; delay of 90 minutes. There is no car rental agency at all in Ogdensburg, so if you happen to get stuck there, you're out of luck! On June 10, we arrived back at the Sanford Airport, having dropped off our rental, and entered Terminal B to check in for our return flight on June 11. It was a clear day. We were greeted by an airport person that advised up before even entering the check-in line that our flight had been cancelled, and we would need to go to Terminal A (?). Once we walked all the way over there, we were in a line with all the other passengers from the flight. Two employees were at the counter. It took us over an hour to reach the front only to be told the flight was not rescheduled and we could fly home on Wednesday! No offers of anything other than a voucher to fly again with Allegiant for the missed flight; not the total. All this resulted in us having to book another car; drive to Orlando; book a JetBlue flight at $1000 to Syracuse; rent another car in Syracuse; drive to Ogdensburg to pick up our car, then back to Watertown to drop off the 3rd rental of that day and drive home; arriving in Ottawa at 6:00 a.m. the following day! With flights and cars, the added cost was $1500! So much for a $69 airfare to Sanford! I could have flown business class from Ottawa on a major airline for less than it ended up costing us to fly Allegiant. I have tried several times to call the number listed on a slip of paper the airport employee handed us after our hour-long wait. I would caution anyone this is even remotely thinking of traveling with this airline to think twice. a major airline, you would be flying into and out of major airports where other airlines would be available, and partner airlines possibly available to help you get home. With Allegiant, they fly into 'fringe' airports that only cater to just them or them and a few other charter airlines (as in Sanford).

The flight from Santa Rosa, CA to Las Vegas (flight 569 from Santa Rosa to Las Vegas) seemed to be very convenient. No need to drive to San Francisco, inexpensive. We arranged everything: we booked a round trip flight with Allegiant, a car rental From Las Vegas airport, a week stay at the hotel in Flagstaff, some prepaid excursions. So we were waiting for boarding at the airport, hearing that the boarding starts in a few minutes again and again. Then we got a message that the flight was delayed for an hour. About an hour later, it was announced that the flight was canceled (without rebooking) for technical reason. We were not offered any option to have our flight rebooked with Allegiant or any other airline even we were ready to fly from any another other (San Francisco or Oakland) Bay Area airport. We have so many things scheduled (and paid for) already. We were told: ""go to SFO or OAK and try to book another flight by yourself"". We only got two $150 vouchers that we could use with Allegiant Air. Those vouchers are worthless since we are not going to fly with this airline. Never again! Money paid for the reservation for the roundtrip with the airline is supposed to be refunded (including car rental). At least Allegiant Air customer service representative told us so. It is still too early to confirm if we get all the money we paid during our booking with Allegiant. It may take a few day to confirm if we got our money back. But what about all other expenses? A week worth of taken vacation time, the hotel reservation that was too late to cancel, pre-booked excursions. I am not even talking about small things like driving to airport, paying for parking. Any normal airline would at least pay cash for ""inconvenience"" and would rebook a flight with another airline, pay for the hotel. As I said earlier we would be OK with driving to San Francisco or Oakland and fly from there. No company have the right to treat its customers like this.

The only difference was the speech for your credit card was half as long. Again, no greeting boarding or exiting the plane. I understand its a low cost flight but they charge for everything. The check in of $40 is crazy. We paid the $15 to carry a bag on and was limited to bag and my purse. Then you play for your seat, again I get it because that's how you keep costs down. But, to pay $10 for a boarding pass its a bit excessive. I printed from home and luckily the hotel allowed us or we would have been screwed to pay more. No coffee on the plane.

She then tossed my sweater at me which I had left back in my original seat. This was a very disheartening and disappointing experience to say the least.

Received no explanation as to why it was cancelled and an alternate flight was not offered. They did refund our money but we lost a lot of money and time on previously booked excursions and meals. Not to mention my husbands birthday was ruined! They did also give us a voucher towards another flight, which we reluctantly used this past weekend. This past Friday March, 31, 2017, we were to fly out of Wilkes-Barre to St. Petersburg. Our flight was delayed by over 2 hours. Once finally on the plane we were stopped on the runway due to a mechanical issue with fear that we would not even be able to take off. Nearly 2 and a half hours past initial departure time we were finally cleared after they got the mechanical issue fixed. Now to think we are on a plane for the next 2 hours, a plane that just had an issue and couldn't take off. Once in flight, the pilot came over the speaker to tell everyone he apologized for the inconveniences and that the flight was almost cancelled as there was no pilot to fly the plane. Said he came in on his day off to fly it. The plane was dirty and had a terrible odor on it. Was afraid to touch anything. The bathroom was just disgusting. Smelt horrible and had mold near and around the sink and toilet. The only thing Allegiant had going for them was the staff. They were all friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this company to anyone!

The handling of the vouchers was a mess, there were 4 Allegiant staff members behind the counter - 1 of which was sitting down eating pizza. Instead of working efficiently by dividing up the stack of vouchers amongst them, they had 1 person call out names 1 by 1 of every individual on the plane while the other staff members just watched. In general, the staff lacked professionalism, compassion, and competency. To make matters worse, there was only 1 taxi that would accept the voucher. When I notified the Allegiant staff, I was told with a condescending tone that I could just walk to the hotel if I did not feel like waiting. At this time it was 1.30am and 34 degrees outside.

They told us to go out and buy what we needed and they would reimburse us. Obviously we were skeptical, especially as the days went on without us getting our bags or car seats.

It was then learned amongst the passengers in the room that this ""manager"" had called several of the passengers of the plane and informed them of the delay and then we had an extended wait time because those passengers hadn't arrived yet. Once on the airplane we had a horrible ascent, and descent. Once we arrived at our destination, we arrived 3 hours passed our schedule arrival time.

Our flight attendant was more than rude and unprofessional. We were seated in the first row on the plane. We had bought our 15 month old her own seat so my husband, our daughter and myself had our own space. Our daughter was having trouble adapting to a confined space and was having a meltdown. My husband and I were trying everything we could to help soothe her during our initial taxi. The FA was on a huge power trip. Traveling with a toddler is stressful and not pleasant for anyone. She was lecturing us and talking down to us the entire flight was unnecessary and in poor taste. I was on the verge of tears by the time we landed because she wouldn't stop meddling in our situation. On our way home, we flew from Las Vegas to Rapid City, SD on 12/27. The universe must've been working against us since the same FA was on our return flight. This time my husband was seated in the exit row and my daughter and I were seated catty-corner behind him to his left. During initial prep, the FA had asked the exit row customers the routine ""incase of an emergency"" questions. My husband answered yes, he was willing and able. Half way through our flight my husband and I had traded spots as we switched off entertaining our daughter. One FA stopped at the exit row and told me I would need to pay for the seat if I was going to sit there. I explained to her we had already purchased the seat and were switching for a few minutes. The FA proceeded to make her way back to plane a few minutes after my conversation with the first flight attendant. She told me I wasn't allowed to sit there as she didn't initially brief me. I told her I understood and that I would switch seats with my husband. She returned 2 minutes later and had asked me if we had paid for the seat my daughter was sitting in. I said ""yes."" I'm upset because as a lead flight attendant, it's her job to know which seats are vacant and half way through a flight she was questioning us. 3 minutes pass and she approaches my husband who is now back in the exit row. She explains to him that she didn't brief him during the initial briefing and that he would need to be reseated. She also mentioned that if something were to happen during the flight and the FAA were to find out she allowed someone to sit there who wasn't briefed, she would be in a lot of trouble. To me, this all sounds again like her problem and again not knowing which seats are paid for and occupied. My husband said he would be reseated. She then proceeded to tell him that he wasn't allowed to move because the seat belt sign was on. So she briefed him while standing there and asked for a verbal confirmation. She then ended the conversation with ""in the future, don't sit in an exit row."" For the later half of our flight, she 3 times came back to talk to us and made us feel like we were trying to short change the company by stealing seats.

The crew did hand out snacks and juice to drink. They used what they had, and kept their stress under control considering the flack they had to endure. We needed to add fuel, because the captain kept the engines running to maintain our comfort. Our cell phones were receiving updates all evening our flight was resumed the next day. Trust me by the time we got to the hotel Allegiant Air put us up in we managed to only get 3 hrs sleep. But the ground crew returned the next morning to check us in, with less sleep.

She threatened to close the door on me and my family, even though it says they don't close boarding until 15 mins prior to departure. She continued to verbally threaten me for the 5 minutes it took to heat the bottle, which still left us boarding 25 mins prior to departure. Once we boarded the plane, a flight attendant tried to tell us that we couldn't have 2 car seats in the same row on the same side of the aisle, even though regulations say you can as long as the adult sits in the aisle seat. They continued to have us move the car seat 2 more times, once across the aisle and then they decided that wasn't good enough so they asked my husband to take one of the car seats to the back of the plane and seperate our family. At this point they were claiming ""weight distribution"". I demanded to sit with my family, and after further insistence, I and my 2 year old were allowed to go sit with my husband and 11 month old in the back of the plane. On a flight at 7:45am on New Year's Day that was 50% empty. It was clear to me that they were simply trying to relegate us to the back of the aircraft, even though on Allegiant you pay more money for better seats that are more forward in the aircraft.

The flight was pushed back twice and then finally canceled. Everyone was told to go to the desk to get hotel and food vouchers and rearrange flight. The crew could not tell us where we would be staying for the evening, nor when we would be able to fly out, so we weren't comfortable making our own accommodations in the event it was an early morning departure. We waited and we waited at 11 at night with absolutely no information. When one man demanded some information and voiced the ridiculousness of the situation, they called security on him. Then there were so many people being sent to the same hotel, we had to wait over an hour in line for a shuttle. We were told it was just across the street.

Our flight was scheduled as On Time and without delays, but after we boarded we were told to disembark because, according to the flight attendant, the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls wasn't working. We waited in the airport for 1.5 hours before we were told to board the plane again. Everyone boarded and waited on the plane an additional 45 minutes until the pilot said the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls still wasn't working. We disembarked again and this time most of the passengers were anxious for a better explanation. An Alegiant worker finally admitted that the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls hadn't been working for a few days and two Allegiant planes were already stranded in Idaho Falls. Many passengers were frustrated, but all the passengers were told to just leave because no one at the airport could answer any questions. There were people who had to get to work the next day and kids were crying because they couldn't spend Christmas with family that night- including my 10 year-old. What I don't understand is, if the de-icer in Idaho Falls hadn't been working and planes were already stranded there, why weren't we notified before we arrived at the airport? Anyway, I called a number an Allegiant worker had written on a small piece of paper and I waited on hold for over 30 minutes before my wife discovered the number I was given was a generic number. Allegiant couldn't even give me a good number to call, so that I could resolve this issue. After hanging up and calling a different number I was ultimately told the next flight was four days away. I argued for a refund and was given that, including a refund of all the nickel and dime charges Allegiant gets you with (at least the refund was a plus).

One hour in the air versus one day of driving saves me one day of PTO, or a vacation one day longer. I'm a very frequent flier on several airlines, and the value for money with Allegiant is excellent. I prefer a la carte pricing. Since I'm normally carry-on-only, I don't want to pay for someone else's checked luggage, but I'm more than happy to pay a little extra for legroom and priority boarding - both of which were well worth the money. I skipped to the front of the line while checking my bag (the $6 I paid for priority boarding includes priority check-in / bag check), and had enormous legroom in my seat. Frequent flier hack: I found that I could get a cheaper international ticket on a mainline airline out of Washington DC than I could via anywhere in Ohio so I took Allegiant to BWI, then continued on from there to England.

The weight limit for suitcases was less than other airlines at only 40 pounds and you need to indicate in advance how much checked and carry on items you are bringing and pay for them. Although I paid for carry on I didn't see anyone checking this. You need to print your boarding pass in advance or they charge you $5 at the airport per person. The flight boarded on time and was turned around quickly. They board from the back forward unless you buy priority boarding. I paid for the premium economy seat and it was comfortable. They don't recline but they start out partially reclined so it was comfortable and there was decent room. It was an older plane retrofitted but I was happy with it. I would recommend this airline and I would fly them again. In Europe many of the discount airlines have similar policies so you need to read the fine print and follow their rules but all in all, a good airline, great to fly direct and great price.

I understand they have a bottom line to protect, but I would rather have an airline be upfront and honest with me. For example, I tried to put my personal item (which was a very full backpack, as I had two laptops in there for a business trip) in an overhead bin. I was one of the last ones on the plane and the flight attendant told me I couldn't put it in there as I didn't pay for the storage space and I had to keep it in front of me.

2016-08-27,1,10,"""smallest seats I have ever seen""",Larry James,"Indianapolis to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. I tried this airline for a week trip to Las Vegas. The price was good so why not. Just as I was ready to leave for the airport a message pops up on my phone that the plane was delayed 3 hours. I was still at home so just sat back down and watched TV. Second, on the way to the airport I got another message that the plane is further delayed another hour. Since I was most of the way there I just went on and waited in the airport. Finally the plane arrived and I was boarded for the 3.5 hour flight to Las Vegas. A big guy came to sit next to me. These seats are the smallest seats I have ever seen on an airplane. He spread out over his seat and 1/3 of mine. I thought I will just recline and sleep on the way to Vegas. Wrong, the seats don't recline. They are mostly hard plastic and not well padded (I could feel the supports in my back). This was the 3.5 hour flight from hell. I didn't look forward to getting on that plane at the end of the week to get back home. If you want to pick your seat you have to pay $24 each way for that. And if you have more than a personal item they charge you another $45 for a carry on and even more for a checked bag. There is no free drink service on these flights. They charge you for everything. I booked my rental car though the airline when I was purchasing my ticket and paid for it with the ticket. When I picked up the car at the rental company they also charged me $51 for something with no explanation. I could have waited and bought the rental at Las Vegas for what I paid the airline and this extra charge. never again. So, here I am at the end of the week ready to fly back home. I'm at the airport waiting 10 minutes before the boarding time when they tell everyone that there is a 90 minute delay due to a crew member that isn't there. About 60 minutes into this delay they finally start boarding and after everyone has boarded we sit there and sit there another 40 minutes. I asked what we were waiting on and was told the flight crew member was still not there. Finally about after another 10 minutes this girl come strolling on the plane as if nothing is wrong. They finally push the plane away and we leave for the uneventful 3.5 hour flight home.",,"{'Aircraft': 'MD80', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'IND to LAS', 'Date Flown': 'August 2016', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

That point was reached on my last round trip with Allegiant Air. The flight was fine. The service was fine. The landing was perfection. The only problem is the seat. The seat was something I've never seen on an airplane until now. It was without any doubt the worst designed, uncomfortable ""seat"" I've ever sat in and I'm not overweight. It consisted of a metal shell wrapped in vinyl with a little over 1 inch of padding. The seat itself was no more than 2 inches thick and it was stationary, i.e. did not recline. Because of the minimal padding and it being a preformed metal shell, the seat did not conform to those ranging in various heights. Someone say 5'7 probably ""fit"" better that someone over 6 feet, etc. The back of the seat had no ""pocket"" to put any of your personal items, like reading glasses or a bottle of water. The arm rest was this tiny little arm about 8 inches in length and an inch in width, essentially a joke. In short, you couldn't design something worse if you tried and there's absolutely no way I could last on a cross country flight being tortured in that seat. You would think seat comfort would still be high on the list when deciding to cut services and charge more for everything (including 5 bucks for a boarding pass) in the airline industry today.

Passengers who did not have the app were confused because the screens at the gate and the mobile app itself did not reflect the delay. There was no Allegiant Air representative at the gate to provide clarification, so after 2:11 came and went, it was obvious that the delay was legit. At 3:30, an Allegiant air rep arrived at the gate and announced that our plane was due to land at 4:30, and that everybody needed to hurry up and board the plane after the passengers were released. At 4:00 the Allegiant attendant announced for everyone to ""be quiet and listen up"" because the plane was going to be a little later because of ""storms"" - and suggested that we look at weather radar to confirm the weather patterns. The plane landed at 5:00, and we were told that they needed to clean the plane before boarding.

A few of us brought it to representatives attention that the posted flight and time for Orlando on the screens were showing that it was departing from our gate, we were told that they didn't have anyone to change the information - so of course people who arrived at the gate after the announcement boarded the plane (oddly, not discovered at the gate by the attendants), and further delayed our take off as they were removed after everyone else was seated. Then at 5:45, the captain apologized for the delay, citing that they had some mechanical problems in Myrtle Beach (weren't the delays caused by ""storms""? The Allegiant rep even emphasized that we validate the presence of storms on the radar, guess that was a little white lie). Then the captain started yapping something about the fact that if we weren't airborne in exactly 15 minutes, the legal flight hours for the pilots would be exceeded and they would have to cancel the flight.

The first time they told us there was no crew and the 2nd the excuse was mechanical issues. In both situations we couldn't leave until the following day. We were given $100 vouchers which sort of traps you into feeling like need to book with them again to use it but it's not worth it. As already mentioned in several reviews the cost incurred from their totally unreliable service generally exceeds the money you think you are saving when you buy their tickets--even with the $100 voucher. We're out over $600 between our hotel room and show tickets for a show we can't attend now because our rescheduled flight the day after we were supposed to leave doesn't take off until 6pm--if it actually ends up leaving at all. It seems to be a real crap shoot. In talking with others at the airport nearly everyone had stories of being burned by flight cancellations. Allegiant has no concern for the fact they are destroying vacation plans that in most cases people have been looking forward to for months.

I was flying to meet my husband in Reno. Our plane was supposed to take of at 6:15. It was 7pm and we hadn't even heard anything yet. When they finally told us something they said our plane was still in Great Falls and should be there in two hours. They gave us all meal vouchers for 8 dollars - everything was closed and seriously 8 dollars? So we waited two hours where they then announced ""The plane still hasn't left due to mechanical issues, we are working very hard to have another plane to get everyone taken care of, please be patient. We have a plan - we just don't know what the plan is yet"". We literally all started laughing. This went on for hours. They would not give us a straight answer on anything. They kept us all there until midnight where they then canceled the flight and said it would fly out the next day but didn't know which time. Also they had already put all our luggage on a broken down plane (why?) so we all had to wait another hour and half to get our check ins off. They offered everyone 300 dollars for a room. No rooms were available at midnight Friday night in Las Vegas. So over 20 people spent the night at the airport.

At 2:00 am on the day of our scheduled departure I received a TXT from Allegiant that our flight for that day as well as our return flight a week later had been cancelled. Checked the website sure enough flight says cancelled. No other information, just cancelled. And they only fly on Mondays and Fridays from TYS to LAS so it's not like we have any alternatives. So immediately I begin to think about all of the other reservations I needed to cancel before I get charged for not showing up. 1st night hotel is prepaid non-refundable: $200 lost, next 2 nights at Zion Lodge already past the cancellation deadline by 1 day - $500 lost, La Jolla I lose the first night deposit $300 lost, luckily can cancel by last night at airport.

2016-07-26,2,10,"""spend that extra money on a good airline""",A Scherff,"Horrible first time experience. Our flight from Las Vegas to Sioux Falls, SD was first delayed Sunday, July 24. We were told that we were waiting on the captain. Then they didn't know where he was. After sitting on the plane for 45 min, we all had to exit because the internal temperature of the plane had risen too much and was not safe, supposedly due to all of the bodies on board. Once off the plane, there were rumors it could take 2 hours or more, or possibly not even until the morning, before we were able to leave. Then it was announced it would take 20 minutes to half hour and it should be cooled off enough for us to safely board. After an hour, we were told we could board again. Once we were on and all seated, they told us 1) Some people didn't come back on, so they had to reevaluate for weight, and 2) There wasn't enough fuel to get us to South Dakota, so we had to go to Mesa, Arizona to fuel up. Once in the air, a loud, piercing shrill started up. Damage your ears loud and high pitched. The entire hour to Mesa, AZ. They announced over the loudspeaker that they knew about the noise and would be looking into it once we landed. Once we started descending, the noise stopped. When we landed, they started handing out small cups of complimentary ice water. We asked if we needed to worry about the internal temperature rising again while we waited, since that was the problem in Vegas. We were told by a stewardess that we ""weren't being held hostage, that we could get off at any time, but they couldn't make any promises that we would be able to get back on."" After a little while, we noticed people taking our baggage off the plane and tossing it onto carts. Turns out we were going to be boarding a different plane anyway, they needed to take ours for a test run to find out the cause of the problem. When we got into the small airport at Mesa, AZ, their little shop with snacks wasn't open. We just assumed it was so they could charge us $3 for M&M's or $5 for a Snack Pack on the flight. Moral of the story, folks, if you want to feel just a little safer while flying and have flight attendants that aren't so rude, don't fly Allegiant. Save up, spend that extra money on a good airline.

Being the responsible adults that we are, we arrived 2 hours early for our 2:15 flight from Vegas to Tulsa. Our flight was delayed at least 4 times (I lost count). We were told that the delays were due to a non-functioning external a/c unit that was supposed to keep the plane cool in-between flights. They told us that it ran for at least an hour before anyone noticed the problem. The plane was sitting in Vegas sunlight in 114 degree weather without a/c. In addition to the delays, we experienced 1 aborted take off (plane had physically left the ground, but pilot had to abort and take us back due to an air speed sensor malfunction) after having set on the tarmac for 1.5 hours without a/c. A second boarding during which we set on the tarmac for 2 hours without a/c. While we were sitting in a sweltering plane some of the passengers voiced their frustration. The pilot then got on the speaker and threatened all passengers with an air marshal if we did not keep our opinions to ourselves. This was after he told us all via the speaker that this was ""just one of those nights."" We started down the runway this time and never even got to attempt take off due to one of the blinds reportedly coming off a window.  We were deplaned a 2nd time and told that our flight was cancelled. The staff waiting at the gate informed us at that point that we passengers should begin looking for our own hotel accommodations. They would not assist us in any fashion. Allegiant Air would reimburse us up to $300 for the hotel, and will reportedly reimburse us for transportation to/from the airport. They estimated that we would get out reimbursement in 5-7 days. Keep in mind that this is Vegas, on a weekend and it was now after 11 p.m. We couldn't find a room under $300, so we are now losing $$ through no fault of our own. I also had to cancel our reservation in Tulsa, which was now outside of the ""no penalty/no charge"" window. I spent a lot of time pleading my case not to be charged for a room that we would now be unable to use. For our troubles, we were given $8 meal vouchers and a $100 credit towards future Allegiant Air flights?! $8 doesn't buy a meal at Vegas airport. And we will not be flying with that airline again - that credit is useless.

This 2 day delay had a devastating ripple effect throughout my entire 7 day itinerary. It seems that this company can’t keep track of its own pilots. Allegiant flew a different plane in to DSM only to find out that the pilots were out of air time. Here is a working airplane, but no one to fly it. What kills me is that the company is military strict on checked baggage weight, but it asks flyers to open the air vents and click the seatbelts before deplaning. I have strict flying rules too. Make me unload 3 lbs. from my checked luggage into my personal carry-on at the check-in stand (on a return trip no less) and you can click your own seatbelts and close window shades behind me.",,"{'Aircraft': 'DC80', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'DSM to PIE', 'Date Flown': 'July 2016', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Ground Service': 2, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The seat was fairly uncomfortable for me, it is the newer style of carbon fiber frame and had very thin seat padding. These seats don’t recline at all, the tray tables are smaller than they used to be and you can’t put anything in the seat back other than papers. You used to be able to put a water bottle or other items in the seat pocket, but no more. This airline charges you for everything, so I’m not sure you are really saving much money on Allegiant. Refreshments cost a minimum of $2 for a can of pop. I normally barely pay that for a 12 pack of pop. Their schedule to Ft Wayne is very limited, making it harder to schedule your stay. And they don’t even fly to Ft Wayne at ALL from 8/13 to 11/15.  Either you are providing service to the city or not. When the pilots gave announcements, we could not hear what he was saying because he talked so softly. I asked the people sitting in my row if they heard what he said, and they could not hear him either. On the return flight, the cabin temperature became very warm inside. I did ask the flight attendant if she could lower the temp, and apparently she did because it became slightly cooler in the cabin. Also on the return flight, after a short while the pilot turned on the seat belt sign and kept it on the entire way back. There were a few bumpy periods during this time, but not the whole way back. He could have turned it off for some of the time so people could move around a bit. I became very antsy in my seat after about 90-120 min of flight.

My boyfriend lives in Florida and I live in Ohio, so the price that Allegiant offers is very competitive compared to other airlines. I've never been thrilled by my flights with Allegiant (inconvenient times, not a lot of flexibility, fees for bags and reservation changes that add up), but it does have its perks (affordable, small airlines so less security hassle, nonstop flights). However, the past couple of flights we have experienced multiple delays. It seems almost as if this is becoming a signature of Allegiant flights. This past flight was already inconveniently timed to fly out at 8pm and arrive at 10pm (this would be fine if there was a choice, but this was the only time available from LCK). That afternoon, the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. Annoying, but no big deal (I should mention that the airport is an hour away from my final destination, so each delay made the drive to Sarasota more and more inconvenient). Once I was at the airport (arrived early at 5:30, figured I could work on homework or read), I received a text message that the flight was delayed until 9:16pm (there was not an announcement at the airport for a while - only text messages at first). Around 9pm, we received another missive that informed us that the flight would leave at 10:56pm. The workers at the airport were not at the gate for most of this, maybe avoiding angry passengers? There were sporadic announcements to the gates. Long story short, we left at 11:30pm and arrived around 1:30am; I arrived in Sarasota around 2:45am, almost 4 hours later than I had planned. Allegiant never explained to us the reason for such a drastic delay (only made worse by the lateness of the original flight). Was it weather? The flight was flying out of Myrtle Beach and into Ohio. Was it computer issues (they seem to encounter these a lot - which only freaks me out more about the safety of the flights)? Something else? The pilot and flight attendants were all very kind on the flight, and all of the passengers were pretty complacent (no annoying irate passengers to deal with - which I appreciated). However, an explanation would have been nice. Maybe even some free food on the flight to make up for the 3 hour delay! I'm not sure if I'll be flying Allegiant again. Probably I will, because I can't afford to fly anyone else. While there are some good things about Allegiant, I still have many major issues with them. I realize that they are a discount airline and therefore the fees and inconvenient times are necessary.

When I called Allegiant, the agent would give no reason for the change. The weather in Asheville, Punta Gorda and between was beautiful; most of the east coast was also nice. I believe that the flight was cancelled because there were not enough seats sold. The fact that the flight was rescheduled for the next day would foul our tight schedule that involved driving to several other locations before returning to Asheville. Besides, what would motivate us to trust that Allegiant would fly on the 7th if they weren’t flying on the 6th? They refunded my fare and car rental charges, the minimum they could do and the most that they would do. The result is that two arthritic seniors drove an extra 1400 miles and an extra 24 hours.

It was apparently was the priority check in line since when I approached the counter I was asked if I was priority check in. I replied no and was informed I had to wait in the long line. I explained I was not checking in, but was there to purchase tickets. She looked at the clock and it was 11:00, so she informed me that she would not sell me a ticket because it was 11:00.

This is the 2nd time I've flown Allegiant. I made my reservations with Allegiant because 1) It was half the price of the major airlines and 2) It was a direct flight from Springfield, Mo to Las Vegas. I paid extra for priority seating and carrying my bag on the plane. I printed my boarding pass off at home and then downloaded the app so I had it in my phone as well. This way I never had to deal with the counter. I always have snacks on me so the fact that you had to pay for Snacks/drinks (water too) didn't bother me. I also didn't think the seats were uncomfortable or there was a leg room issue. If you fly a lot most planes these days have decreased their legroom so for 3 hours it wasn't a big deal. My only ""complaint"" is that departure time seems to be a suggestion. We left about 45 minutes late. The boarding process was slow so be prepared for that. I would suggest paying the $15ish fee and get priority boarding and a seat at the front of the plane. I thought the staff were friendly and I would fly them again.

Both times the flight was cancelled we stood in line for over an hour to receive a $100 voucher for a future flight. Allegiant has no extra planes to send in so you just have to stay overnight and since our flight was supposed to be at 7.15 am that means hanging out at the hotel all day unless you want to pay to rent a car. Allegiant counter staff were fairly rude and matter of fact - the man behind us had a wife graduating from college that night and was going to have to miss it.

In the ensuing 1 hr 45 minute flight back, no other announcement was made, the flight attendants claimed they had no info, and were rude and all but disappeared. Call buttons were going off all over the plane and were being ignored. We departed the plane with no information about rebooking, no representative at the gate, and no information. A baggage handler close by was caught by surprise and tried to find out something, which he finally told those who could hear him that the flight was rebooked for the next morning, there would be no room or food vouchers and everyone was on their own. He was asked to make an announcement so the 150 passengers could all hear, but he would not do that and left everyone confused.

Customer service is like a pick-up team of airline personnel from ticketing to flight crew.  Check-in lines are long because the counter is only open for one hour prior to flight, so everyone is forced to queue at once. Both flights were delayed (one hour and two hours, respectively) for no apparent reason. In the aircraft cabin, the seats are set close together yet the aisle is very wide. The high bag check fees ensure that boarding will be very slow. Promotion doesn't seem to be part of the corporate marketing strategy. There are practically no signs anywhere - at ticket/check-in counter or gates. Pricing is not especially competitive on this route once the add-ons for bag checks and better seats are included.

While it's nice to have a non-stop flight to one of our favorite traveling destinations (Orlando/Disney World), I believe it's no longer worth it. With the cost of flights increasing plus they price gouge you for everything including check in luggage (which is only 40 pounds max), carry on luggage, picking your seat per person per flight, in-flight snacks/beverages, and now recently they've added on a charge to print off your boarding ticket at the counter. This last flight I truly witnessed how they love to price gouge their customers. My husband and I did not want to pay the fees to have to sit together - I think it's ridiculous that an airline should charge for this - it should be a courtesy. However, the airline will deliberately separate you and when you do an online check-in the night before, they will show you that you are separate, that you can't change it at the counter and that you have to pay $$ if you don't want to sit next to a stranger. I was 31 weeks pregnant and we were placed at two opposite ends of the plane, me row 14 and my husband row 29. Two rows in front of my husband were two empty seats where we could have been placed together. Also, next to me was a young single girl who could have been moved elsewhere very easily, and also about 5 rows behind me were two additional empty seats. Of course the staff tells everyone not to switch seats. Just goes to show how Allegiant Air doesn't really care about taking care of their customers, they just want your money. It's sickening to me and instead of paying that fee so I can sit next to my husband, we're choosing other airlines from now on. Plus I maybe ran into one friendly person the entire round trip flight.

I have flown all over the world and I have never been angry about delays, flight cancellations because they happen and I'm a reasonable person who can deal if a curve ball is thrown. Allegiant air has no rhyme or reason for anything. They don't give you a straight answer. It took me 11 hours to get to Arizona from Ogden Utah. They first told us it was on behalf of the 3 inches of snow outside. This was untrue because had the plane been on time we would have missed the snow entirely. Then they stated that a plane was coming for us but was diverted to St. George to refuel. There is no allegiant hub in St. George. Then they told us that the plane from St. George was on it's way back but that is not the plane we will be taking anymore. Then they told us the plane we are taking had mechanical difficulties so we will continue to be delayed. The most frustrating part of this whole ordeal was that we couldn't get a straight answer from anyone. Allegiant refused to refund out flight as well as refused to offer any kind of voucher for our extreme inconvenience. They wouldn't let me talk to any supervisors on the customer service line and refused to give me any names of the customer service agents. This is not the first time I have flown with Allegiant and it is not the first time I have been given the run around story of why they can't keep a schedule. I will not fly this airline again. If you value you your job and need to be back at work when you say you will instead of stranded in another state do not fly with Allegiant. Cheaper fares? After they nickle and dime  you for everything from bringing your own purse, to charging you for a half a can of soda, you end up saving maybe 100 bucks.

When we flew in October, the incoming plane had mechanical issues in Fl, and our flight eventually was delayed overnight. Allegiant processed the full plane of passengers as quickly as they could and got anyone who had to travel over 30 minutes to get home put up in a local hotel. As we waited in line for our hotel vouchers, the crew passed out bottled water and chocolates and chatted with us to help ease the wait. In addition to a night in a hotel (which probably cost them more than what we paid for our flight to begin with!) we each got a $100 voucher for future travel - we are using it in January and will end up flying round trip from NH to FL for $13, plus the cost of picking our seats because my hubbs likes a window, and because of motion sickness, I need an aisle seat - and we both like the extra leg room seats. So for a grand total of $79, we have the seats of our choice and round trip fare. I find Allegiant customer service to be quite pleasant. The seats are as OK as most that I have had on other airlines - it's a 3 hour flight, I can sit in almost anything as long as I have room for my longish legs. All in all, we continue to fly Allegiant and are very happy with their rates, their service, and their airline in general. We are minimalist and can each fit what we need for a 10-12 day stay into a bag that conforms to Allegiant's standards for a free personal item that stows under the seat in front of us - but, having said that, if we needed to check bags, it would be more than worth the extra charge since parking at the terminal in Portsmouth, NH is free.

There are some outstanding features of Allegiant Air, such as being able to book your flight only a week out and still get a decent fare. That is their best quality. However they charge you for everything after the standard fare, for your seat selection, for insurance, for both checked luggage and a carry on, and they allot you only 40 pounds maximum, not 50. They give you no drinks and no snacks. I asked for a cup of water to refill my water bottle and was denied. Only water for medicine taking, I was told. The seats are the worst feature. They are hard molded plastic with no padding in the backs and little padding in the seat itself. I have osteoporosis and when I finished my four hour trip, I had knots in my upper back and aching muscles in my lower back. No matter what position you try, it is uncomfortable,. There is no elastic seat bag in front of you to hold things in, like your water or a pen or kleenex. Only an open hard plastic slot that is not enclosed. All food costs money. You are restricted from standing in line to use the bathroom and there is no way to get out your seat in time to make it there before someone else closer beats you out. You board the plane from a covered staircase in the outdoors. The seats are very narrow and anyone who is large or tall cannot help but spill over into your space, making for a cramped and painful position for hours.

The next least expensive option was American. It would have been $2332 plus $100 for 2 checked bags. It also includes a connection in Charlotte and takes 4 hours. Nearly $1900 less. The difference is less than our vacation rental is for the entire week after taxes and cleaning. I always get my boarding pass online and check the bags with a sky cap. You just show your boarding passes on your phone to the gate and you're on the plane. Alot of people on here are saying they'd pay more for larger carrier and I have to say go ahead. I also can't agree that the airline nickel and dimes people. I'll happily pay less for things I don't need. As for the customer service, I never need anything from them so I let them do their job.

The slimline seats aren't bad for a couple hour flight (I'm 6'0"") and as long as you learn how to fly and pack for the discount airlines like Allegiant Air or Frontier you won't be shocked when you either book or arrive at the airport. Do your research and read before you book and they'll get you from point A to B which in reality is all we needed. Flew Frontier on the way down to FLL and it was a similar experience and seats.

I used to suggest this airline to my friends and family in and from Rockford, IL because they fly directly from Rockford to the east valley and spared us the drive from Chicago. Let me tell you, the drive from Chicago is well worth it if you don't have to deal with this awful excuse of an airline.  For some stupid reason, my husband and I decided to use Allegiant Air for a trip back to Rockford, IL for my grandmother’s 90th birthday. We had been planning this trip for a year. Both my husband and I are veterans so I have flown in everything from a 4-seater plane, a 12 seat passenger plant, a C-5 Galaxy, to a large civilian plane from Kuwait to Amsterdam to Chicago. In all that time I have never come close to experiencing such incompetence and poor customer service as I did when attempting to fly with this joke of an airline. Having used this airline a few times, I knew that check in and security took approximately 15-20 minutes, which was a good thing considering there are no amenities in the airport for your wait after check in except for some vending machines. We arrived at the long term parking about an hour and a half before our flight. We watched two buses pass us right by until we ran after one and caught it before it left us as well. That wait cost us almost 30 minutes. When we arrived at the check in gate there were no other passengers in line. We arrived at the ticket counter and the girl at the desk said she could print out our boarding passes but it would cost and extra $5 each. That’s not a huge deal, but she said she could download the app on my phone and we wouldn’t have to pay the fee. We weighed our bags and had to move some things around to make weight. The girl at the desk suggested different ways to move things about and was telling anecdotes about overweight bags and such and didn't seem in any rush at all. Then she started messing with my phone to download the app for the free boarding pass. Once again, there was no sense of urgency or warning. This process took about 15 minutes. Once she finished with my phone, she informed us that it was now too late to print our boarding pass and we wouldn’t be able to board the plane. She said Allegiant Air had a policy that they stopped printing boarding passes 40 minutes before the flight. Our flight was at 1:51 and the time when she told us this was 1:13, meaning it was 38 minutes before our flight. We were literally denied our flight because of 2 minutes and the plane was still sitting in the tarmac! Allegiant Air flights are delayed, so there was even more available time than that. We would have been able to make the flight if she had just told us that we didn’t have time to mess around with the stupid phone app and our luggage beforehand! We brought this up and she tried to tell us that we were too late when we walked up to the desk. Um, if it was too late at that point, then why in the world did she tell us to download the app and mess around with our luggage? Shouldn't she have told us that as soon as we walked up to the counter instead of chatting away for another 15 minutes? She said that we could reschedule for the following Monday for $75 per person.

No bells and whistles: very basic seats that do not recline, and no personal TV monitor. Oh well, it was a 2.5 hour flight, and I was not expecting anything luxurious.

We experienced mechanical issues on both the departing and return flights. Our return was delayed by 2 hours because they had no mechanic on duty. Allegiant Air does not follow industry standards with regards to baggage weights. Instead of the standard 50 pounds for checked luggage they use 40 pounds as the maximum. An overage by even one pound incurs a $50 fee.

When I booked our last fights you see the ticket prices and think, that's a good or reasonable deal. You pay for every single aspect of the entire flight. You pay for your ticket in the following ways: two people traveling round trip- two tickets per person each way (180ish) okay reasonable, must pay approx $20 per seat per flight to pre select your seat (even in middle seat!), must pay for all checked bags, only allowed one carry on not two like other airlines, then pay $22 to pay for the tickets at check out to use a card. Then you have to pay $5 per person per flight to check in at the airport.

Well Allegiant did weigh our bag and it weighed 51 pounds and they charged us another $50 so our 1 checked bag cost us $100 which was the cost for one of our plane tickets, which is outrageous. Other airlines usually only charge $25 and another $25 if it's over 50 pounds. Also, not to mention they do not offer a complimentary beverage.

Our flight on 8/7/15 from LAX to MTJ was delayed over 3 hours. The issue seemed to be mechanical. It was very confusing when the screen at the gate did not have the updated departure time despite the fact that passengers were receiving text message flight alerts with delayed flight times. At one point the screen at the gate even said ""now boarding"" which was obviously incorrect. When I asked a gate agent which information was accurate, they were not helpful and did not seem to be informed. My flight from MTJ (Montrose) on 8/10/15 was delayed 7 hours. We were told that the plane departed Los Angeles to come to Montrose and had to divert to Arizona for repairs. I should have just assumed that the flight would be delayed and waited to go to the airport. I want an airline to fix the necessary repairs on a plane that I'm about to fly, but it is unnerving when the repairs are happening while you wait for the very same plane. It would be much more efficient if the planes were constantly maintained so that these long wait times would not be necessary. I also think it is ridiculous to charge a customer for a cup of water on a flight when they've been waiting in a very small and very hot airport for over 7 hours.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'LAX to MTJ', 'Date Flown': 'August 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Ground Service': 2, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-08-12,6,10,Allegiant Air customer review,Erin D Bailey,First time flying this airline. Couldn't beat the deal to get to Orlando for family vacation. On the way down - no problems. Had the bulkhead seats and were quite comfortable. Was a little surprised by the request to clean the area and set the seat belts for the crew. On our way home I was asked to remove my earbuds (not plugged into anything) before takeoff. This was quite surprising as I was using them as earplugs to drown out the sound of the young child behind me who was throwing a fit and kicking the seats. After I took out my earbuds I covered up with my wrap and tried to get some rest (it was an early morning). The attendant tapped me on my shoulder while I was sleeping to ask if my seatbelt was fastened - and he had just been there to see that it was fastened and my earbuds were out.

My return trip was also delayed one hour and there were no weather related incidents - just poor management from this airline. On the return trip we were asked to general maintain the aircraft upon arrival at IWA. It wasn't much but isn't this why we pay so much for the airfare and two dollars for a glass of water?

2015-08-07,9,10,Allegiant Air customer review,Joyce Campisi,"Our flight out of Pittsburgh was delayed due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft. The gate agents tried their very best to keep everyone informed. It was a very long delay, we were scheduled to leave early morning and never departed until very late evening. They eventually re-routed another plane to Pittsburgh to fly us to Jacksonville. Delays and mechanic problems can happen, I wouldn't want to fly on a questionable aircraft. I believe Allegiant did all that they could do, things just happen. We were given water and snacks at the gate while we all waited and thank goodness for the great nearby bars/restaurants in the airport. Allegiant is a low cost budget carrier, so, you get want you pay for. A no frills airline. How can you complain even with the long delay, (mechanical problems and weather) do happen, the airlines doesn't have control over those things. For the cost of the flights, even with the carry on and boarding fees you can't beat their prices. You need to understand, that Allegiant does not have co-shares with the major airlines so they cannot put you on another flight with another airline, so you are stuck and have to wait for them to fix the problem. I'm sure they don't want unhappy customers any more than we want to be unhappy customers. I say give them a try, do plan extra time and remember, you are flying for a very low fare, decide if paying triple on a major airlines for the same flight is worth it.

To make matters worse, they cannot tell you when your flight will be. So now we are stranded in Raleigh, North Carolina waiting for either a phone call or text message to let us know when our flight will be.

2015-08-01,2,10,Allegiant Air customer review,Gregory Robbins,Flight and rental car were both booked through Allegiant. The flight from Cincinnati was delayed due to someone inadvertently deploying an emergency shoot. It took over 6 hours to get the plane fixed with no options for alternative flights. The pilot gave out erroneous information about the situation during the delay. We were assured once we got to our destination that the rental car agency would be monitoring the flight and someone would be available to assist. Upon arrival no one was at the counter and the security guard said no one was ever available off hours no matter what the airline or rental car agency (Alamo) said. No Allegiant representatives were available or could be reached by phone.

So everyone waited patiently for about 2 hrs, then all of a sudden here comes that loud voice again and it said we don't have the part to fix it.

Until Friday July 24 2015, our complaints have been minimal and at most had delayed departures because the planes weren't there yet! However, as of Friday July 24 2015, my family and I will no longer be flying Allegiant. We had an early flight out (6.45am), had checked in the night before, and arrived at 6.00am to depart as the airport is so small, it never takes more than 10 minutes to check in and get to gate. We couldn't find any signage indicating where to check bags through for Cincinnati and simply got in a line curbside because I had five days earlier experienced the same thing when dropping my son off to fly same route and had been directed there for checking his bag. We got in a fairly slow, long line and just as we reached the check-in attendant, after having been interrupted several times, she made the announcement baggage check in to Cincinnati, and several other cities was inside! We go back inside the Allegiant terminal, get in another line only to find out as we approached counter, we're told baggage check for Cincinnati was in Terminal A and pointed to a different area (one we never knew existed)! The attendant then tells us the flight just closed and we'd have to find another flight home and the fees would be $75 each person to do so. We explained we'd been there in lines trying to figure out where we were to check in and saw no indication Cincinnati was in Terminal A. To top it all off, the flight we were supposed to be on that closed at 6.10 had a thirty minute delayed departure. Had we known prior to arriving, we were to go to a different check in terminal, I would not be wasting my time sharing my negative review.

Once you pay the ""fare"" for their flight, you have to pay extra for each bag, including carry on luggage. If you don't pay online ahead of time for your bags you pay significantly higher prices to pay at the airport. You also must pay extra to choose a seat and extra for ""priority boarding"" and you are charged $5 if you do not print your boarding pass at home.

My second call resulted in a 57 minute hold after which I was told ""oh sorry"" for the hold and assured numerous times that there would be absolutely no further delays. I received two additional texts after that delaying my flight until midnight and then 1am. I am certain it is only a matter of time before it is cancelled completely.

2015-07-19,1,10,Allegiant Air customer review,Tandi Spencer,"We were to fly back to Pittsburgh on July 13, 2015 at 5.18 on flight 869. We boarded at about 5.00. When we entered the plane, it was extremely hot with 150 passengers. It was 95 degrees on the plane and there was no air blowing from the overhead vents. We waited on the tarmac to pull away from the gate for an hour in that heat. Flight attendants kept claiming the air would start as soon as we got up in the air and would cool down. Everyone was hot and complaining. Finally, the pilot said there was an error message and we had to get off the plane for maintenance to work on the issue. Maintenance showed up and could not fix it, we could not get another plane that night. After two hours they announced that we could find our own hotel up to $225 and would be reimbursed. The flight was rescheduled for 2.00pm the next day, which was inconvenient as the whole day is gone. We had plans for the next day just like every other passenger. The next day, we check in and I ask how to get reimbursed for food and hotel and the airport representative says she does not know if Allegiant is even reimbursing for food anymore. We show up for our flight and once again we don’t start boarding until 1.40. We notice that it’s the same plane. As we get on the plane, we realize it’s even hotter than the day before and even more uncomfortable. Once again, we take forever to board and we start to pull away from the gate. We are waiting on the tarmac for close to an hour as everyone is miserable and uncomfortable. I am pregnant, there were infants and toddlers that parents had to undress down to their diapers just to try and stay remotely cool. The flight attendants started to bring out complementary waters, but only made it halfway through the passengers, so not everyone even got water including myself. The pilot finally starts to take off and then we pull back into the gate. We are told an emergency plane will be there at 6.30, we will receive a $150 voucher per person, and we will receive food vouchers to eat in the airport. Our food vouchers were $8 each, which hardly covers any meal at the increased prices of food at the airport. We reluctantly decide to wait for the emergency plane.

Allegiant even deleted our boarding passes on their app so used ID's at gate to board. Air conditioning did not work for several rows of seats, while my husband's did not turn off and it froze.

We received no notice at Hancock international of the delay. When the flight finally arrived at about 6.30 we were told there were some indicator lights flashing that needed to be checked out, but we would be boarding shortly. At about 8.30 we were told they were doing some diagnostics and paperwork and the issues did not affect the safety of the plane and the pilot said we would be going. A bit later we were told that the paperwork was still being done and we would be going provided we got wheels in the air by 11.02pm. They had us board at about 10.15 and I must say A 10-15 minute boarding of a full flight was impressive. We were pushed to the tarmac where we sat for about 30 minutes. Eventually we were told they had to power down and restart to reboot the computer. We finally were deplaned and given a hotel voucher but had to pay for taxi to it ($35). Flight rescheduled for 12pm the following day, we finally took off a bit after 5pm. We were given very infrequent updates, lied to about the issue, lied to that another plane was being flown up.

The allegiant to go app. failed to work for me. The reason for the delay was because the flight crew had reach their maximum flight hours and had to rest for twelve hours. The flight itself was very loud. They don't tell you that Sanford Airport is a 45 minute drive to Orlando and the cheapest transport there is a minimum of 90 dollars. On the night before our trip back we received the alert to check in and once again the app. would not work. This time I couldn't access their website either.

Finally was able to email screen shots and print from my email. The return flight was on time and landed without incident.

You will pay for everything including carry-ons, beverages (yes, even water), even printing boarding passes at the airport. Also one thing to keep in mind is the checked bag weight limit is 40 lbs, instead of the standard 50 lbs with other airlines. This too is stated on their website.

Two (2) hour delay leaving St. Petersburg, 45 minute delay leaving Knoxville on my return flight. I have used this airline countless times over the years, and have even recommended it to friends.

We had to upgrade one of the bags we already paid for. Got through security just fine but the gate agent threatened to close the boarding door on my wife as I finished in security 20 mins before the flight left. We ended up being delayed leaving the gate because of a technical problem with the lavatory. The attendants yelled at several passengers because the did not put their phones away.

Because for a while, it was the only airline that I can find that went to my destination. But it began with 2 hour delays on the flight (they seem to only fly one plane in one route all day so if the first plane is behind, the entire day is lost). Don't expect anyone to be at the counter if you arrived 2 hours before your flight is supposed to leave.
