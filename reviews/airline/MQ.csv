The first thing related to Heavy rain and little storm, its still reasonable for the delay at that time for around 1.5 hrs. And then, they allows us to boarding and waits for 45 minutes in the airplane after the door closed. Next, I think due to queue in the taxy way, we just being round and around the airport for 1 hour. And they decided to back to gates because need to refuel the airplane. Took around 45 minutes, and the passenger allowed to go out to have a quick drink, or to bathroom while refueling. After that due one passenger decided to leave, all the passengers need to leave the airplane and re-boarding again and wait for like 10 minutes again in the terminal. After that, we fly to GSO normally.

Anyway, two flight attendants showed up and we were able to board. I asked one of the attendants (who was very helpful and courteous) if she had been flown in to work the flight (I thought what the woman said earlier might have been valid and that the crew that might have been on a plane that dealt with birds flying into the engine, caught a different flight to attend to the plane in Phoenix) but she said there were two no-call no-shows and she and the other attendant were called in to work that flight. Thank goodness those two women showed up or who knows how long it would have taken for us to get out of that airport. I know we cannot blame the entire airline for irresponsible crew members, but there is obviously something going on there. Maybe they need to have overflow staff to assure flights are not delayed due to staff members not showing up.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Phoenix to Palm Springs', 'Date Flown': 'August 2023', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Ground Service': 3, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them. But my attitude is always positive and welcoming and I expect no less than those whose service I have procured - and this was clearly substandard.",,"{'Aircraft': 'CRJ900', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'First Class', 'Route': 'Sarasota to Charlotte', 'Date Flown': 'April 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 2, 'Ground Service': 5, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 2, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The entire flight lost their connection flights and had to suffer the long day at the air port because no one knew how to connect a flight to another flight. We weren’t given any options. Nothing to help us get through. Some customers had medical Conditions that required eating before medication and nothing. As we were waiting the toilets got stuffed up and couldn’t flush any more.

However this time I felt compelled. I was recently a passenger on a flight from Charlotte to New Bern, North Carolina. It had been a weekend. I was boarding the plane. With two bags strategically positioned but still somewhat awkwardly, on my person making my way to my seat. I was wearing new platform sneakers I treated myself to. It had been a year. I think we can all relate. The person in front of me stopped in his tracks to snatch up a spot to place his item in the “overhead bin”. So I had to stop mid step and took a step back. Of course, this happened to be right in front of someone of your staff sitting in one of the rows. He looked at me and said “too much to drink?” I felt instantly embarrassed. Because he wasn’t quiet and discreet. “No sir” I said. but thank you. What I wanted to say was, I did have a glass of wine prior to boarding. But thank you for assuming that I was drunk. Not that I’ve spent a last minute whirlwind weekend with my family in Massachusetts, after 14 months of not seeing them due to Covid. Not seeing my father with kidney failure for fear of bringing the pandemic to his door step, as I am a primary care nurse practitioner. It wasn’t the weight of a weekend spent desperately making up for lost time and salvaging moments. Not being exhausted staying up with him because he was too afraid to asleep. You don’t know me. I don’t know you. In a world that is already struggling. Be kind. Do not assume the worst. As much as anyone, I know the importance of safety. Ask if I am ok. Or say nothing at all.

I've done this twice in the past year and both trips (a total of 4 flights) provided similar experiences. I have had consistently poor service (or lack thereof). The planes honestly scare me with how many obvious repairs (that don't seem particularly well done) have been done to these ancient airplanes. They seem dirty as well, though that could just be the yellowed plastic from age. The seats are hit or miss depending on how worn out the cushion is. They don't seem to have been replaced since the airplanes were manufactured (probably 20-30 years ago by the looks of them). The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in. This is more FYI, since they can't really control the size of the overhead compartments (though they could buy planes made in this decade and solve this issue). The counter was supposed to have staff from 4 am - 7 pm, according to a sign on their counter. There was no one there at all. Keep in mind this small airport has 2 gates and an average of 3 flights a day. I would presume having an employee man the counters for three flights wouldn't be too much to ask, but apparently it is for American Eagle. I can't really comment on their in-flight service since, in all fairness, their flights are usually too short to be able to provide any services. However, I can comment that the pilots do not fly well, and I legitimately thought the plane had crash landed at first when the plane just dropped several meters out of the sky on landing. In the future I will just fly into DFW and drive the 3 hours to San Angelo.

Then American Airlines pressured me into buying trip insurance, telling me that it would cover any airline changes and cancellations. As I boarded the plane going home, AA cancelled the connecting flight. When I landed in Dallas, I received text that AA re-booked connecting flight for the next day. Now they don't want to pay for the cancelled and re-booked flight (that I was unable to take & I had to rent a car to drive 6 hours home which cost me over 300 dollars). When they were pressuring me to buy the insurance, they NEVER told me the insurance only kicks in after a 12 hr delay. This delay was overnight. Meaning I originally had an evening connecting flight that was cancelled. So, my children & I were supposed to spend the night in DFW airport Isn't that why I bought trip insurance To cover the costs when this happens I know they cannot control the weather, but they could honor the insurance they pressure their customers to buy and not make ridiculous parameters that hinder customers from receiving relief from the insurance. Furthermore, ridiculous fees AA charges for changing flights (after booking the same day within a few hours) is even more reason why I love Southwest. American Airlines need to take lessons from SWA.

I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking, and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke? It's a simple math that if the flight is full, they should not take any more customers, but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time, they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule; this is outrageous. They are ruthless when it comes to customers being late to board on the flight, and if it's other way around, they want our patience - very frustrating. Another problem was that the flight landed in Cleveland to fuel their gas. This was very upsetting because this implies that they did not fully fuel their gas to get to Toronto. I can't stop myself thinking that they can't do math. This delayed another 2 hours or so, and we finally landed to Toronto at 5:00 pm, instead of 2:31 pm.

2016-06-01,1,10,"""a vast contrast""",N Owens,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",,"{'Aircraft': 'E145', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'Premium Economy', 'Route': 'CMH to LGA', 'Date Flown': 'May 2016', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 5, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I was concerned the whole trip since the bag was checked and it contained all the things we want to carry with us and not check. However, the bag was delivered planeside. The service was good and I'll fly American Eagle again but will make every effort to avoid their CRJ-900 with the small overhead bins.",yes,"{'Aircraft': 'CRJ-900', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'First Class', 'Route': 'ABQ to DFW', 'Date Flown': 'August 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Food & Beverages': 3, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-08-07,9,10,American Eagle customer review,Roger Lubbers,"Unbelievably high quality experience from this carrier. Boarded promptly, crew very helpful in terms of getting carry on bags stowed into very small overhead bins. Can't remember the last time a flight attendant actually helped get a bag stowed instead of being critical of my efforts. Five stars to the flight attendant in first class. Flight left a few minutes early, arrived fifteen minutes early. Had a truly excellent lunch, would have been pleased to pay for it. Couldn't remember the last time that happened on a US carrier. Hope that this signals a new era at American Eagle.",yes,"{'Aircraft': 'Embraer 75', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'First Class', 'Route': 'ORD to EWR', 'Date Flown': 'August 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Food & Beverages': 5, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2015-07-17,9,10,American Eagle customer review,Bob Motto,"Excellent flight with great service provided by the cabin crew. Drinks served prior to take off, and during the flight too.

2015-06-12,1,10,American Eagle customer review,Michael Peoples,"Terrible experience all around. Flight delayed three hours, no place to hang my dress uniform and generally terrible/confrontational service. If these people spent half the time they do berating customers actually doing their jobs correctly maybe they wouldn't have such a terrible track record with customer service. If I have a choice next time I won't fly with them, I don't even care if it costs more.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Business Class', 'Route': 'Manhattan KS to Little Rock AR via DFW', 'Date Flown': 'June 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-05-29,9,10,American Eagle customer review,L Barron,I flew from Chicago ORD airport to Houston IAH on Monday May 25th. The flight left on time and arrived to Houston early. The flight was good because there aren't many seats onboard this plane so check in and leaving is much quicker than on normal flights.,yes,"{'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 4, 'Inflight Entertainment': 0, 'Value For Money': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
