But the departure gate was changed to B15 without any notification. I was consequently unaware of this change and missed my flight. The only notification was the departure screen which is barely readable as it is constantly changing. There were no PA announcements, no text messages, no phone calls, apparently no alerts to App holders, but I don’t fly frequently enough to justify it. My friend who helped me book the flight does, but he didn’t give me any warning either so I was unawares.

The value of the suitcase on the market is $180 dollars. When I arrived I immediately claimed at the counter, I showed them the suitcase and they only told me to do it online without receiving any help, they ignored me. Rest for 2 days after you arrive. and I returned to activities in the United States and tried to communicate again and it was impossible. Finally an advisor answered me and the damaged luggage claim page was not working either by cell phone or by a laptop computer. 7 days passed and when I was finally able to make the claim they told me that 7 days had already passed and that for that absurd reason and their platforms were not working they were not going to be responsible for my luggage. They gave me a 100 dollar voucher to travel with them. Who in their 5 senses would travel with that airline after they damage your luggage and then they don't want to pay you for the suitcase and you have to put your money to buy another one when they were the ones who damaged it?

2024-09-07,1,10,“staff have been completely unhelpful”,Teresa Vaghi,"Not Verified | I honestly would give negative 5 stars if I could. On 30th June, Delta cancelled our flight and couldn’t get us on another flight for 3 days. I have emailed them multiple times trying to get my expenses refunded and it’s been 2.5 months and I’m not even close to getting a resolution. Our boarding was delayed and when we got on the plane it was discovered a passenger with the same name as somebody on our flight, but who was meant to be flying on another airline, had made their way onto our flight (don’t even get me started on how much of a security risk that is, that’s a whole other issue!). As the flight to Johannesburg is 16 hours, the extra delay meant a crew member would’ve been over their hours if the flight took off (again, don’t even get me started on how you can schedule so that small delay can cause this). We sat on the plane for 3 hours before being told the flight was cancelled and to go to customer service in the airport to rebook our flight. Imagine hundreds of passengers at 1am with 3 customer service agents trying to get onto other flights. We were also on the phone to customer service at the same time as queuing. There were flights available with partner airlines but they wouldn’t put us on any of those, I assume because it would’ve been very expensive last minute. Eventually after hours of queuing and being on hold on the phone they said the next flight would be 3 days later. So now we are stuck in Atlanta for 3 days. I live in Cayman Islands and my sister lives in NYC. Even though my sister and I are not booked on the same ticket they expected us to share a room. I said that I wanted my own room and I was eventually given my own voucher. We got to the hotel after nearly 24 hours of no sleep only to be told that the hotel was full and that delta daily sends delayed passengers with no regard that the hotels are fully booked. We then had to walk with all out luggage to another hotel. When we got to the second hotel they said my sister had a voucher for 3 nights but mine was only for 1 night. So I was forced to share with my sister. What if she wasn’t with me? I would’ve had to pay out of pocket for a hotel room (which I wouldn’t be refunded for because delta is doing everything possible not to refund me). The hotel was also really far away, there was only fast food in the area so we had to Uber everywhere. Of course the airline won’t refund us for any of that. Not to mention that we had to entertain ourselves for the 3 days and I was completely unprepared for 100 degree weather as I was traveling to South African winter. This meant I had to buy new clothes. The cost of the delay is hundreds of dollars but they would only refund my sister $125 and they are delaying processing mine. Two and a half months later and I still don’t know how, when and how much my refund will be. I feel like delta is using constant delay tactics so they don’t have to pay me the refund. Also, absolutely no mention of any compensation for a 3 day delay which resulted in us missing a family event and we didn’t get to see our aunt who had been unwell and passed away shortly after. In all this the Delta staff have been completely unhelpful. The person who has been dealing with my refund keeps asking me for a tax number which we haven’t got in the Cayman Islands as we don’t have tax. I have told them 3 times that we don’t have it and they just keep telling me to ask my bank.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Cayman Islands to Johannesburg via Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'June 2024', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

While running through the aerobridge to catch my connecting flight, I was also preparing my boarding pass on my phone and there it says, ""we are sorry you missed your flight"" and the Delta was offering an alternative flight with a layover for 12 hours. It asked me to accept the proposal which I did not hoping that I'd find another earlier flight. To my disappointment, all the flights they had for ATL to YUL was from 9:00 PM with arrival time of 11:49 PM. After rechecking my phone again, Delta rebooked me for the 9:00 PM flight with arrival time of 11:49 in YUL. I didn't have a choice in this situation so I had to sit all day and long hours (12 hours in total) at the airport. Airport was so crowded and hot and humid and food was expensive.

The last time I flew on Delta was probably in May 2020, but this review thing would not let me choose that far back. I have an upcoming flight next week and need to change my return ticket to a different airport as there was a death in our family this week. I've been trying to get a hold of someone at Delta's customer service for many hours. I keep getting a wait time of over 2 1/2 hours to speak to a representative by phone. I can't remember my Delta.com password and attempted to change my password. It wasn't sending me the email to change the password and by the time it did, I was locked out of my account requiring me to provide verification of identity to get back in; however, it was suggested that I wait 24 hours to try again. That is absolutely ludicrous. Thankfully the funeral isn't for another two weeks; however, it is super frustrating that I have to wait that long to get back into my account and even then, it is not a guarantee. I'm super frustrated that I can't talk to a person on the phone for help. I tried via a chat and part way into the conversation with a real person, they weren't responding very quickly, even though I provided all the information they needed (confirmation number, flight information for what I want to change to, my name that is on the itinerary, etc.). I asked if they could call me instead, but then they told me to call them. I had been trying to do just that for a long time and it was getting me nowhere. I'm super overwhelmed and stressed out right now because of this situation and explained that it is due to a death in the family. They could have been way more helpful and caused a lot less stress and anxiety on my end in this delicate situation. This is the third family death for us this year. Why couldn't the CS representative just call me back? They have my number. Eventually that person set up the chat on a bot. At the time, I had no idea what that meant. The bot was not helpful at all as it kept saying it didn't understand what I was telling it, even though I gave it the same information as the live person on the chat.

On the morning of the 19th of July at 9am PST while walking my dog I learned of the issues with the “Global IT outage”. I ran home, checked the Delta flights & found them cancelled. There was NO notification of this change. I immediately tried calling, messaging & accessing Delta’s website. I sat at my kitchen table for 11 hours that day with 2 computers & 3 phones unable to reach anyone. I was on hold for 7 hours until the call dropped. Delta’s chat bot kept asking if I “was still there” and every time I responded “yes” it gave me a longer wait time for a representative than the previous estimate. I called my mother & her sisters and told them to get to the airport as quickly as possible, this was something they would have to solve in person at a Delta Counter. Technology was the problem; I could not help them from California via computer or phone. It was already afternoon in Florida. They arrived at the Orlando airport with their luggage at 3pm and stood in line for hours only to have the Delta agent turn them away with a flyer of useless information redirecting them to use Delta’s app or website. Neither functional, nor is it appropriate to expect 80 year old ladies to navigate a digital world. They returned to the Delta Counter but were told repeatedly that Delta could not rebook them on another flight and that they had to go to other counters and sort it themselves only to be told at both Southwest & Alaska that Delta had the responsibility of rebooking them. These ladies dragged their bags across the airport until 11pm that evening. In total they were turned away from the Delta counter 3 times & ultimately unable to arrive in Seattle in time to make the sailing. This is the most egregious failure to meet a Contract of Carriage I have ever experienced. When Frontier can go old school and pull out paper tickets in order to meet their contract of carriage but Delta chooses to strand & abandon ALL clients it is clear who is the better carrier. We arrived at the Seattle port Saturday morning to spend 2 hours waiting for Princess Cruise lines to agree to allow our ladies to board in Juneau as apparently this is a violation of some maritime law creating more fines & distress. If I haven’t been clear the entire point of this Holiday was to celebrate the person left stranded in Orlando, whom I disgracefully booked on Delta. My financial losses are such: Last minute one way flight to Juneau $ 2547.99 Unused Seattle Hotel $ 347.23 Last minute Juneau Hotel $",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Orlando to Seattle', 'Date Flown': 'July 2024', 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

This time, they didn't go though my checked bags but I was subjected to a thorough inspection of my carry on and had to remove my shoes (none of the other passengers had to do this). I became quite irate but the attendant there at the gate  remained calm and did tell me that they had detected a suspicious substance on my hand when they did that swab thing.

If your system is not capable of doing online check-ins, then don’t even ask your customers to do that. The staff abused their authority to threaten customers, forced customers to apologize and even took away customers’ right to be angry.  After I boarded the flight, the gentleman who sat next to me also complained how their seats were messed up and the horrible attitude their family received from Delta’s staff because they had a child who needed special care.

I was flying back home to Washington, D.C., from Austin, TX. Due to some issues, the first flight was delayed. There was no way that I would make my connection in Detroit. I was devastated as I needed to get home as soon as possible. I kept looking for other flights, but my missed connection was the night's last flight to IAD. I would have to wait until the morning for the next flight. Unexpectedly, a kind flight attendant approached me on the plane and said, “Hey, I noticed that you missed your connection to Dulles Airport, but I found this delayed flight heading to Reagan Airport. If you don’t mind changing airports, you can be in DC tonight instead of tomorrow morning. Is this something you would like to do?” I immediately said YES! I needed to get home right away, so arriving home 40 minutes after my original flight was much better than waiting until the morning. Upon arrival at Reagan National, I checked with Delta about my luggage. As expected, they were delayed. However, they assured me that my suitcases would be delivered the next day to my house, and they kept their word! What a relief! With everything going on, the last thing I needed was to go to the airport to retrieve my things. And I am so thankful for that. What this flight attendant doesn’t know (because I didn’t ask for a flight change or even mention my situation to anyone. This was just amazing customer service is that she helped me get home on time to be there the last night with my very special recently adopted cat. See, he was special because he was the sweetest cat I’ve ever met; he only wanted to be on my lap all the time and to be petted nonstop. He was blind, and he was my friend’s cat, who unexpectedly passed away in April this year, and I took in my sweet baby. He got very sick and was getting worse by the hour. He was waiting for me to get home. I got home at midnight, and he crossed the bridge Thursday afternoon. Thanks to this kind soul and her outstanding customer service, I was there for him, keeping him company during his last night. And for that, I will thank Delta Airlines forever.

Our flight was scheduled to board around 8:40 PM when I arrived at the terminal late I expected the plane to already be boarding. As I stood there about 10 to 20 minutes with all the other passengers waiting to get on the plane finally had an announcement for the agent stating that the client was having maintenance and they would be delayed boarding until 1020 and the flight will takeoff at 11. Once we finally started boarding the plane the 11 o’clock takeoff time came up past. Around 1110 captain came on the intercom and stated that they were working on the plane and they were waiting on the maintenance guy to get back so that Atlanta could work with him to verify the flight was ready to takeoff. About 20 minutes later came back on the intercom stating that maintenance was on the plane and they were going to be working with Atlanta. The pilots were gonna be stepping off because there was going to be a lot of noise in the cockpit would be to takeoff. A little after 12 o’clock, the captain came back on the intercom stating that we were going to have to board this plane. We should’ve never boarded this plane that we should’ve been put on another plane and he was very disgusted with the situation. Continue to say once he had more information, he would let us know what gate we were going to so that we could board a different plane to continue our destination in Buffalo. Around 12:30 AM we finally boarded a different plane and we left a little after 1 AM. When I arrived in Buffalo, the rental car centers were all closed and had to sit in the airport for 3 1/2 hours until they reopened. Due to this delay, my hotel stay for the night that I was billed for didn’t sleep in the bed because I had to continue on to work with my customer that day which now put me being up over 36 hours. I spoke with the Delta agent who told me I need to file a complaint stating what it happened and then I would be compensated to what went on. So I Submitted my complaint to Delta where an agent with an email address from Delta that states wecare.com. Which obviously they do not Delta gave me a 3000 point to my SkyMiles for compensation for what happened that day. So I’m out over $200 for my hotel stay. Lack of sleep because of having to continue to my Customer site without being able to sleep and work 36 hours straight cause of this. Was not able to get a rental car had to sit in the airport for 3 1/2 hours waiting on the rental car center to open because of this. And the supervisor from Delta stated that the best they could do is give me 3000 bones points for this mishap. That shows me the Delta should change their email to say we don’t care what happens to you. I can understand if it’s an act of God due to the weather. But this was an active Delta decided to do a maintenance on a plane that was scheduled for a flight. Confidence of Delta and their response to their customers because of this is ridiculous. I was told by the Delta agent joy that they do not Refund hotel stays that were previously booked. I don’t know most people who don’t previously book travel with the hotel and travel with a car rental center. To be told that the best they can compensate me was 3000 points was ridiculous and that there would be no more further contact with me because that was all they were going to do.

2024-05-29,2,10,"""banned from Delta flights""",Ses Brunton,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding an incident that occurred on my recent Delta flight. The issue involves the behavior of a flight attendant as well as the conduct of the Minnesota ground staff and Delta supervisors. I was a passenger on flight 2987 from Philadelphia to Minnesota, with a connecting flight to Los Angeles (flight 748). Shortly after takeoff on flight 2987, my three-year-old daughter urgently needed to use the restroom. The nearest restroom was in the first-class section, so I began walking her there during mid flight about 20 mins after take off. However, a flight attendant stopped me and informed me that I could not take my daughter to that restroom. I explained that my daughter might have an accident in her seat, but the attendant insisted that we return to our seats, even when I asked if it would be acceptable for my daughter to have an accident. The attendant's response was affirmative, indicating it was acceptable. Reluctantly, I returned to my seat with my distressed and crying daughter. A few minutes later, I observed a man from first class get up and use the restroom without issue. At this point, I decided to return to the restroom with my daughter. I informed the flight attendant that her behavior was unacceptable and hypocritical. I then proceeded to use the restroom with my daughter. During this incident, I asked for the flight attendant's information, and her name which was denied. Upon landing, I sought the flight attendant's information and saw her speaking to the flight supervisor outside the door as we exited the aircraft. I stopped and asked the flight supervisor if we could discuss the situation away from the terminal to avoid blocking customers. He initially told me to wait and talk there, but I suggested we move to the front to avoid obstructing other passengers. The supervisor then insisted I go to the top and wait for him. Once I identified that the supervisor was not handling the situation professionally, I asked to speak to his superior. As I headed up, the flight attendant and I exchanged words during the situation. However, as I was leaving, the flight attendant continued her uncontrolled unprofessional comments and proceeded to clap her hands four times in a confrontational manner, as if she wanted to fight, in front of other flight attendants and supervisors. This behavior went unaddressed. This experience was incredibly frustrating and distressing for both my daughter and me. I believe the treatment we received was unreasonable and lacked basic empathy, especially considering the needs of a small child. As I waited, the day shift manager arrived and, in a rude manner, ignored me to speak with the flight attendant and her supervisor down below at the plane.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, the manager returned, and I tried explained the entire situation to her but of course she interrupted me the whole time. Without listening to my story or understanding what happened, she informed me that I was banned from Delta flights for my conduct and could not reschedule a flight with Delta and use another airline.

Let me start by saying that the 24-hour cancellation window is ridiculously short and unforgiving. Life happens, plans change, and sometimes circumstances force you to alter your travel arrangements beyond this restrictive timeframe. However, Delta seems to lack any empathy or flexibility in this regard. Recently, I had to cancel a ticket I had purchased due to unforeseen circumstances. Imagine my dismay when I realized that I had to cancel within 24 hours of booking to be eligible for any refund whatsoever. This policy is not only inconvenient but also entirely unreasonable. It essentially forces travelers into a rushed decision-making process, leaving no room for any change of plans or emergencies that may arise shortly after booking. But the disappointment didn't end there. Upon canceling my ticket, I was shocked to discover that Delta imposed a hefty $99 cancellation fee. To add insult to injury, they offered me a measly $91 refund for a ticket that originally cost $200. It's simply outrageous that Delta sees fit to penalize their customers to such an extent for exercising their right to cancel within the designated timeframe. The $99 cancellation fee policy feels like a slap in the face to loyal customers who have already invested a significant amount of money in their travel plans. It's a clear case of Delta prioritizing profit over customer satisfaction and goodwill. Such predatory practices not only tarnish the airline's reputation but also erode trust and loyalty among passengers.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Rochester to New Orleans', 'Date Flown': 'May 2024', 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I am somewhat over weight but not morbidly obese. My hips are not abnormally big. This seat was fully metal with no holes below the arms. I could barely squeeze into the seat. It was painful to sit in it. I told the flight attendant that I couldn’t fit and she said the flight was full so there were no other seats. I could not buckle the seat belt so I asked for an extender. She said that an extender could not be used for that seat. So she had to go around and ask the entire plane if someone would switch with me. Thankfully a nice couple in the back agreed to switch and my boyfriend and I had to make the walk of shame to the back while the flight attendant had to loudly notify the pilot to delay take off until we could be reseated. People were glaring at us as we walked back. I was mortified and spent half of the flight crying tears of humiliation. Normally the exit row seats afford passengers more room and larger people book them for that reason. I had no trouble fitting into the regular economy class seat and the seatbelt fit fine. Anyone over a size 12 would have struggled to fit in that seat and we all paid to sit in that section.

We waited an additional 30 minutes. Ultimately, they received a small item that was inconspicuously delivered to a passenger. As it turns out, it was a seatbelt extender. When originally pulling away from the gate, they only had one on board. This particular passenger required a second one. That is what we waited an hour and a half for. It is understood that every person deserves dignity, it is ridiculous to have delayed 90 people a total of two hours, awaiting a seatbelt extender. The passenger requiring this should have been deboarded and placed on the next flight with the appropriate equipment. Additionally, what was most upsetting about this was the deceit. The seatbelt extender was. delivered to the passenger very secretly. The minute it was delivered, we were backed out of the jetway and in a queue of 12 planes to takeoff.

Just because the airline may have included it in fine print somewhere does not give them the right to change things without reason or explanation. The unexpected adjustment not only disrupted my carefully planned schedule but also led to an unplanned day off from work, incurring additional costs and inconveniences. Despite my attempts to call, I was put on hold for hours, and every time someone picked up, they transferred me to someone else without offering any explanation for deciding to switch my flight.

I have always chosen Delta for its reputation for superior service and reliability, but my recent experience has made me reconsider that choice. To begin with, I was taken aback when, after upgrading to Comfort Class, I was relocated from an aisle seat to a middle seat without any prior notification or choice. Such a switch considerably reduced the comfort level I had anticipated with the upgrade. This was the first sign of my forthcoming ordeal. Upon addressing my concern at the airport, I was given a sheer run-around, being referred from one agent to another, with each passing the responsibility onto someone else. It felt as though my comfort and satisfaction as a customer were not valued in the slightest. My in-flight experience was no better. The flight attendants seemed disinterested and distant, making me feel more like a burden than a valued passenger. My simple request for an apple juice was met with confusion as I was handed a diet coke instead. This may seem like a trivial mistake, but it's indicative of the lack of attention to passenger needs. Moreover, after requesting headsets to perhaps distract myself from the accumulating frustrations, I had to repeat my request. Waiting an hour for such a basic amenity is unacceptable, especially when I could see other passengers receiving prompt service. I had hoped that my upgrade to Comfort Class would ensure a pleasant journey, but I found myself facing a series of disappointments and inconveniences. The lack of coordination, attention to detail, and basic courtesy have left a lasting negative impression. I urge Delta to look into these matters seriously.

Things seemed to be smooth as I could select my seat, 1D, and checked on Delta's website that the seat was reserved,  until Delta required me to check-in at the airport. I went to the Delta One section, the check-in agent was very nice and found my reservation, provided to me a boarding pass, only without a seat number. She made several attempts to request for one, but the system only allowed my seat to be assigned at the gate. Not only that, my boarding pass neither showed the class of service nor Sky Priority status, though she ensured me several times that I would be travelling in Delta One. The inconvenience began from there, with the security agent refused to allow me to use the Sky Priority line; not an issue as I was early. I did not get access to the Sky Club; not an issue either as I still could do it with my Amex Platinum card but chose to skip as the Sky Club was packed with a long waiting line. The gate agent finally assigned me a seat, exactly my seat 1D, but only until an hour before boarding. With US carriers having a reputation of dumping passengers for no reason, being through that process is not fun. It got a lot better on board, though not necessarily excellent.

2023-10-19,3,10,"""Such service is incredibly disappointing""",E Gan,"✅ Trip Verified |   This review pertains to the SkyMiles program. During the months of January and February in 2023, I embarked on a series of flights with Delta's partner airlines, which included LATAM, Aerolineas Argentinas, and Saudia. Regrettably, I failed to input my SkyMiles number when booking these flights. Consequently, I had to request mileage credit post-flight, a process that is typically straightforward. However, my experience with Delta proved to be far from hassle-free. Securing mileage credit from Delta proved to be an ordeal that required multiple requests and calls to customer service before any credit was recorded. It was not until September, a full seven months after my initial application, that I finally received mileage credit for the Saudia flights. Astonishingly, during a call with an agent in March, I was told my requests had been “archieved” and thus not acted upon. Then, when I called again in October, the agent advised that they had no record whatsoever that I had put in any request – this despite the fact that the agent in March had advised that my requests were safely in and I need not put them in again. It wasn't until October, following yet another customer service call, that I was granted the deserved credit for the Aerolineas Argentinas flights. However, the same agent informed me that she was unable to credit me for the LATAM flights, citing allegedly missing information in the documents I provided (boarding passes and receipts). In response, I diligently explained via email that all the requisite information was indeed included in the documents, but received no response. When I acquired a letter from LATAM confirming the presence of all necessary details and forwarded it to the agent with a request for confirmation of receipt, I was met with silence once more. Upon reaching out to Delta customer service to follow up, I was met with an abrupt response, being told that I ""could not keep calling them,"" despite this being only my initial follow-up call, and that further contact would supposedly further delay the process. The agent then refused to provide me with any case number or confirmation number for my call – which goes against most customer service protocols. The culmination of these experiences has led me to the unfortunate realization that Delta's customer service falls far short of the expected standards, characterized by contradictory instructions, leading customers on wild goose chases to obtain information already provided, and gaslighting of customers. It appears that this deliberate ""intentional friction"" is designed with the expectation that customers will eventually abandon their pursuit of rightful mileage credit. Such service is incredibly disappointing for an airline that is purportedly renowned for its high level of customer service in the United States.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Date Flown': 'May 2023', 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

This is not the case, he is a chihuahua mix, and I have flown with my dog many times with no issues on much longer flights. She did not offer any solutions, just told me I could not fly with the carrier I had. I got in line to talk to customer service to figure out what my options were, and she then ushered me over again with a manager. The manager told me I could only fly with my dog if I purchased a different carrier from Delta. While the manager went to get the carrier, I waited for 45-50 minutes and almost ran out of time to check my bag. When the manager came back, she had a carrier the same size if not smaller than the one I walked in with. I was flustered and just wanted to get on my flight since I was running out of time, and they charged me $75 for a cramped Delta-branded carrier. I was stressed, my dog was stressed, and I had to literally run through the airport, jostling my poor dog, to make my flight in time (5 minutes later and I would have missed it.)

No sign of boarding, so we took our time. Suddenly the panel changed to last call, a practice I had seen in no other airport in the world. When notifying the harsh eyed lady at the Delta boarding gate, she only shrugged her shoulders and said this was the airport not the airline responsible for this wording. Guest feedback obviously is valued at Delta Airlines.

They couldn't give us any hotel accommodations or nothing. They couldn't supply us with any solutions or offer to help or service us in any way which is poor customer service. We couldn't afford another night at a hotel so we actually ended up sleeping in the airport. They couldn't even supply blankets or nothing.

Fast forward to Monday September 11. We check in our bags go through everything and watching netflix by our gate until it was time to board. I think an hour or so before boarding I get an email saying that this flight is now cancelled. My friend and I check the screen and it still says the flight is on time.

We decided to call and get another refund on the flight all while finding a bus that we could take to get home. We found 1 that was leaving at 10 pm and not too far from the airport. We purchased non refundable tickets, desperate to get home and thinking we would get there in time. We decided to get our bags that we checked and just take this bus. We headed to baggage claim and this was what really got me frustrated. We got there and our bags were not there! We had to wait 4 hours for our suitcases to come out. I asked countless workers where our bags were and we were either dismissed, ignored or not given a direct answer.

I moved to the location they requested when a man working for Delta said in a pressured, loud and aggressive tone “There is a problem with your seat, the TV doesn’t work but we can move you to another seat with a working TV.” I hesitated because this all caught me off guard and said ok but show me the seat and it was a middle seat without the extra leg room. I said no and he said “Are you sure?” and I said I was traveling with my husband and if we can’t sit together we will just keep the seat with the broken tv in comfort plus. As it turns out that TV worked and Delta had been trying to give my seat to someone else for more money! About 15 years ago, I flew Delta and again coming back to the US from Athens, Greece I connected in Paris and they did a similar thing and asked me while I was seated in my seat to get up and they gave my seat that I had a ticket for and was already seated in to a man with the explanation that it was really his seat despite me having a paid ticket and boarding pass with that seat number. I had to stay in the airport for 5 hours waiting for another Delta plane. I never forgot that and it took 15 years for me to fly overseas with Delta again and now they did this.

My flight from Portland OR to Washington DC Dulles Airport originally had a layover in Seattle WA. Due to the first flight having a delay due to a light blinking for something that turned out to not be happening and them needing more fuel in order to be able to make the trip safely, I missed my connecting flight in Seattle WA. The flight arrived 5 minutes before the connecting flight was due to depart. I was unable to reach the gate in time, so I got in line for the customer service. I checked my texts, email and the delta app, but nothing showed up as having an alternate route. It took a while to get through the customer service line. When I reached the counter, I was informed that they had automatically booked me on a new flight even though I hadn't received any notification of this change. They printed my new ticket and said the new flight was due to depart in 15 minutes and was at the gate next to them. I walked over to the gate to find out that they had already closed the gate and weren't boarding the plane anymore. Therefore the tickets that customer service had given me were for a flight that had already finished boarding. So, I had to get back in line again. When I talked to the customer service representative, they told me that it was my fault for missing the second flight and because I had a basic ticket they couldn't help me with another flight option. That they could put me on a waiting list for an open seat going in the general direction. They said that I would just have to wait in the airport until a seat became available and they couldn't tell me when that might happen. I couldn't handle this news that I was stranded at the airport and had no idea when I might be getting another flight. I found a place to break down and cry and just before 11am my delta app notified me the info for the alternative flight that I had missed. This made me mad because this was two hours after I had needed it. So I collected myself and went back to customer service counter. The person who helped me didn't treat me like it was my fault for missing both flights and got me new boarding passes. This whole thing could have been avoided if I had gotten my notification about the reroute a lot sooner or if the customer service person had given me a ticket for a flight that hadn't closed there gates then say it wasn't their responsibility for the missed flight.

My twin boys and I boarded at 3:41 Delta Flight 1043, which had us wait inside the plane in 80+ degrees (inside the aircraft) for over a 1 hour while the crew tried to fix the AC and mechanical issues the plane was experiencing. This caused a delay in our arrival, and our plans changed due to the fact that we missed our car rental and hotel arrival time. After we departed San Antonio, it was hard to relax and watch a movie as the aircraft was having issues with the monitors, and they kept turning on and off three to four more times until they rebooted the system. On our return flight scheduled for Monday, August 21, 2023, our flight was delayed four times before arriving at the airport at 1 PM. While we sat at the airport waiting from 1 PM to 6 PM our flight was delayed two to three more times. Finally, after waiting all afternoon/evening at the airport, at around 9-10 PM we received a message from Delta saying our flight was delayed until 9 AM the next morning August 22, 2023. The Delta attendant informed us that the delay was due to the fact that Delta could not find a Pilot and the replacement pilot they found earlier, had declined as well, so they were left with no pilot and no choice but to push the flight until the next day. The customer service representative helped us book a hotel and offered us an embarrassing and very offensive $15 voucher per person. We arrived at the hotel with no clothes to change into, no toothbrush, no toothpaste, no hairbrush, no pajamas, and no deodorant, with absolutely nothing but dirty clothes we had on from waiting all day at the airport. It was almost 11 PM at night and every store was closed at this time to try and purchase anything. My kids (two 11-year-old boys) were tired, bored, and very impatient. Also, because it was past 11 PM we were extremely tired, and due to most restaurants and stores being closed we were unable to use the food vouchers. We had to wait an additional 20 to 30 minutes for the hotel shuttle to finally pick us up from the airport and drop us off at the Sheraton Hotel. The next day our flight finally departed LAX and we were extremely disappointed to be placed in an old and dirty aircraft with smaller TVs than the normal ones (We booked 6 first-class seats), please see the attached pictures for reference. We also left our vehicle at the San Antonio, TX airport for when we arrived and we had to pay two extra days of car storage at the airport due to our delay, which we do not think is fair. As if that wasn't disappointing enough for Delta, we received an email on 08/22/2023 from Customer Care offering us a $100 Voucher for the horrible experience. Due to the fact that our flight was delayed over 4 hours and per the trip delayed coverage in Delta's guidelines, we are entitled to up to a $700 travel voucher per ticket (4 tickets) and reimbursement for items we paid for during this delay.

Our plane from Mexico City was diverted by a storm 20 minutes from Atlanta and landed in Savannah (presumably because of lack of fuel – this was not a great choice of airport, as it has no customs for an international arrival). As a result of this, we sat on the tarmac for 5.5 hours (beyond the legal limit of 4 hours), given nothing to eat but a small bag of chips and two glasses of water. It turns out there were three such planes stranded on the tarmac that afternoon, one with no food or water and no functioning bathroom. The incident made the local online news and TV and was described as ""unprecedented"". Eventually night fell, the pilots left and we were deplaned and processed through a makeshift customs office, then told to find our own accommodation as Delta had no vouchers, but were explicitly told to keep all receipts. Airport staff booked a hotel for me and three fellow passengers. If I had known I wouldn't be refunded I might have slept in the airport. The next morning we showed up at Savannah Airport at 9 for our 11:30 40-minute flight back to Atlanta. I was rebooked onto my Virgin ATL-LHR flight at 6:40 pm. But we didn't leave Savannah till 5:30 pm! First, we were told the plane needed cleaning, then, as time passed, that Delta were now obliged to rebook every single passenger, including their onward flights, by hand, using a defective printer, and they would call them each by name. Chaos ensued, and the flight kept being delayed by another hour. Half the passengers left and hired cars out of frustration. Of course I missed my Atlanta-London connection for the second time in 24 hours. I was luckily rebooked onto a 10 pm Delta flight to London (not in Premium, which I had booked on my original Virgin flight). We were emailed $400 in Delta vouchers, not as a measure of our inconvenience but as a token gesture of apology. I would simply have liked a clean measure of my inconvenience. When I submitted $250 of receipts to Delta for reimbursement, I spoke to a representative about how I would receive the payment and was told a cheque would be emailed to my UK address. Subsequently, Delta informed me that none of my expenses were eligible for reimbursement as bad weather had caused the disruption. This, however, takes no account of a) their duty of care to stranded passengers and b) the sheer incompetence of Delta staff the following day at Savannah airport which caused many people to miss their onward connections. I have tried texting and calling and have repeatedly been fobbed off and held in lines. Delta, I should say, issued a useful food voucher of $30 at Atlanta airport (this was around 8 or 9 pm, though, the first food we had been given all day) and I was then emailed a transport voucher of $35 (for what?) which wasn't actually in the email. On the phone to Delta this week, I was offered 5000 miles as a token to shut me up, which I refused. And in an email I was sent a conciliatory $90 voucher, again not actually accessible from the email. I won't let this drop.

It ruined our entire first day of our vacation and we ended up having to book with a different airline last minute because Delta had nearly no other same day flight options except a red eye late night flight. We spent 5 hours in line trying to find other options, and probably over 10 hours by now on hold waiting to get customer service agents to pick up and help. We have spoken to 4 agents at least, and none have been willing to help or hold Delta accountable for the major inconvenience we had in our vacation due to their own doing. They cost us another 500 dollars each for the last minute flight change and only refunded us for the first half of the original trip. They are now refusing to cover the other flights we had to book even though the first customer service representative we talked with while at the airport during this mess told us they would, and have refused to provide any sort of voucher either. While we stood in line at our gate waiting to talk to the Delta attendant for help during all of this, they were giving out 1800 dollar vouchers for an overbooked flight and letting the volunteer passengers cut the line in front of us even though we had already been standing for an hour to rebook their flights.

Our travel agent booked our trip in February 2023 for our upcoming thirty eighth anniversary in August 2023. We arrived early at Atlanta on August 14, 2023. We did everything we were suppose to do, then went to our gate and sat waiting an hour and 15 minutes to board (Gate E15) When they called for Comfort Plus we excitedly got in line to board our flight D1970. When the agent scanned my passport and ticket it would not go through, the agent, who had a horrible attitude asked, where are you flying to?! I stated St. Lucia, she said they changed the flight to boarding gate E10 and the plane has already left. My husband and I were furious because nothing was announced, nor was our name called to let us know of the last minute change. My husband attempted to ask the Delta Rep when did the flight change? She rudely stated, I don't know sir. All I know is the flight gate was changed to E10, they were to depart at 9:45 am, but they departed earlier. My husband asked, what time did they depart? She stated at 9:43 sir. Please move out of the line. We missed our flight. We went to the Delta desk and the agent was no better. We advised her of what had happened and she said, I don't see that your flight was changed to another gate? She then kept looking and said, oh yeah, at the last minute they changed it, and you and your wife are listed as a no show. By this time we are heartbroken. We asked if there was another flight going out? She responded not today. We called our travel agent and she got a Delta Rep on the line for Delta Vacations and she was very unsympathetic. Our travel agent kept asking what could we do to fix this? The agent stated for us to go back to the Delta desk and see if they could book us on an other flight. We again advised we were told there were no more flights going out. We went back to the Delta help desk and the agent had the nerve to say: I don't know why they sent you back to me. They can see the same thing I can. She repeated that statement six times before saying there was nothing she could do. We called for a shuttle to return us back to our hotel, having to pay another $167 plus tax. Our travel agent was able to get us booked on the next day flight August 15, 2023 (this is our anniversary day).

I had delays on BOTH trips (on 8/3 and 8/13). On my first round I traveled a red eye so I slept for most of the flight, did not eat or drink anything. When I woke up I asked the flight attendant if I could have water as she was making her trash pick up rounds. It was approximately 25-30 minutes before our landing time so I told her 'no rush' since I knew she was making her rounds. She looked at me and said, 'we're about to land'. I am a frequent flyer and I have NEVER been made to feel uncomfortable for a cup of water. I responded with, 'you know what, it's fine. I don't need it.' Another flight attendant brought me a cup once she was done with her rounds. Seriously, that's all she needed to do. I made her job easy through the entire flight by knocking out and staying out of her way until I needed ONE cup of water 30 MINUTES before landing. This is the last time I book with Delta. I gave them an extra star because the other flight attendants were cool but if you're going to delay my flight AND treat me like I'm bothering you when I ask for water you won't see me in those planes again. Also, they promote on flight entertainment yet have no bluetooth option for people with earbuds and you don't offer earphones in order to use the entertainment option you claim to offer. It makes zero sense. I had to resort to playing games since I had no old school earphones that plug into YOUR device. I'm glad I wore comfortable shoes b/c they changed gates AT LEAST 5 times when I waited in Atlanta and twice when I waited in Minneapolis. Like come on guys, we're paying tons of money for a service and I flew the lowest level. I would have been PO'd if I paid for First or Business class! Lastly, the on flight WiFi was so bad that I didn't use it after all. I contacted customer service to get into the online account before my flight on 8/3 and have not heard back from anyone.

2023-08-14,1,10,"""over 15 hours of delays""",M Baker,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely the worst flight experience ever! We do not recommend Delta. We booked our flight to fly my bf to GA to haul my RV with my truck to TN (job change) while I drove the car and had limited time to get it moved and get him back in time to make his flight for offshore work. So we opted for flying rather than driving to save time. That is not what happened. What was supposed to be 4.5 hours of travel time, including layover, turned into 19+ hours of travel due to Delta’s over 15 hours of delays. You read this right (we could have drove from LA to GA then to our final destination TN in less time than it took Delta to fly him). They had multiple delays (starting with staffing deficiencies). They left him stranded multiple times, literally, both at the airport with shuttle buses down for the night then left him stranded on a plane for over 6 more hours in delays, a detour to Savannah, more delays, refuelling more than once, before finally arriving 15 hours past his booked arrival time. This put us in terrible position and struggling with time constraints, put us in daytime traffic jams, and eventually having to rebook his return flight when we ran out of time due to Deltas unacceptable 15+ hours in delays. It cost us $135 more (taxi cost when stranded at the airport unable to get to the hotel and $100 in fees to rebook the return flight when we ran out of time due to Delta’s multiple extended delays) an enormous amount of stress, aggravation, and lost time. Delta’s offer to resolve this, a pathetic $40 flight voucher! This is not acceptable. We were not able to speak to a person and instead was forced to text, which added to the stress and aggravation. Worst customer service program we have had the displeasure to have to work through. We understand delays can happen but over 15 hours of multiple delays for such a short flight and leaving people stranded multiple times is unreasonable and unacceptable. If you actually want to make it to your destination and have any reasonable customer service, take your business elsewhere.

Like clockwork they provide outstanding customer service and lost all my bags every time! I flew from ATL to Boston Logan and they failed to load my bag on my flight. Like the professionals Delta are, it was loaded on the next flight an hour behind.  I was disappointed to hear I would be receiving my bag relatively quickly since it was on the next flight. However, my hopes were lifted when Delta told me it would take three days for them to deliver the bag a whopping 2 hour drive from Boston Logan to Hanover, NH. Thank goodness for Delta’s initiative or else I would’ve had to do a presentation in different clothes from those I’d worn the past two days! And I loved how unbelieving they were in my testimony when I tried to get them to compensate me for the clothes I had to buy because of their failure, absolutely beautiful. I was inspired by Deltas commitment to faithful customers, hard work, and service when I was flying from Atlanta to Boston and then to Lisbon for a vacation. Even when a storm came through ATL and they couldn’t seemingly find a crew to fly the plane they delayed my flight and made me wait for 3 extra hours. Lo and behold this delay would cause me to miss my connection in Boston, but no worries the Delta receptionist were available and attentive to my plight. They helped me reschedule my flight to Amsterdam. And they even remembered to forget that my bags had to be moved onto the new plane. I know when I fly Delta they have and deserve my utmost confidence in losing my bags. I wouldn’t receive these bags for the next two days and honestly it ruined the first half of my vacation. Obviously Delta will bear no shame in destroying my vacation. After I thought all was good they do something really great. I mean this just goes to show you the dedication they have to being a top tier airline. After they lose all 7 of my bags flying to Lisbon they actually don’t lose my bags coming back to New York. I was disappointed to hear my bags had landed in JFK. But upon waiting through my two hour layover I soon began to realize the baggage carousel wasn’t going to move.  I wait there for two hours waiting for my bags to come through the claim so that I could recheck them for my flight home. Guess what, they never came. So as I sit here on board a Delta flight back home, without my bags, I have come to be truly amazed by Deltas intelligence, dedication, and service. Guess I’ll go home and wait 2-3 more days before I have any of my bags. It’s okay though I don’t have anything to do. Delta should just take my bags and give the clothes and items to their staff.

It was not until I arrived at the airport for check in that I was told there was a $300 fee ($150 each way) for the unaccompanied minors. I have sent them on other airlines without this charge. In addition to that, the return flight was booked as the last flight out. It’s Delta policy that they cannot take the last flight in case something happened and the minors were stranded. Makes complete sense, but again we were not informed of this issue when the DELTA agent booked it for us. This caused us to reschedule to another day, waste trips and parking fees to the airport, and take another day off work. So a rundown of surprise expenses due to the inept booking agent: Minor fee- $300 Airport parking- $30 Gas and taking time off work- $$ The airport agents were extremely understanding but limited with what they could offer.

Upon arrival in Detroit I received a notification that our flight would be delayed until 02:30. It was subsequently delayed two more times I believe, and then as we were preparing to board at nearly 03:00 the flight was canceled due to the pilot calling off or something to do with the pilot. Several Delta flights that night were delayed or canceled and I heard staffing mentioned by personnel for at two other gates. There were not other flights going out due to it being 3am and no other flights to Buffalo until approximately 36 hours later. I think there were only 3-4 Delta personnel in the airport to assist us but none of them could really help. I actually felt bad for them as they were taking a lot of grief from some very frustrated people. I connected with Delta at one of their service phones and was not really given any options and asked for a refund on my tickets so I could try to find alternate transport for my family of 6. I was told I would get $60 per ticket due to us completing the first leg of the trip (Orlando to Detroit). That was the morning of 7/22. It is 8/9/23 now and after a lot of follow up between Delta and the booking company, I am finally getting confirmation of the refund. However, I am only being refunded $32.14 per ticket, not $60. Since Delta could not fulfill their obligation to get my family home, we had to rent a vehicle, drive 6 hours home after spending 7 hours in the airport. I had to return that vehicle the following morning, to Detroit, so another 6 hours on the road. Since there are no one way rentals out of Detroit. I then had to wait approximately 5 hours in the airport to fly back to Buffalo. I was at least able to get my family home ... the new plane ticket cost me about $500 and the rental was around $250 and instead of getting home early Saturday morning, I spent the entire weekend traveling and did not get complete the trip until Sunday night.

We have been using a good $10-20k a month on our card, we pay $550 a year and have never had an upgrade or been treated like a status they claim, no VIP, no Standby upgrades, It’s all a load of hype with no outcomes and only empty hopes and promises. When you call, everyone just passes you on to someone else with no solutions! The accommodations were lacking and unorganized. Waiting in line for 2 hours at an airport after flights were delayed so long we missed our connecting flight, then 4 hours at baggage to wait for missed plane luggage! To finally get our luggage that was damaged, I had no medication for way to long. By 1am we could not find any place to accept the food voucher, there was no shuttle to go to a hotel Delta gave us 30 mins away by the time we finally got a hotel, my bags were damaged and we were promised to be compensated to make up for these troubles and they are not offering anything close to fair. After one hour on the phone, 3 agents, multiple answers, no help, we were passed to the lowest customer service Delta rep I have ever spoke with! This did the final for me, so inexperienced yo handle any situations for a stressed out and upset customer who has been through the loop holes to try to get reimbursed and her attitude was just nasty and rude.  Delta is horrible and don’t listen to the customer, they also are not accommodating to people who have been through a tough time during their DELTA flight issues and especially the after the flight issues. I am not a happy Delta member. We are rethinking our choices, rethinking our membership and which card/company I we should look into because of the whole process of this last month with Delta and how they have been handling our situation is the worst experience I have ever had, ruining our family experience that is so hard to have and put together with our demanding schedules these days of precious time and a waste of my sanity and yearly money.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'First Class', 'Route': 'Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale', 'Date Flown': 'July 2023', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Food & Beverages': 5, 'Inflight Entertainment': 5, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 3, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We left on 7/3 from Boise on a one hour, straight flight to Seattle. When we arrived, we discovered that some how my mother's luggage had been lost. I'm not sure how that can possibly happen on such an easy flight. We had to wait at the Delta baggage claim for 3 1/2 hours for them to finally tell us they would open a case. They had no idea where my mom's bag was. Our plan was to fly into Seattle, get a rental car and drive about 2 1/2 hours away to Ocean Shores. This put us way behind schedule and left my mom with NOTHING - no clothes, no toothbrush, no heart medication. She trusted that Delta would get her bag to its location. For Pete's sake, we weren't taking an international flight with layovers! The next morning Delta called and said they located my mom's bag but that they couldn't deliver it to us because we were too far away and they couldn't ship it via UPS because it was a holiday. By the time Delta would have been able to ship my mom's bag to us, we would have already been returning to the airport at the end of our short vacation. My mom paid to check her bag both ways ($60) just to not have any access to it - plus the stress of not knowing where it was, waiting for hours, and the inconvenience of having none of the items that she brought to accommodate her vacation. She had to spend about $150 of replacement clothes, toothbrush, etc. I contacted Delta after the trip and requested nothing other than that they refund the $60 we paid to check the bag both ways. They would only offer a flight credit good for 12 months.... UNBELIEVABLE. We will not be flying in 12 months so I again asked for a cash refund instead. They refused.

This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed, and we were told at the terminal that it would be ""at least an hour,"" and that it would probably be longer. I went to eat something and came back in an hour, and the plane was gone and the terminal empty. At the Delta desk, I was told it had gone. They said other people missed it as well. Of course, they had announced the flight over the intercom and sent passengers an email, but where I was told it would be ""at least"" an hour, I ate without listening to the many constant announcements or checking my phone. Delta booked me on standby for a flight late that night, but unfortunately did not inform me that it was an overbooked flight. There was no room on that flight. I had to travel late and stay the night in a nearby town and wake up the next morning for another flight, traveling on little sleep. I had to reschedule one of the most exciting meetings of my life with a new mentor. We met that night much more briefly, with me totally frazzled and stressed. So essentially, I spent extra money on food and transportation, lost sleep, missed work, wasted many hours, had to travel late and stay overnight, had a panic attack in the empty terminal, and missed a once-in-a-lifetime meeting with a hero and new mentor of mine. I understand that these things happen and reached out professionally to Delta, and they emailed me apologizing and saying they would add 3,000 miles to my SkyMiles account. Turns out that 3,000 miles are worth about $30. I have seen overbooked Delta flights offer people credit cards for $500 or more, just like that. I lost so much time and money with this experience. I asked if I could talk to someone else, remaining friendly with the individual since I know it's a company policy and customer service staff are not to blame, but the email I got back said, ""Thank you for writing us back.

Before we arrived at the airport, we were constantly checking the Delta app, and it always showed that the flight was on time. When we checked in (3 hours before our flight) the counter person let us know there was a ""slight"" delay. We were in the airport from 5 p.m. until 11 p.m. At 11 p.m. Delta announced that the flight would be delayed until 11 a.m. the next morning. We went back to the counter, and the counter person took quite a while to find a solution that would allow us to arrive at our final destination, Phoenix. We were somewhat confused because other airlines (JetBlue) still had flights that were flying out that night to JFK. The counter person finally found a solution for us. The solution involved sending us to a hotel, where we would spend one night. Then from the hotel, a taxi would pick us up and drive us 5 hours to a completely different airport (Punta Cana.) We did make it to the Punta Cana airport on time and were able to get on a flight to Dallas and connect on to Phoenix. One of the stresses that occurred was that the hotel that the Delta ticket counter person sent us to was full. When we arrived at the hotel at 11 p.m., the hotel manager said that there were no more rooms available. After more than 30 minutes, they were able to squeeze us all in 1 room, with my daughter sleeping on a cot on the floor. The following morning, the taxi driver (that Delta provided) was a very unsafe driver. We were in the taxi with him for 5 hours. He drove all over the road, cars and buses honking at him, he talked on his cell phone, stopped to buy street food, asked us for gum, and when he dropped us off at the airport he asked us for a tip 3 times.

Also on phone, maybe another airport— what about other NYC airports, Newark, Philadelphia, Washington — nothing available. What about flights to any city in Florida and we can drive from there? Nothing? Check the trains, nothing available. Did DELTA have a responsibility to get us home? The airlines answer was NO. Can we take the next available flight to anywhere in Florida? Sure, DELTA tells us that’s in 5 days on Saturday. Hey airlines … we work, we have responsibilities, a life to get home to, our dog… what about that? What about my Medallion status as a loyal customer? No doubt, DELTA airlines stranded us with no options without even an apology. No apology sent to my Delta app, email, nothing! No refund sent to my card either for that matter. In all my decades of air travel, I have never seen anything like this. Delta claims the massive cancellations are due to weather, which they cannot justify on the east coast route. Today still stuck on account of the supposed “bad weather” — there’s no hurricane, tornado or even a thunderstorm. The sun is bright. As of now, we’re driving to Richmond for a flight we found on Jetblue to Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. That’s means 2 days lost just trying to get get home.

They delayed/misplaced one of our check-in bags, the one that had our house keys in it. It was our fault to leave our keys in a checked in bag, trusting the bag would make it to our final destination. But it was almost 24 hours until our bag was returned. We spent the night in a hotel near our house until someone could let us in the next day. Delta is the only airline in my entire history of flying which has lost my luggage .. twice now. They also removed and discarded all of our personal luggage tags. We have no idea why they would do this. Also, on our initial Comfort Plus flight out of the country to London, they cancelled my ticket when I stated I was having a slight allergic reaction to something. This is understandable. But they would not let me fly again without a doctors note stating I could do so. The next day when we tried to book another flight, they charged us an additional $700 each and placed us in the back of Economy. No Comfort Plus seats, which we'd paid for. With the additional $700, this made our tickets $1700 each, one way. Do not fly this airline.

We did so and, upon arriving at the check-in in Detroit, there was no Delta One seat for my wife, and she had an 8 hour flight in coach (I would have traded with her, but I am 6'4"": and could not fit in her seat). We finally made it to Hawaii on a very sour note for our anniversary and when we checked in for our return flight my wife was again in coach.

There is no way to call the Delta agent in Honolulu, and Delta reservations has no control over the flight the 24 hours before the flight.

Now, that line was huge and it took over 30 minutes for my turn. The Asian guy at the checkin counter was the only positive thing about this process. He was smiling and doing his job with the right attitude. I was not assigned a seat because it was a last minute emergency booking. I stood in the line at the boarding area to get one assigned only to be asked to come back later. 20 minutes later, back in the huge line.

I was kept at the counter a long time while the agent and her supervisor searched for a carrier to sell me. They were out and told me I would need to book a later flight while they obtained one. This was not an option because my son was already in Utah. I called my daughter back to the airport to take my cat to my ex as she is unable to keep him. Returned to the counter where the supervisor loudly told the ticket agent to find out what I had ""done""with the cat. I checked two bags one being my son's camping gear where the supervisor informed the ticket agent that my sons rod and reel couldn't be in his pack and security would determine if I could carry it with me. It was only a $100 rod but had tremendous sentimental value. Security said it was fine and people take fishing trips with their gear. I made it to the gate (I was over 2 hours early) after it had already boarded and the supervisor met me there to inform me that she herself would not allow me to board with the rod. I put the rod in garbage can (she continued to argue for a later flight while they ""obtained"" another carrier). All together this 4 hour one way economy flight cost me around $1200 and I was made to choose between my son and my best friend of over 8 years.

Connecting in Salt Lake City both ways. Initial flight leaving PDX was substantially delayed so rebooked, same routing. That flight was just a little late, had plenty of time in SLC, no problem. Especially since THAT flight was substantially delayed. Got in to DFW 6 hours later than planned. Return flight, delayed just enough that the only flight to be on time, the last leg, taking me home, was already pushed back when I got to the gate. Delta kindly rebooked me on a flight the next day and of course, no room. Fortunately the gate agent found a seat on a flight later that evening so I only have to wait 5 hours. I assume they used the same computer and data base that Delta Corporate uses, so I am not sure why the company didn't book me there in the first place. Going back a few months, I had a flight get delayed and delayed and then finally they sent me a text that it was delayed until the next morning. Same scenario, no help for accommodations and since they ""delayed"" it, well that's not the same as ""cancelled"" so they have no obligation to help or refund. In that case, I had to be in the destination city before the flight was scheduled to depart so I rented a car and drove all night. I only flew Delta this time because they were a ""preferred airline"" for the corporate travel department I was booking through. I cannot fathom why. Now, the staff at Delta are all very nice, they are as helpful as they can be, but there isn't much they can do when flights are delayed. So thanks to the staff. But your airline sucks.

We shoved his stuffed animal and my Fanny pack into a bag and then she said my mothers purse which was smaller than my Fanny pack was a bag then grabbed one of our rolling bags and told the other woman working there to “check it in”. She said “you’ll get it when you get off” then pushed us through. The guy behind us who was on the flight explained since it’s a connecting flight we would pick it up at the turnstile in Albany.

Second, Delta Airlines changed my entire trip without notifying me. I found out my flight changed the next day from my travel agent. Delta changed my entire trip and made me use their airline to fly back to China instead of flying with China Airlines. The new trip now forced me to fly to Seattle and then fly to China through Delta Airlines. This forced me to stay in a hotel for 2 nights and the 2nd night hotel I had to pay out of pocket. Third, Delta Airlines then tried to make me purchase a Main Cabin class ticket for the 3rd day flight to China on their Airlines. This was an $800 ticket which they said I have to purchase in in order to get on the only next available flight to China. So, for them making me miss my connecting flight I had to pay $800 just to fly back and also I had to spend $200 the second night for a hotel in Seattle so I can catch the flight to China the 3rd day is ridiculous. Finally, when I took their flight to China on the third day and arrived in China they lost my luggage. I had important items in my luggage which I had to give to my relatives and now its gone and they are still trying to find it.

We booked premium economy after looking at reviews. I've travelled Premium economy with Air Canada once previously. Sydney to LA was very comfortable with the foot rest and ample room. The seats go back far enough for me to sleep quite well. We received a menu and could choose from 2-3 options at dinner and breakfast. There were different wines to choose from as well. Food was great and it was so nice to eat off plates with proper cutlery and not be knocking elbows. The flights from LA to Mexico City and Cabo to LA were also great. What we didn't realise that because we had booked Premium Economy on our main legs we were in comfort class on the shorter flights. More room, designated cabin storage and choice of snacks. So that was a nice surprise. On our return flight from LA to Sydney there was a marked difference in the quality and choice of food and wine. We had a two choices for main one being vegetarian and no choice for breakfast. The dessert was a small slice. I asked for some fruit but none as forthcoming until breakfast. There was only one white wine offered that being Chardonnay which I don't like. Delta advertises wine and food choices for premium economy and did not deliver on the LA to Sydney leg. We did get noise cancelling headphones to use which was good but just be aware you cant use them with your devices only the entertainment provided so you still may want to bring your own. Also internet did not work LA to Sydney but did Sydney to LA. The amenity bags from LA to Sydney included out of date lotions and vouchers. No access to the lounge which United does include in its premium economy offers. Our return flight was changed to a 7 hour wait in LA so it would have been nice to have had lounge access for something that was not our fault. The Sydney to LA flight was late leaving and we had a 2 hour window to collect our bags , recheck them and get to another terminal to catch our flight to Mexico City. Luckily customs was quick but the baggage carousel stopped and needed a maintenance person. It didn't look like we were going to make it. I know Delta would have to book us onto the next available flight if we missed our flight due to no fault of our own but that does create booking problems. As we ran to the gate the boarding closed sign was up but previous passengers had told them we were on our way and we were able to board. Just! There was no allowance or help given by Delta for something they were responsible for. In hindsight a 2 hour time frame does not take into account any delays so a 3 hour window would be much less stressful or stay overnight in LA. Overall the flight was good, especially Sydney to LA. As we have gotten older we have decided to travel in more comfort and Premium Economy does supply that.

The reason for the cancellation wasn’t weather related rather it was because they are understaffed and didn’t have a crew to man the plane. From what I was told and read online it’s due to Delta forcing the vaccine on their employees and the employees either resigning or are fired. Their choice of compensation was issuing 10,000 miles which is essentially $100. This cancelation forced us to miss Easter with the rest of family.

To start, every passenger made it on time but the pilot caused about an hour delay because he didn’t show up and we had to sit and wait after boarding for Delta to find another pilot. If you know the captain isn’t here or running late don’t squish everyone onto your cramped plane. Then I happen to be sitting next to the emergency exit and was trying to make sure I had the procedure of opening the emergency door solely by the illustration in the pamphlet when the delta lady butted into my conversation with my wife to correct me by mentioning the door will open itself after lifting the lever and I would go with it if I was still holding onto it. I jokingly said I guess I’d be the first off. Apparently her sense of humor is poor because then she threatens to move my seat and gets short with me. She said not to be snarky but she takes her job seriously. That’s fine I get taking you job seriously but learn how to communicate better and don’t come across like such a bitch maybe. That FA completely ruined my flight back home with her nasty attitude. I bit my tongue to avoid it coming to a situation like I’ve seen only on social media where police come escort passengers off the plane. After my little run in with the lady in 13d (your employee) I can almost understand how those situations arise. Oh yeah, and they charged us for our luggage for our flight there and our flight back. My wife used her delta American Express and was informed when checking our bags that we shouldn’t have had to pay.

The flight was to leave at 6:15 in the evening but around 530 we were told that there was a weather problem and would be delayed until 7 o’clock. At about 6:55 they change the delayed time to 720 and the plane started to load and was completed by about 730 or 735 and we left the gate headed to the runway. While on the runway we got ready to take-off but then the engines were cut back and we returned to the gate. They said that the weather had closed and they couldn’t take-off , they also said that they had been notified that the pilots time has run out and that they would have to have new pilots so we sat on the plane for about an hour and a half until the new pilot got there. They said they were having problems getting clearance to leave the gate, but by the time they did surprise, the attendant time had run out and now we had to wait another hour while they found new staff. We finally left at about 1030 getting us home at about 1210 where we should’ve been home a little after eight I don’t understand how they couldn’t see the time running out coming for both the pilot and the crew well before it was the time to leave it just seems like poor management. I could understand the weather problem, but the pilots time running out within minutes of taking off doesn’t seem to make much sense and then the attendance time runs out like nobody knew that was coming very very unhappy with that situation.

A glorified bus ride. What’s more upsetting is the whole “going green” charade to cut cost on elements that are so fundamental to the passenger such as food. They provide meals with this sort of pre-packaged configuration where you get useless wood silverware that makes eating completely difficult. Lack of trays makes eating a super annoying task. The portions are a joke for a 10 hours flight, and breakfast is just replica of the American “beef pockets”.

I arrive at Columbus airport and I see that my flight is already delayed by 15 minutes. But as you know how it is, of course it was more than 15 minutes. It was more like 30 minutes delayed. And then there was more delay inside the plane once we were waiting to take off. Those delays landed me in Atlanta well past My time to board my connection flight to Florida which caused me to misconnect. The best they could do was get me book me onto another flight that was taking off two hours later which got me into Tampa at two twenty in the morning. But there's more before that flight even took off. They kept getting the gates wrong for which gate the plane was going to be boarding out of. We literally were playing back-and-forth, back-and-forth from to 2 different Gates. Each time I did this I had to take a train. I took that very train that went between gates A and B four times that night. After getting into Tampa so late I had to book a hotel nobody was going to be able to pick me up. There are no Ubers even running. Now are you ready for the return back? Same thing happened again in Atlanta. I had a misconnect Once again and the plane leaving from Tampa to Atlanta sat on the runway before leaving for 20 some minutes again. And then when we landed in Atlanta it took fifteen minutes to taxi to the gate. I was very concerned that what happened to me coming to Florida was happening again and I told the flight attendant. I'm pretty sure i'm going to miss this flight unless you guys are able to do something she assured me all you have plenty of time and dismissed it like it was nothing. Sure enough I left missed the flight because when I got finally out of there. My connection fight was already boarding and the gate.

The staff were extremely rude and unprofessional, blaming me for the issue and providing absurd explanations for their inability to resolve the problem, to the extent that the employee at gate B37 had my luggages removed from the plane, closed the gate door in front of me and harshly asked me if had the intention of just be staying at a closing gate or if I’d rather go to the customer service counter to get help. Once I got to the counter, I was told that I had purchased my ticket through Alitalia, which could not be true as the company does exist anymore and turned into a different legal entity and then insinuated that I had firstly purchased a ticket for a different day and then modified the date, which in reality never happened. They even instructed me to contact my travel agency for assistance, as the problem was not on them, which was not helpful at all, as I had booked my ticket through the Italian lastminute.com website months before, since I studied and lived in the US for 3 months, and due to the time zone differences their help desk would have been closed. Regardless booking the ticket through a different website and not directly through the airline, I still received a confirmation number both from lastminute.com and Delta, together with and email from Delta reminding me of the imminent flight and the check-in opening. As far as I understand that system errors might happen, it should not be on the customer to solve such issues, as I own the right to board as long as I have payed, received confirmation, and I am able to check in at the airline counter without problems. Furthermore, it was not imaginable for me that the ticket did not exist according to the boarding system, as it was easily recognised by the check in counter and, once again, I had received confirmation of the booking. To make matters worse, I was forced to wait for two hours at the customer service desk before being booked on the next flight, without even receiving an apology, only 20 minute before the opening of the gate. When I asked confirmation of my luggages being take cared of, or if I needed to checked them in again, I was answered that they would’ve handled it. Unfortunately, my suitcases were not boarded and were gave back to me only three days later.

After 5 hours wait at the original gate 32, we missed the flight.

The lady at Delta that open the door in Boston barely acknowledge my issue with 25 min to my next international flight and gave me the wrong directions to a bus that was closed for the day 30 min prior to the plane landing. Unprofessional and extremely rude and uninterested in my travel. I had 2 international connections booked with Delta for KLM flights and Delta did not care to even acknowledge anything about those flights. No tickets were issues - as if I would have bought them on my own. Extremely frustrating.

I reached out to Delta to confirm my seats. At that point I was told that I needed one more pass to have first class seats for my round trip travel. I was told the young lady that I purchased the tickets in June and I have my tickets showing my travel in first class and my seat assignments for the round trip. I was passed along from agent to agent and finally I was told that the agent who booked the trip made a mistake and I would either have to pay $1,100 or 150,000 air miles to use the ticket that I had printed out.

The flight is a total of 90 minutes! This is so far the worst experience I’ve had with Delta. They are quick to not spite you to board if past boarding time but this extraordinary wait for no reason is unbelievable. An hours ago they said it was the water and we just would not have coffee.

Delta offered me an unacceptable alternative – to return March 6, 2023. I had to get back March 5 – and incurred a 1500 dollar expense and major inconvenience to do so, additionally I had to be picked up in Detroit (at 11:30 PM) and driven back to Lansing as the DTW to Lansing flight was missed; I received an email from customer care requesting I submit receipts for costs incurred in Delta cancelling my flight – which I did this AM. They offered to reimburse me 57 dollars. Additionally in communication with the customer care rep I was admonished for emailing and asking to have this escalated to someone who could make a decision on reimbursement.

We had boarded the plane, by that time, a crew member timed out. We were de-boarded because ""Delta cant have you on the plane for 3 hours (probably because they'd have to refund us at that time) and we were told ""there is another crew member on standby at the lounge. They should be here in about 10 minutes"" - an hour later, still no crew member. By the time the replacement crew member got to us, a pilot had to be replaced due to their time being up as well. Another hour or so later, another plane pulled up to the next gate and we inherited their crew and pilots. Finally boarded again, and after 30 min on the tarmack, were told the plane needed fuel so we were waiting for a fuel truck. An hour later we were waiting on a fuel slip after the truck was done and we were good to depart. Absolutely ridiculous experience. I paid almost $1000 for this trip and specifically chose delta because this experience isn't typical to them. In hindsight, i should have flown another airline. I probably would have had a similar experience with Spirit, but it would have only cost me half of what delta did.  One more addition. My return flight was delayed due to ""mechanical issue"" which was later described in an email from delta as ""damage to the aircraft"" - on that flight customers were offered $800 to switch to a later flight.

The first issue was on February 18, 2023 with our Delta One flight from Atlanta when we had to sit on the plane for over an hour because of some unknown maintenance issues before taking off late. Once we landed at Kahului, HI airport we sat on the tarmac for two hours before pulling up to the gate to unload. We were told by the pilot the reason was we had such a strong tailwind arriving early (not the case) along with many planes ahead of us that needed unloaded too. Thus, everyone had to sit on this plane for over 13 hours! On February 25, 2023 on our return Flight from Maui, HI we boarded the plane 1.5 hours later than scheduled because our plane had been sitting out on the tarmac for some reason waiting to pull up the the gate delaying our take-off by this long. When we boarded our Flight in Atlanta to return to Cleveland we sat in the plane for 1.5 hours being told by the pilot there were maintenance issues and ultimately had to add more fuel to the plane and waiting for the fuel truck to arrive with no estimated time being provided by anyone. All of these delays seem to be preventable by improvements in customer service i.e., better communications and your maintenance practices such as fuelling planes needs improved.

Again, the 3rd flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight by 10-15 minutes again, and again Delta was unwilling to hold the plane.

It is now 11:25am and Delta representatives has given me the push around all morning except for one young who has been trying his best to help us. We call the Delta line about twenty times and when we do got somebody they put us on hold for four hours. My son who’s birthday we are celebrating is still waiting for someone from Delta’s headquarters to answer the phone. Mind you we are holding for four hours now and I am not exaggerating. We just cannot delete with the continual push around so we endeavor to stay online no matter how long they have us to wait. Our family friends who is celebrating twenty seven years of marriage has already miss much of their activities for their celebration. We are now trying to get to San Juan because we cannot connect with the ship in Orlando anymore, so we have to connect in San Juan and we are still having the run around. No one has even come to us to offer some sought of comfort. There’s one young who has been doing whatever he can but he still needs his supervisors approval and he is having the round around as well. Delta is a disappointment and a public disgrace. No one should ever flight with this airline again.

They told me the bag would arrive an hour later that night and it would be delivered after. Then the man at the desk calls me 20 min after I left the airport and tells me it’s actually going to arrive the following night at 10 pm. That flight gets canceled and I am told it is going to arrive the next day. That flight also gets canceled. I call delta and try to get a timeframe for delivery and the representative hangs up on me. Then I call again and tell them to reroute the bag to Norfolk, Virginia where I’m spending Christmas with my family. I texted the rep again using the Delta texting service to ensure it was going there. They said it was going to ORF airport and that there was no update in the system yet. I woke up today Sat Dec 24th to find out my bag is now going from ATL-CLE on DL 1355 even though I specifically instructed Delta two times over the phone and text service to deliver it to Norfolk, Virginia. Now I’m leaving for my trip to Norfolk, VA and I don’t think my bag is going to get delivered on time. I am without gifts, clothes, and all other belongings and Delta has ruined the holidays for me.

I’m assuming the people on the grounds are also working as hard as they can. But you as a company suck. You have over-extended yourself and make promises to customers that you never follow through with and you believe that your vouchers and your credits will make it better. I don’t travel a ton. In fact, maybe once a year, but I am seasoned. I have never flown Delta until this time to Hawaii from Denver. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Delta behaved like it never knew any type of weather existed or knowledge of the workings of an airport. I understand there are always going to be limitations. I have been through delays but nothing like this. My first delay from this trip was due to weather from another city - fine. But it was delayed even further because when we were got to Seattle, there wasn’t a loading bridge that could unload us from the airplane - it was coming from the S gate to the A gate and the pilot didn’t know why. We missed our flight to Hawaii by 10 minutes and couldn’t get one until the next day. If you don’t have the workers/materials or have the workings of the flight even if delayed planned out, don’t make these promises that you can get us there. Do your due diligence and make sure things are running smoothly at the airports you do business at. The next day when we flew out of Seattle to Hawaii - they had to taxi us back due to mechanical issues. After about 45 minutes, I thanked the mechanics after they departed and we were off. Better safe than sorry for this delay. And now that I’m thinking about it, this was Hawaiian airlines. I do have to say when we did land in Hawaii that day, the luggage people at Delta went way beyond my expectations! It was waiting at their customer service office. Coming home from the LA airport was also a terrible experience. We were of course delayed (no reason given) which was fine but when we were all boarded, we were having issues with the push off tug and we were delayed another hour because we had to wait for another one then when we finally made it to Denver at around 11:30, we had to sit on the plane for two hours with really no true explanation as to why. There were two planes that passed us by & they both went to their unloading gate. I understand weather, I understand shortages of workers but Delta acted as if does not. Don’t offer flights if you can’t follow through to just attempt to get us to the gate in a timely manner. Again the employees were top notch except for your customer service via chat - they couldn’t do nearly as much as when we waited in line for two hours to talk to a human which I’ll never understand why either - my questions were the same. Bottom line, Delta don’t make promises to your customers you never planned to keep.

When I saw the Delta representative arrive to the gate I approached the counter said Good morning and asked how she was doing? Delta CSR response - what do you need, I explained that I needed my seat selected and asked if I could have one of the comfort seats. She stated no and continued to look at the monitor about 15 seconds of silence passed before I asked if there was a reason why. She stated in a very negative tone while rolling her eyes you purchased coach so you don't get to upgrade for free. I tried to explain it would not give me the option to upgrade to comfort because only available seats were blocked by the airline, I told Delta's CSR she could see that I did purchase comfort on my connecting flight. I asked could I pay the difference for the comfort seat. She stated you would need to repurchase a whole new ticket and I would not be reimbursed for the existing one. I then asked may I have row 36 seat C, she never responded never looked up just continued as if I never asked a question but took several deep breaths every few seconds. Again another 15-20 seconds of silence then she says I'm printing your new ticket. Delta's CSR decided to select a different seat with no explanation, she handed me the ticket and said next.

In total it took about two hours which made me arrive at the gate by the time they had started boarding. Once I entered the plane I was greeted by the cabin crew, there was a blanket and pillow in every seat and prior to take-off I was provided with headphones. About 50 minutes into the flight you could choose from a cheese plate or chicken salad sandwich along with beer, wine or non-alcoholic drinks. I was offered an extra meal since I asked for one which was good. Inflight entertainment was excellent. The only bad thing was the tray table was broken on my seat. Hour and a half prior to landing there was another drink service. One thing I didn’t see which I usually do on Delta is a water service halfway through the flight.

What is the point to get to a lounge that is ""at capacity""? With all the news I heard recently, this seems to be a chronic issue rather than an unexpected situation. Delta did not do any upgrade on its A330-200, meaning the Delta One seat was very old. It was relatively comfortable, but it was worn out with virtually no storage space. I think the most basic part of a business class flat bed seat is a small, secured storage space so passengers can put away small items like eye glasses, wallets and phones while sleeping.

Didn’t bother me much because it was a short flight. A longer flight would have been a different story.

Apparently he had to pay MORE miles to move the day, for the exact same change I received credit for. The explanation was that prices are subject to change at any time, but since it was the same time it made no sense. So anyway, I can't help but believe they gouge prices when redeeming miles.

Here is what you actually get for all of that extra money you spent: You get the most awful selection of alcohol you ever want to consume! Wine in a can that is so bitter that you cannot take more than 3 tiny sips, if you can stomach that much. I really want to know...hey Delta where are the upgraded snacks? Because they were not on any of our 6 (indeed I said 6 flights!) Also I was freezing and according to the Delta website under ""COMFORT PLUS"" it clearly says complimentary pillow and blanket! When I asked my flight attendant for the little pillow and blanket, she looked at me like I was from another planet and said: ""We don't have any pillows or blankets Ma'am"". Just in case anyone should want to know our flights were on: Wednesday, September 21st, 2022. The first flight was Delta# 2836 going from Billings to Minneapolis, the second was Delta#2089 going from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, the third was Delta #0370 going to Hawaii. The fourth was Delta #DL523 going from Kona Hawaii to Los Angeles, the fifth was Delta #DL1145  going from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and the final flight was Delta #3817 back to Billings.

We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years with different Airlines. On December, 18th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time. Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. I’m willing to bet that due to extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and allowed the plane to take off. Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY.  When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the employee “You knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didn’t you wait for just 2 minutes? She did not answer, but again it’s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going to miss our flight to Israel as well. I don’t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening that we would have to wait for (if I’m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do whatever needed to be done. She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes, but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he already had a boarding pass, but because of Delta’s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3 flights. All they needed to do was transfer his boarding pass to the next flight. However, this process was also taking long.

Waiting at the gate for the last leg of my trip, a flight from Atlanta to Kansas City, two female employees at the gate counter acted like they were in a high school girl's bathroom - cackling and laughing like witches over the intercom mike while blurting out info about boarding the flight. I'd never heard such juvenile and unprofessional behavior before, and the whole time I asked myself why would a company hire these characters. Pickings must be extremely slim. The flight attendants at the front of the plane waiting as I boarded the plane were no better. The male-female duo were rating the looks of passengers as they came on board: ""That's a two"" said the female. ""No, that's a one and a half"" said the male attendant. Naturally, as usual, they were two extremely gorgeous specimens who had plenty to say about other people in the looks department, like most of these extremely rude types of characters do.

I found some flights that worked for my schedule and they happened to be Delta whom I do not typically choose as travel partners. I had coordinated plans with people based on my itinerary but unfortunately found out, that when flying with Delta, a set schedule is always subject to change and your efforts to be a dependable person in regard to your commitment is jeopardized with their great ineptitude of being a reliable transportation service. It might be easiest to understand my disappointment and frustration by simply looking at the attachments of the update texts. From all of my other travel experiences, which I am fortunate and grateful to say is plenty and well above average, I usually receive 1-2 update texts mostly with confirmations of flight and gate information. Delta operates differently than their competitors however as they like to send 10-12 texts with new gate information and change of departure times. For those who like spontaneous adventures, simply book a flight with Delta and you'll be running around the airport all day with changes of departure times every 30-45 minutes! Unfortunately due to all of this irresponsible and unreliable service from Delta, I held many people up and changed a lot of people's schedules simply bc I didn't know when I was going to get in. Eventually plans were canceled and I, with the help of Delta Airlines, ruined a night of fun which was planned a long time in advance.

Believe me, I'm not holding my breath! In summary though, Delta has proven to me that it is a completely unreliable travel service with little to no regard nor respect for it's customer's time nor plans.

However, I have a few suggestions for some of their hubs: they could stand to work with the Atlanta airport authority to modernize ATL and enforce standards of cleanliness, to update the airport from 1999 to the modern era and to make it a truly world-class airport rather than the busiest. Delta has the onus since Atlanta is their headquarters and primary global hub, and nearly 75% of all passengers arriving into and departing from Atlanta are using Delta. Delta should also work with the Seattle airport authority for the same thing. A significant share of passengers in Seattle also use Delta, as they are the airline's hub for the Northwest.",yes,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'San Antonio to Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'September 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Food & Beverages': 3, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 2, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

I saw nothing that seemed to apply to me, so along with other passengers I trekked up the 4 flights to the desk, where I was promptly rejected and told to leave. It turns out that they now require you to have an American Express card, and I was offered the chance to apply, or get out. So I left- I don't want or need more credit cards in my life. Don't get me wrong either, the staff were friendly and professional, and obviously caught in the crappy position of rejecting formerly qualified customers. I don't care that they changed the rules, business is business. I do mind that I was publicly embarrassed when it could have simply been posted at the door. I sat in the concourse nearby to see if it was happening to others and counted 12 other passengers who entered, and came back out looking embarrassed and/or angry. Is it Delta's policy to subject their employees to angry, surprised, embarrassed passengers? And is it their policy to make us resent flying with them? Because that's what's happening with this arbitrary oversight. Put updated signs on the doors, save us all some headaches.

The gate agent, flight attendant, and the pilot all spoke and decided to open up the doors for me to board. They obviously did not have to do that and it is unheard of. It was at the end of their shift and they could have handled the situation a million different ways, but instead decided to bless me and extend grace to me for my mistake.

Wheel broken off suitcase and deep gouge in fabric. Obviously mishandled. Okay - this happens. The next day I was about 200 miles away in Denali and tried to file a claim by phone. Tried to make a claim by website. Totally impossible. I was on various forms of chat for almost an hour. Kept getting rerouted to various departments most of whom turned out to be robot computers - they sound good at first, till you finally figure out they are not real people and they tell you essentially your question is beyond them. At one point I got a person who was nice but she went off shift before anything resolved. Going in circles. Finally gave it up as an impossible quest. At one point was told all I could do was file a complaint as I did not report it at the airport - at 2am. My time is worth more than this or the suitcase, which was not even new and for which I would have settled for maybe $75. Left a very bad taste. Especially since I was on vacation. I am 87 years old and was at the start of a solo 16 day journey through Alaska by car - having a suitcase that won't roll and that I can't pick up is very stressful - I just left it in the boot of the car.

Short, snippy, and sarcastic, the agent seemed to want to have very little to do with us from the minute we stepped to the counter. No smile, no hello, no greeting. And it was all downhill from there. We had been planning for my son to participate in a foreign exchange program for a year and a half. Made all the arrangements, did all the research, and checked all the boxes. We chose Delta because they had an arrival time inside of a time window we needed to meet. Simple enough. He is a minor. He is old enough to opt out of the Delta Unaccompanied Minor program, where they charge an extra $150 and require someone at the destination to jump through a bunch of hoops to pick him up. The host organization already had a process in place. We researched the unaccompanied minor rules and regulations. The host organization would have someone waiting to meet with him at the gate in Japan. No problem. We chose to opt out of the unaccompanied minor program because the Delta website rules specifically state: https://www.delta.com/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program ""If I decline the Unaccompanied Minor Service for my 15-17 year old, can I still accompany them to the gate? Yes. If you are dropping off or picking up your minor but opted out of the Unaccompanied Minor program, we will issue you a pass to accompany your child to the gate. Please check with an airport agent at the time of check-in to have the gate pass issued."" We arrive at the ticket counter to begin the process and the agent is visibly annoyed that she now has to go through all of this process first thing in the morning (visa, passport, covid test verification, etc) and she makes it very clear through her body language and attitude that she is annoyed. Then we get to the part where I request a pass to accompany my son to his gate. She responds ""No. He's old enough to travel by himself."" I mention the rules we had researched, and after some tense back and forth, she says ""no, we're not Southwest."" Now, tensions are escalating and my son is upset. She even walks away at one point to go do something else that seemed completely unrelated to us. I know if I escalate any further, I run the risk of expulsion from the airport, so we take our boarding pass and move away. My son is very upset at this point and asks if there is anything else we can do. We get back in line to try a different agent. This one is even worse. I opened the discussion with a recap of our previous encounter and even showed her the Delta website I had pulled up on my phone. She looks right at it and says the only thing she can do is enroll him in the unaccompanied minor program. So I say, ""ok, let's do that."" She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump. She leans forward, places her hands face down on the counter looks up with her head cocked to the side and says ""fine. But I'm going to need a lot of information."" She has us fill out a form which is quite comprehensive, then starts pausing at every other word to ask if the spelling is correct. The process drags on so long, and the tension was so uncomfortable, that my son asks if we can just go. I express to them that the amount of trouble to go through this when the rules clearly state that it should amount to a simple request is ridiculous. So my son started his trip alone.

2022-06-27,2,10,"""ground staff is indifferent""",Harmeet Singh,"Not Verified |  Mobile App did not allow check-in. Did not show connecting flight. Did not provide information whom to contact in case you need assistance. I called the agent, wait was for 34 minutes. So, I opted for a call back. Did not hear from them in next 2 hours, while I was waiting at the check-in counter. Conclusion: Delta do not provide any assistance. Operations is the critical component of their business. I would care less if an airline avoids delays and disruptions (except in cases of extreme weather). For an international traveller, it is not east to navigate airports, or make alternative arrangements in a foreign country, that too in a situation where airport staff speaks language other than yours'. While booking the DeltaOne, my agent warned me that delta flights are often delayed. I gave it a shot nevertheless. And true to their reputation, Flight was delayed by 44 minutes in App, 1 hour at the checkin counter and 2 hours at departure. As First flight was delayed, I missed my connecting flight. The options I was given were: Fly by different carrier. But I have to claim baggage, go through security and checkin again. Catch is to do it in 1hour 15 minutes!  Wait at the airport for next flight (that was exactly after 12 hours and downgraded from business to economy).Leave my check-in bag with Delta and pick it up on return flight ! This made me really furious. I wonder if Delta and its partner has any sensitivity. So, I chose option b. And adding insult to injury, I was given 15 Euro complimentary food coupons. Talk about customer care. Delta is not transparent in their conduct or concerned about customer experience.  Ground Staff the most pathetic staff I ever witnessed.  The lady in-charge of ground affairs was outright rude. Did not even listen. I kept pleading for details, but she said she would help me later. I felt a bit arrogance in her attitude. And I did not understand where the staff kept disappearing intermittently. For two and a half hours that I was in checkin line (Sky priority is a joke), I noticed staff behind screen varied between 1 and 4. Perhaps Delta is short staffed. When I managed to reach check-in counter, the lady said I cannot check-in luggage as the deadline for baggage checkin is closed. So, either travel next day (which was not feasible for me) or take bag to the gate. Catch is, I had liquids in checkin bag. So, I had to throw them away. Remember, sometimes it is not about stuff but emotions attached to it. I had something special to me in the bag (Hence my resolve to avoid Delta as much as I can). The thing that made me furious is that flight stood at the gate for another 1hour 15 minutes after boarding completed. The most disgusting feeling was the way their staff looked at me when I showed I have DeltaOne. Perhaps, I did not look good enough for their ""Elite"" service.

2022-06-24,1,10,"""by far my worst flying experience""",Loay Osman,✅ Trip Verified |  This is by far my worst flying experience in my life and I’ve been flying since the age of 4 which is 40 years ago and I’ve flown with many international airlines across the globe. This airline is a joke doesn’t even qualify to be a budget LLC. I flew with them 4 sectors all in first class including delta one. First leg was SEA-LAX first class in a very old 30+ years old B737 after boarding and take off and the pilot switch off the seat belt sign I asked the notorious cabin crew if I can use the toilet and I was the very first passenger to use what’s supposed to be the first class cabin toilet and it was filthy and floor full of water and when I informed the FA he said yes it’s flooding. Prior to my departure Delta sent me via their app to choose my meals and since I have specific dietary requirements I choose what’s suitable for me. When the FA was offering the meals he came to me and with a very low and unclear tone he offered me what options they have and when I told him I have a special meal request he said we don’t serve that on domestic flights so eventually I took the oat meal with some shea seeds which turned to be an awful non edible option. After landing and waiting for my luggage I found my suitcase was damaged beyond repair I went to Delta luggage service desk I spoke with the employee who was very unhelpful and not interested to be working she just did a form and gave it to me with a tracking number and till today after almost a month still I didn’t hear from their customer service. My 2nd leg was from LAX-JFK supposed to be with B767-400 the newly refurbished delta one. As per Delta email prior to departure we need to be 2 hrs prior to departure at the airport which is 4am I was there on time and they said there is a dedicated lounge for delta one passengers . There was no one at the check in counters as they said they open by 4 am and to my surprise the Delta one dedicated check in lounge is just a partition of the check in area separated by a partition. We waited till 4:30am one one employee finally showed up and opened the partition and we did our check in finally. The only positive thing was the new delta lounge at LAX . Food options were horrible though. We boarded surprisingly to a very old dirty B767-300 with the old version of Delta one seats. Probably 25+ years old aircraft which was falling apart. Started taxing on time however for almost 1 hr the pilot was taxing around the airport and at 7 am he informed us we are going back to the gate as the plane developed a technical problem which need another hr of repair and we ended up sitting on board for another 2 hrs without even a glass of water or any interaction from the crew we eventually took off at almost 9 am 3 hrs behind our schedule and to my surprise the FA came to me and said you requested for a special meal and it’s ready so they actually serve pre ordered meals on domestic flights. Anyways we landed in JFK almost 3 hrs behind schedule at 5pm instead of 2:15 and I had to rush to catch my 7pm appointment which was so stressful with NYC traffic. The other 2 flights were nothing special LGA-BOS and BOS-DCA we’re both on old dirty EMB175 however we’re very short flights. Conclusion never again on this joke airline.

We were placed on a much later flight that would set us to miss an entire day of already-paid-in-full vacation. We were able to change the flight to an earlier, similar flight. Baggage drop was difficult. We arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early. We also paid an additional $200 to book a hotel next to the airport to ensure this early arrival. This would not have been necessary if not for Delta’s cancellation of our flight. Even with staying at the airport hotel and arriving nearly three hours prior to our flight, baggage check took almost two hours. Despite so many cancellations, Delta staff did not seem to be moving with any sense of urgency for their travelers. Once on our flight, we were set to arrive in Atlanta and connect to a flight to Daytona. When we landed, we discovered that our connecting flight was cancelled midair. We did not receive any notification of this change- no text or call. After speaking to customer service at the ATL airport, we discovered that there was only one other flight to Daytona, our destination. Staff said that it may also be cancelled be we are welcome to select that flight. Ultimately, we were placed on standby for Orlando flights. We were able to barely catch the next flight out. Three Delta staff members assured me my baggage would follow me there. It did not. Since we arrived at the incorrect destination, the rental car company charged us an additional $500 to provide us with a rental car in Orlando. I created a baggage claim with Delta Baggage Claim Customer Service in MCO airport. ^he agent interrupted me often and was very short with me. It was poor customer service that I did not appreciate. She assured me that my luggage would be placed on a flight to either Orlando or Daytona and then delivered to my hotel. Several hours later, my luggage was placed on a flight to Orlando. It has now been at the MCO airport for hours. I cannot reach anyone about delivery. It will be a three hour trip there and back to retrieve my luggage. As for tonight, I have no toiletries or clothes. I cannot even brush my teeth, change my undies, or even swim in a swimsuit because I have no luggage. Delta should be embarrassed and ashamed. As a company, they should not be booking flights that cannot take off due to staff shortages. I am not looking forward to our return flights at all. I am honestly worried these flights will be cancelled as well.

Because of that only half my family traveled while my daughter and I drove from SC to Cali in a rental. Days later I had to talk to three different reps (40 min hold time each) with none being able to get me a straight answer. After asking to talk to a supervisor, he finally confirmed that it was wrong and agreed to refund our follow-on flights.

2022-06-16,4,10,"""Very disappointed with value for money""",M Jennings,"Not Verified |  Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks. The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket. I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch. But for a lot less money, $293 in my case, you can get Comfort Plus with 34 inch pitch and 17.2 inch width. Very disappointed with value for money, I would not waste my time paying for this seat, you may think differently of course.",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 757-200 / 737-900', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'First Class', 'Route': 'Sarasota  to Kansas City via Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'June 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 5, 'Ground Service': 5, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Four months later, Delta then changed our original flight time to 5 hours earlier for no apparent reason - with very long layovers. We immediately called Delta so try to fix this, but were told to wait until 2 months before our trip started to rebook to a later start time, and that changing the start time would require yet another phone call - which we did. After 35 minutes on hold for the 2nd time, the agent couldn't rebook our flight using Delta's internal computer system - for some strange and unknown reason - so were transferred to Delta's ""Manual Servicing"" department. And we were told that changing to a later time - which was very close to our original start time - ""may"" result in incremental charges of over $400 for each of the two flights we were trying to change back to original. 60 more minutes on hold with the ""Manual Servicing"" department - then we were disconnected.

2022-06-15,1,10,"""staff in ATL need training""",T Fayne,"✅ Trip Verified |  The first leg of the flight from DFW to Atlanta was nice. My husband and I landed a few minutes early, however, once we stepped off the plane, everything changed. We endured the worst airport experience ever in our combined 109 years. We had 1 hour to deboard and take the train to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Panama City, FL (ECP). After rushing to get to the other terminal, we were disappointed to see on the screen that our flight to ECP had been canceled. About that same time I received a text from Delta that due to the inconvenience, they would provide us with a complementary hotel room from a list of hotels they provided and a complementary meal. I attempted to reserve a room at one of the hotels provided, only to find that all within 30 miles of the airport were booked. We made our way back to the main terminal and proceeded to stand in a long and winding line at the ticket counter. By this time, it was about 10:30 pm. While waiting in line, I checked the Delta website for the next flights going to ECP. There were no more flights that night, all flights the following day were sold out, and all were sold out two days later except for the late flight that had a few seats remaining. I called Delta Customer Service thinking this may be quicker than waiting in line at the airport, however, the wait time to speak with a CSR was 3+ hours. After waiting in line for over 2 hours and next in line, a Delta staff member walked by the line and asked what we needed. I explained our situation that our connecting flight was canceled, according to website all flights were sold out the next 2 days and none of the complementary hotels had rooms available and was told ""you'll have to wait until next week to get to FL."" About that time, another Delta staff member said they were closing the line down because it was past time for them to go home. We proceeded to the baggage area and waited another hour in line to get our bags and were advised we could not get them that they would be on the 8 am flight to ECP and we could get them whenever we got to ECP, By this time it was 1:30 am. We had to find our own hotel and transportation ($230 + $60 to hotel + $30 from hotel) and planned on renting a car and driving so we didn't lose 2 more days of our vacation. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we returned to the airport and stood in line at Dollar Rental for 2.5 hours before deciding to go back to the airport terminal to see if they had any seat cancellations to ECP or other airports within 2 hours. We waited in line 2 more hours to finally get a Delta staff member who actually was trying to help. She was able to get me on a late afternoon flight and my husband on a flight that evening. I received a $100 credit from Delta for the inconvenience (my husband did not) and $15 voucher for a meal. But, considering we spent $320 on the hotel and transportation to and from hotel, and lost a day of vacation, we are out several hundred. Not to mention I canceled the return flight and rebooked on SW and only received a partial credit. Although I realize there is a shortage in pilots and many flights are being canceled, there needs to be a process set up to ensure those whose flights have been canceled are rescheduled on flights as soon as possible, instead of standing in line after line and not getting anything accomplished. Most importantly, staff in ATL need training on what customer service is, specifically, courtesy and professionalism.",,"{'Aircraft': 'A321', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Dallas Ft Worth to Northwest Florida Beaches via Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'May 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Food & Beverages': 4, 'Inflight Entertainment': 5, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 5, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

They canceled our flight without providing any reasons with a short notice of 5 hours prior to departure. They booked us with an alternative flight for the next day which did not work for us since our work obligation needed us to come back home the same day. I started communicating with an agent online and requested to rebook us with an alternative flight to arrive home the same day. They rebooked us with a different airline. They did not provide any confirmation number or ticket number until I requested them. We went to the SAN airport feeling happy that we successfully rebooked our flight. When we checked the ticket number that Delta provided us online with the new airline we realized that they booked us with a flight with no room! We checked again with Delta at the airport, and without receiving any apology, they tried to book us with another available flight. I asked them now that you booked us with a different airline, how can I ask to reimburse the fees that I paid for baggage check in and seat selection yesterday. They responded that you may request online after the trip is completed. We nearly spent 12 hours at the airport/flight until reaching home for a flight that suppose to take 3 hours. Our baggage was lost and it took us three days to receive it. Then I started processing the reimbursement for the baggage and seat fees with Delta that we have never been provided due to the flight cancelation. I could not pull up the information online and get my e-receipts online using my confirmation number upon arriving home! I had to go to the airport and inquire there. I spent nearly 5 hours at the airport to speak to an advisor which eventually she told me that they are unable to support me since the trip is completed unlike what they promised at the time of departure. They provided me a phone number for care assistance. I called them at least 5 times each time waited on the phone between 2-3 hours to be supported. They asked the ticket number and asked me to stay on the phone for a short while which took forever and they hanged up from their end!

Not worth in Premium R to Europe nothing is different but getting Sky Priority, and headset and the amenity kit. Delta would have to add lounge access to make it worth while.

When we got to Detroit, we were a little early, not much, but we were early. We were not able to get to our gate because something was parked in our way. It was announced that we had to wait for someone to move the vehicle before we could deplane. I was going to ask the stewardess for a seat closer to the front of the plan when I got on, because I only had about 45 minutes to get to my connecting flight to Elmira, NY. I noticed the plane was full so I didn't bother to ask. We waited approximately 10 minutes before the plane could get in its spot for passengers to deplane. According to my ticket I had approximately 45 minutes to get to my new gate for Elmira, NY. Now 10 more minutes had passed, so now I had 35 minutes to get there. Of course I was towards the back of the plan so that was about another 10 to 15 minutes. My daughter had requested a wheelchair assistance for me because I have trouble walking long distances. It was on my ticket for Service request: Wheelchair requested. When I finally got off the plane there was no wheelchair for me. There was another lady there in a wheelchair. I told the lady behind the desk I requested the wheelchair and she said just have a seat that one would be coming. I told her that I had to catch another flight in about 20 minutes and she asked me what time the flight was. I told her and she said "" Oh they are probably gone by now."" I asked her if she could call the gate that I was suppose to go to and she said just have a seat. I was anxious and I said I need to get to my gate. She said to me "" Don't yell at me"". I said I wasn't yelling and that I was concerned about making my flight. About that time a young attendant showed up with a wheelchair but he was assigned to another lady. I said could you please take me to my gate so that I don't miss my flight. He said he was only assigned to the other lady. He saw that I was upset and he said "" OK I will take you too.

Mostly because of Covid I planned my trip by train the rides (round trip) were canceled do to Covid and related personnel issues. So, the price was much higher for this round trip to Florida than anticipated. It was a little tricky to get Delta for every flight. We all hear the news about mask wearing. There are two sides to every story as they say. I have always followed the rules. So, of course I wore my mask with some discomfort. Most people complied with this law for mass transit. I did notice many airline personnel without masks. I am one to mind my own business; but I believe you lead through example. My main problem with flying anymore is the long lines-hurry up and wait. I do have metal implants that can set off security alarm systems at courthouses and airport. I also mention this. So, of course I had to be patted down. i do not like this procedure, but wanting to complete my travel plans i complied. I carry prescriptions that can easily show up on x ray, but most of the pills I carry are holistic supplements. I am sure that my ""misplaced"" luggage was no accident. This has happened to friends in the past and to my husband several years ago( Delta for sure). So, it is my belief airlines are too interested in our personal belongings. Anytime a bag was lost or delayed that said luggage contained medicine, both prescription and holistic. Air travel is very expensive and keeps going up. The inconvenience was just too much during this last trip. In my opinion Delta has higher standards than the other airlines. If i have to travel by air again I know I will choose them. Upon arrival back into Albany in March we took an awful bump upon landing. The flight was from LaGuardia to Albany around five in the afternoon.

After saying this they then proceeded to tell me I cannot board my flight, and could not give me a legitimate reason as to why. The exact words I was told was “oh well you should've got here earlier. She told me she could book me a new flight for the next day and said the price would be $400 when online the same exact flight was $144.

2022-04-06,2,10,"""I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again""",P Johnson,"Not Verified |  Let me just start by saying, riding with Delta this past Sunday was a major inconvenience. On April 3rd I arrived at the airport around 4am to catch my 6.45am flight that would later connect to another flight in ATL. My first flight of that day went smoothly, and I took note as to how the different groups of passengers were being called as to not overcrowd the area. As I had previously flown into CHI using a connecting flight, I had plans to be back in Austin by 12pm so that I could make it to work later that day. When I arrived in ATL, I walked over to station B28 as to be ready to board the plane. I arrived early and I paid close attention as the passengers were called to board the plane, however the screen never changed from saying “PRORITY”. As the announcer called passengers, she announced 1st class, main cabin 1, main cabin 2 and main cabin 3 but to my confusion she never announced BASIC. As time neared for my flight to leave, my roommate and I walked over to the station to ask when they would announce for “BASIC” to board the plane. I watched as a woman and her daughter were helped to board the plane and I stepped up to be boarded right after her. The lady spoke with me and said “I’ll be right back” before closing the door to the plane in front of me and a group containing at least 5 other passengers. The conversation that commenced after her return was very sad when referring to customer service. Not only was she rude to me as a passenger but she seemingly taunted the fact that my flight left without me on board. As she faced me, there was a lady in a red suit to her left who also claimed she wanted to help but offered a 4.40pm flight as a substitute for my 10am flight, omitting the fact that there was a 12.30am flight that she had access to add us to as standby passengers. Both ladies are a poor excuse for employees at a company that is supposed to pride themselves in customer service. Taking the conversation from 0 to 100, I believe it took more effort to be rude then it did to just help us and apologize for the inconvenience. They argued the fact, saying that I was not at the door when I clearly contacted her before she turned her back on me. Not only were the two ladies rude but they seemingly meant harm in their demeanor, and they wanted my flight to leave me behind. As a customer, I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again because if I paid for a flight, I should be able to ride on my flight without complications and poor attitudes from staff. I feel these two ladies were upset with the fact that passengers were slow to accept checking their luggage and they decided to take out their frustrations on the passengers. After getting help at the main Delta help desk, I felt like the employee wanted to be helpful, but the conversation could only be what I feel was “he said she said.” As the lady could do nothing to help me further with submitting a complaint about my previous interaction with the staff at B28 at 10am. The rude behavior from your Delta employees persisted and even as I was placed on standby flight for 12:31am I was still not properly confirmed on my flight. I went to the desk of station B5 and when I asked if he could explain what “standby” meant he rudely told me “Look at the screen” as he continued his conversation with a coworker. Maybe all the employees that work with Delta in ATL specifically are just used to being rude, but that's not fair to customers",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Atlanta to Austin', 'Date Flown': 'April 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

As if that wasn't bad enough, for whatever reason despite my husband and I being ticketed on the same confirmation, we weren't assigned seats next to each other. When he made the reservations, he made sure to request a window seat for me but somehow Delta assigned us to middle seats on the opposite side of the aisle. He spent over 2 hours on hold on Saturday trying to get our seats reassigned so we would be next to each other, only for the customer service agent to tell him that we would need to speak to the agent at the desk to get reassigned. My husband tried to ask, but couldn't even finish asking his question because the agent cut him off and rudely announced over the intercom that there would be no seat reassignments. He asked the flight crew as we boarded, only to be met with blank stares and headshakes. They were unwilling to move other passengers to keep us together. We were now at the mercy of our fellow passengers, none of which were willing to switch seats to keep us together. I’m sure you’re wondering why this is important. I’ve flown frequently, and have noticed that sitting in the middle causes me to have anxiety, motion sickness, and feelings of claustrophobia. And this was all exaggerated by having to wear a mask for a prolonged period of time. My only chance for comfort on this flight, was having my husband by my side, and being switched to a window or aisle seat. I almost immediately had the worst panic attack of my life. Full out crying and shaking. The flight crew walked up and down the aisles past me, not caring that they played a part in my suffering by not moving other passengers to keep me with my husband. And my husband was unable to comfort me, being stuck across the aisle and between two strangers, so this flight was rough on him too. Finally, when one of the flight attendants did ask me what was wrong (while pushing the drink cart up the aisle) I told him, thru my tears, that I needed my husband. He asked me where my husband was, and I told him, but he did nothing to correct my situation. My panic attack lasted the duration of the flight.  I couldn’t get off the plane fast enough.

Now it is down to anywhere from two to five hours. Delta requires human contact for many minor details (such as bringing a dog). But contacting a human at Delta is virtually impossible. And they are generally rude and unhelpful after I spend hours trying to make contact. I have been cut off several times after being connected. The virtual assistants are terrible, too. How can a computer be so stupid? It has been programmed into it. The virtual assistants keep repeating the same information and questions and do not understand what is input by voice or typed.

2022-03-25,1,10,"""my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last""",C Lawrence,"✅ Trip Verified | I am very unhappy. My plane was set to leave at 7.20pm then only 5 hours prior to the flight the plane was delayed and moved to 10.10pm and then they changed it to 8.40pm takeoff and then after boarding 30 minutes later then the boarding time of 8.0pm we are sitting on the plane for over two and a half hours on the runway. They say we’re about to take off and then we are just waiting around for two hours on the plane completely claustrophobic, not COVID friendly whatsoever and all they tell us is that they have to wait to switch directions. After they said they were able to get an alternative route they say the plane doesn’t have enough fuel to do the alternative route and say we have to go back to the gate. Then we are told that the plane isn’t allowed to take off and that we are 'fortunate' to have a gate to come back to because some planes have to just sit and wait on the runway when their is no available gates. My question is, if you originally had the flight at 7.20 departure and then delayed it to 10.10 why would you then undelay it and then only move it to 8.40? Because we’ve been on the plane for more than the second delay time of 10.10. I am extremely disappointed. This was my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last! I have flown on 100+ legs, over 10 different countries and I have never experienced an issue like this before. At least on my other airplane experience they kept us informed. Delta is not transparent and clearly is aware of the situation so why move the delay down just to have everyone sit on the plane for 4 hours past the original departure time? This is the time that I should be arriving at my destination. And the only thing they tell us is “sorry” and then offer our headphones to people and say “these are normally $2 but we’re giving them away because of the delay”. Two dollar headphones treating it like they are doing us a huge favor, they should at the very least give us food. I am blown away and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the company. Then they kick everyone off the plane after sitting in it for hours and tell us the staff needs to go home because they’ve been overworked and can’t go over their hours and that we need to just wait to see what will happen and when they will get new staff and they kept reiterating that the flight was not going to be cancelled only delayed, and then boom after waiting from 5.45pm to 12.45am (7 hours) I find out that our 1.42am (delayed 5 times) is now cancelled. They told me the next flight at 6am is fully booked and then next flight will arrive around at 6pm on Friday. I am missing an entire day in my destination zone and my original flight I had picked specifically based off the time to make sure I would not be missing any work and now I am missing an entire day worth of work and who’s going to reimburse me for that? And also let my job know? I think after waiting 7 hours for a flight where the staff decided to disappear and sitting inside an airport breathing in the air of other people who could potentially have COVID during this pandemic. Completely unacceptable whatsoever. Delta can state that the plane was cancelled due to weather but I don’t agree with that, they are using that as an excuse so that they are no liable for my flight and all the people who had to sit around for 7 hours waiting with full hope for a flight that got cancelled when the crew left.

Heading over to entertainment. It was truly a great variety, featuring all genres of movies and even new releases! But the music had its limitations, even by having a collaboration with Spotify. But it was good nonetheless. Wi-Fi wasn't connecting to my laptop, but it connected to my phone without a problem. Now talking about the food. It was absolutely delicious with its really premium feel to it, with 3 options. We were served lunch and breakfast. Between both meals, we could have snacks at any time if we felt hungry.

My last flight which was an overnight flight from LAX to Fort Lauderdale, which I booked business class. When I booked, I specifically asked if the flight had beds in the 1st/business class and I was told it did. Otherwise, I would never have spent the money I did to fly 1st/business overnight. Not only was there no bed - the seats didn't recline anymore then in the main cabin. I realize this sounds obnoxious to be complaining about 1st/business class seating. The issue is how much we pay for the seat and what it suppose to represent. Not only was there no bed or even an upgraded recliner seat, there were no blankets, no pillows, no service and a little snack in a cardboard box! It's pathetic and all under the disguise of Covid, yet all restaurants are open and serving people. Worst of all - the outbound flight was freezing. The cabin temperature was less then 65 degrees the whole trip. It was miserable! When I asked over and over for the cabin to be a bit warmer I was told how the cabin temp. was not controlled for my comfort, but rather the whole flight. I get it, but everyone was complaining.

2022-02-25,1,10,"""absolutely miserable""",M Andrews,"✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Los Angeles. I typically fly first class for several reasons, the first and foremost reason being that there is extra room. I was flying from MSP to LAX. My husband and I have flown this several years ago and it was absolutely miserable. The seats were so tight that we couldn't even stand up. My husband is 5'10"" and about 165 pounds. He is very physically fit. His knees were against the back of the seat in front of us. The seats were so narrow and tightly squeezed that he started to have a panic attack and got sick. Because of this previous experience on Delta, I decided to get first class, however, the ticket was about $2,500 which was out of the question for this trip. I got their ""comfort plus"" seats. I'm 5'7"" and about a women's size 12- so not huge. Their comfort plus seats are a complete rip-off. They are the exact seats as coach with about 2 inches more of knee room. That's it. I asked the desk attendant about why their comfort seats aren't larger or more spacious and she said ""you're not paying for more room, you're paying for amenities."" Really? So I paid $400 more for a bag of chips and a $1.00 set of ear phones? Yes. Theoretically, the comfort plus is supposed to get on first to get that precious bag space above the seats, but even that backfired, as they allow anyone to go on during their ""comfort plus"" seating and although I sat in row 10, my bag had to be put over seat 16 which made retrieving it after the flight a nightmare. It's clear that Delta does anything possible to give you the very least of everything for the most money they can nickel and dime you for and I will no longer fly with them. I was a loyal frequent flyer with Northwest before it became Delta. Then I was a loyal Delta flyer until they decided to pack people in like sardines and do everything possible to screw us out of more and more money. I will only fly with them if they are the last resort and would even take the ""budget"" airlines over Delta now.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Premium Economy', 'Route': 'Minneapolis to Los Angeles', 'Date Flown': 'February 2022', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 2, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I, for sure, have encountered unpleasant experiences, but that happened to me even with the best rated airline. I think US carriers' weak spot is ground operations, with so many short, small flights that are plagued with delays, cancellations and gate changes (Asian full-service carriers use wide-body aircrafts even on one-hour flights). Now, here is my opinion about this particular flight. Ground service at EWR for Premier class was seamless but not exemplary, and that was certainly below the level of Delta One. In-flight hard product was where this flight shined. The 787-10 was shiny and clean. The Polaris seats were comfortable, spacious, and last but not least, provided a great deal of privacy. This was one of, if not the best equipment for a 5-6 hour flight I ever experienced, even when compare with intra-Asia business class from top rated airlines. On board staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food choices were limited, but I can see improvement on the taste. Food service and presentation was not quite at, though were inching back to, pre-pandemic level. The flight departed on-time and arrived early, but we were still late as we had to wait for our arriving gate, a LAX signature.

He asked to see my Amex card and I showed it to him and he returned it and said all was fine and gave me my boarding passes and claim check. It wasn't until I was onboard my flight from Atlanta to Paris (AF) that I discovered that he'd taken the Amex card and swiped it, charged me $75 anyway, and had hidden the charge receipt behind all of my boarding passes. That is so dishonest and deceptive. I wrote to Delta to complain and two months ago I received an e-mail that just said they were going to notify the concerned departments of this issue.

The second problem arose with the layover timing, which was a ridiculously small time frame to get from the first flight to the second flight, which was accentuated by the fact that the first flight was around 20 minutes late though it claimed to be ""on time.""

In my trip from New Orleans to Boston on January 1st, 2022, I had 4 flights cancelled. My original flight from MSY to ATL to BOS was cancelled, and then I was rebooked from MSY to LGA to BOS, which was also cancelled. I was then put on standby from MSY to JFK to BOS, managed to get on that flight to JFK, and was supposed to have a 6 hour layover - I was able to switch to flight DL675 to BOS so I wouldn't be getting home at 11 PM, and was told by the Delta employee who rebooked me that my flight would be protected--that was then cancelled, and I was told I could not even get on the standby list for the 8:59 PM flight to BOS that I had switched from. I talked to a Delta employee and asked him to cancel the 7:00 AM flight (5762) I was automatically rebooked onto for the next day and request my luggage so I could leave the airport and take an Amtrak home. I waited for 5 hours on the baggage claim floor for my bag (with at least 10 other people doing the same), and was told by the 4th Delta employee I spoke to, 4 hours into waiting, that the 3 Delta employees I had already spoken to who said my flight was cancelled and my bag was requested had actually done nothing. The one competent, nice Delta employee finally requested my bag for me — I then waited another 45 minutes, and then that same employee gave me a file number and took my home address to have my bag delivered to me so I could leave the airport, since it was already 11 PM. By the time I left the airport to go to a hotel so I could catch an Amtrak in the morning, it was too late to cancel my flight, despite the fact that I was told by multiple Delta employees that they cancelled it for me. I had to purchase a hotel room, an Amtrak ticket, and leave without my bag and just hope it actually gets delivered to me.

Three days in a row they cancelled the exact same flights, and had one of the flights delayed by the exact same 4 hours each evening and yet claimed each occurrence of having no crew was random. Gate agents were either clueless or rude, many were unable to perform reticketing that I was able to do through my app. Somewhere around the evening of day two of waiting, they gave everyone meal vouchers, which might have been nice had a single restaurant been open once they decided to give them to us. One agent told me that if you leave security, you can’t come back through (clearly untrue). One agent told me they could not put me on a partnering airlines flight…I confirmed with someone else that they are required to do so if they cannot serve you (they could not, it was going to be more than 24 hours). So I went back up to counter, asked again more finely and they agreed. But, she “had trouble with the system” miraculously until exactly the minute after I could no longer make that flight. They made people wait for 7 hours in the airport for flights where no crew had been scheduled and none would be coming available, three days in a row. On our last delay, we were told “they hoped our crew, arriving from another city, wouldn’t time out before being able to fly.” I’m sorry, you don’t know whether the crew were waiting for is going to be eligible to fly? Seems like someone should have that information, right? I don’t blame the airline for a cancelled flight, or even 8 cancelled flights. I blame them for a combination of stupidity and actual deception that cost many people a lot, and for a complete callous disregard for the feelings of customers.

Being a retired USAF service member, I thought I would be able to serve again by checking my carry on luggage, therefore freeing up an additional space for other passengers. I sat down by the window facing the aircraft and noticed the man that I had taken my checked in carry on luggage open a door to the outside of the walkway to the aircraft. I then saw him bring my bag out first and throw it down this 40 to 45 degree angled ramp. It went about 30 to 45 feet and bounced off of the railing at the bottom. Then he proceeded to throw approximately 13 to 15 more bags down on top of mine. As they slid down they literally bounced off of my small carry on luggage until the pressure was too much and they just simply stop bouncing and continued to press against my small luggage. When I arrived home, after my flight to Raleigh, NC and begin to unzip my bag, I immediately noticed that it had been significantly damage.

The day before I left, I tried to check in for my connecting flight and it wouldn't let me. I had to sit on hold for about an hour (while at work mind you) trying to figure out what was wrong. I was very concerned as I knew no one in the state I'd be connecting flights with, and I'd have no way to get home for a while without getting on a new flight. The lady I spoke with said everything would be fine, I'd get my seat assigned at the gate. So the next day, I take my first flight, and go to connect to my second. I get to the gate and ask the lady behind the desk for my seat. She told me ""you're going to have to wait, we oversold this flight and I have to make sure you still have a seat"".

I stood there waiting for about 45 minutes trying to find my bag. It never came up, so I went to the baggage office, where they initially tried to brush me off and said ""you just didn't wait long enough, you need to go back and look more"". This made me extremely irritated, as it was obvious they just wanted to get me out of their way, and they didn't really care that my bag was missing. Even when I explained that I had important medications in there, their attitudes did not change. Eventually, a very nice agent named Arthur helped me get a ""lost or mishandled claim"" filed, and he was probably the only helpful Delta associate I dealt with this trip.

The Flight Attendants were all extremely courteous and welcoming. We had two layovers and it was as comfortable as it could be sitting on a plane for 6 hour increments. We did hit a snag from Georgia to South Bend. Our layover was already 3h30m and the plane was delayed and hour but the gate agent decided not to inform any of us. So everyone sitting at the gate was just staring at each other wondering if there was a change. Luckily for us it was the last leg of the trip so we had time to spare. If others were connecting to other departures, it definitely would have been an issue. We did sit in Comfort plus which I believe was worth it for the long journey. They don't over meals but they do come around often with snacks and various beverages. They also had a pretty great app that's extremely user friendly and tracks your luggage if you decide to check in. I would consider strictly flying with Delta but may have to find another Carrier going to SBN. It seems their only route is through Georgia, and not only is the gate completely on the other side of the airport ( a good 40min walk) I was completely turned off by the lack of communication from their Gate Employee.",yes,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Premium Economy', 'Route': 'Honolulu to South bend', 'Date Flown': 'November 2021', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Food & Beverages': 4, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 5, 'Value For Money': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Lounges were closed due to covid but also by the time I had made it past security it was already almost time to board the plane. What made this flight memorable was the attention provided by the lead flight attendant which went out of her way to make me feel welcome. Unlike my previous flight also on Delta one as soon as upon entering she walked me to my seat and asked me is she could stow my jacket. A duvet, pillow, Tumi amenity kit, noise canceling phones and big water bottle were waiting on my seat. While taxing dinner orders were taken as well as drink choices and throughout the short 5 hour hop back to New York City many rounds of wine were provided. The meal was a veggie sandwich with hummus, some custard which was amazing, salad and wine. Later on I found out the same was offered on coach so this is where the airline lagged but to their defense meat wasn’t allowed on flights by Colombian authorities due to the pandemic.

So we walked over to the other gate as instructed just to find out that our flight was delayed until 6:00pm. We had already been at the airport all morning so I was little irritated by then. However when it was time to board at 6:00pm, the plane sat there for 40 mins with no take off. I could hear the flight attendants say they have been working for more than 15 hours that day, so everyone was taken off the plane and by then we had missed out connecting flight home from Atlanta to Omaha. We had to wait until 12:30 AM for Staff from another plane to take everyone at that time from Orlando to Atlanta. I couldn't believe how long I was forced to sit at the airport just for a 1 hour flight. They didn't offer food or drinks to any of the passengers who missed dinner and were staving. Needless to say, we didn't arrive to Atlanta until 2:30 Am. But then we still had to catch a flight to Omaha. Delta made us walk from the airport to a hotel at 2:30 AM to Sleep for 3 hours and then we had to walk back to the airport so catch a flight at 8:00Am to Omaha.

When these two elderly gentlemen arrived at the airport there was nobody to man the desk at Delta. A member of the security staff directed them to another terminal where he had seen some attendants, but after a long trek with kitty in tow they returned to the Delta desk, having found nobody to help. A Delta employee then showed up and asked them if she could help. The plane was already boarded, and she held it so my friend could get his boarding pass, pay for the transport of the cat, and go home. She then rousted some employees from what must have been a break room and handed my friend off to two of them. These two employees were apparently unable to work the Delta computer system, and after a number of attempts the flight left, stranding my friend and cat in Spokane for the night with all the costs that entails. When my friend voiced just how upset he was, without threatening anybody, he was threatened with removal by security. He did eventually get his flight changed to the next day, and was able to make his way home. What a terrible way to treat an elderly gentleman who has just had a very painful loss!

2021-10-07,1,10,"""Delta has not provided any assistance""",D Miller,"✅ Trip Verified | I purchased tickets through Alitalia for the Alitalia/Delta partnership with economy ticket seats for travel between Boston and New York JFK and premium ticket seats for the transatlantic flights between New York and Rome Italy. The transatlantic flights were to be on Alitalia, however on September 1 with a hurricane approaching the northeast coast forced a closure of JFK NY airport. As a result Delta offered an alternative flight from Boston to Amsterdam and then to my final destination, Rome. This avoided New York and the hurricane altogether. I thought my departure and arrival problems were resolved until: 1) Although I paid for a premium transatlantic seat, I was given an economy seat. I specifically asked the attendant at the boarding gate to confirm that I had a premium seat. He said I did which was not true and I discovered this after I boarded the plane. Therefore, I can only conclude that the individual at the desk either outright lied or was completely incompetent. Either way he did not care one bit about the customer. 2) Delta delayed my luggage. I arrived in Rome on Thursday. I did not receive my luggage until the following Monday. 3) I tried to get a partial reimbursement from Delta for the cost difference between the economy seat and the premium seat. They have told me that although they were the ones who made the mistake, they could not provide a partial refund and that I would need to go through Alitalia. To date Delta has not provided any assistance in obtaining my partial refund. In fact they have only wasted my time with numerous phone calls with very lengthy waiting time on the phone. Lastly, it took them more then a week to get back to me and tell me that Delta could not help and that I must go through Alitalia. The representative on the phone chose to argue with me rather than help. I was neither rude nor aggressive on the phone since I know that would not have helped. I am still waiting to hear back from Delta or Alitalia. No refund yet. At present I will choose not to fly Delta and that will hold true for Alitalia since they are going out of business in the near future.

Have been Delta Platinum card members for years! We used to not care if another airline was a little more expensive because we are loyal Frequent Flyers. We are learning this means little to nothing to Delta. We had a flight to Cabo San Lucas non stop, round trip in Delta comfort that was cancelled by the airline and replaced with a very inconvenient and lengthy route and main cabin seats. The flights we had scheduled to fly originally had not been cancelled they simply moved us and down graded cabin to the other flights! We were to fly home from Cabo to Salt Lake City for a five hour layover and leaving at midnight to Atlanta arriving at 5am. This is wrong. So they refunded us for the difference in airfare after we called them on it and returned us to our original return flight. Months ago I made round trip Delta Comfort (first class was full) flights to Rome ahead of our cruise in Europe next May. Today we noticed that the reservations are no more in our “My Trips”.

Delta was a different feel the flight attendants didn't really seem to want to be there, they offered drinks 1 time on a 5 hour flight and the seating was very uncomfortable. Our knees were almost touching the seats in front of us. There were TVs on each rest for our long flight from Hawaii but not from Washington to San Jose.

Flight crews were okay. I can't really complain or rave. Pro Tip: The first row of Delta's Comfort Plus on their domestic Airbus and Embraer E-175 aircraft have more legroom that their domestic first class seats. IFE was okay, I forgot to bring my headphones but that's okay. I did not use their Wi-Fi.

The gift cards would be applied to the departure flights. So she cancelled our flight but couldn't get the refund to process. I was transferred to a different representative where I sat on hold for an additional 5 hours! That representative told me that he couldn't process a refund he'd have to keep our departure flights and refund our gift cards - applying them to our departure flight wasn't an option unless they cancelled both flights and then rebooked the departure flight. I asked how long it would take and he assured me that it would be within 7 days. We are long past 7 days ... we have no refund, no departure flight and flights have now more than doubled in cost! We called Delta today who told us that it could actually take us up to 30 days to see our refund - which is after our trip, and that they would not honor the original ticket pricing and that we'd now have to pay more than double for our departure flight.

I asked where special services was and she said “that large group of people of there”. I explained that this whole area is one large group of people, can you be more specific. Her response was “figure it out”. If that was deplorable enough, I then sat in the special services line for 40 minutes. Missing my flight. I was Confused as to why this line was also taking forever. To my shock, When I was at the top of the time to get the next special service agent the agent called not 1 but 2 regular bag drop passengers before he called me. I saw another special service agent do the same. At this point I’m furious and holding back tears when the agent says - sorry you missed your first flight and the next 3 are booked.

Me and my family flew from Elmira NY to Orlando Fl. Before we even left for our trip they changed our flights 5 times. As well as changing the layovers. Our trip finally got here we made it to Florida. It cost me $90 for checked baggage. The flight down wasn't too bad. They didn't offer anything special in flight. We did notice they messed up someone else's tickets and seats as well. Assigning the same seats to more than one person. When it was time for us to fly home from Florida we got to the airport and they told us it was too late for them to check our baggage and that we would have to be put on standby. Noting that there were 3 of us and only one flight going out at 4 pm and the connecting flight in Detroit only had one flight that day as well. Again leaving us on stand by for 3 people stranded without a connecting flight. And our original flight was to leave at 8.20 am from Orlando. So basically leaving us stranded in Orlando with no flight. The lady at the counter was rude, acted like she could not care less, and did not explain the process at all to us. She hurried us through and pushed us away. Leaving us with more questions than answers. We had to ask someone else, then stand in the long line again to get another agent to explain the whole standby process to us. To tell us that our chances of all three of us getting a seat on the next flight was very slim to none. We could not wait another day or two in a Florida airport nor Detroit to get a flight home when I had a 14 yr old son with me as well as having to be at work and having to get home to our animals. So we ended up having to spend more money to rent a car to drive home from Orlando Florida to New York so we were not stuck in an airport for days waiting for Delta to get us a flight.

I’ve been on hold for an hour and 20 minutes when they said “our estimated wait time is 13 minutes” That’s 6X wrong and also made it so I couldn’t bring something I needed to with me because I wasn’t sure if it was allowed or not.

I sure hope they make me wait a few more hours to figure that out.

When flying with this airline a certain level of quality is expected and I am disappointed. It started out with the flight being delayed until they had access to a full crew and departure time was pushed by twice for that purpose. Then the pilot comes out to say due to regulations he could only work a certain number of hours and would not be able to fly the aircraft and we would have to wait for another pilot. Results were that the flight got pushed to the next morning . During the night the departure gate changed 3 times. Once they arrived in the morning they were a pilot short and pushed departure time once again. For those that opted to stay in the airport and wait, the overnight crew was nonchalant and blaise about the whole ordeal. In addition they were ill prepared with pillows blankets and snack boxs and were acting as if they were bothered by even extending that hospitality.

2021-07-28,1,10,"""extremely disappointed with Delta and the crew""",D Nash,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight (DL386) LAX-BNA on July 25th started off not well. I was traveling with my family (Myself, wife, son & Daughter). My wife was flying first class with my daughter and I was flying comfort plus with my son. Somehow leading up to the flight our seats were changed without any notice. We are traveling with small children and by law they can not sit by themselves. We found out about the seat changes trying to check in 24hrs in advance. We could not fix our seats together and were told (after holding for 6 hours on the phone) to wait until we reached the gate. We arrived at the airport and there was only one gate attendant with a long line of customers. She was not attending to any of them. Finally someone in line spoke up and she was flustered. She dismissed half of the people in line to go sit down. They were told to deal with their issue at the scanning of boarding passes. We were still seat separated from our children. I finally spoke up and she addressed the situation to get us seated together. Our flight departed a bit late and upon approach into BNA our captain notified us that there was heavy weather and we may have to divert to Memphis. He circled three times and aborted the landing at BNA. We landed in Memphis (1/2 hour from BNA) and are notified that we need to refuel before we can go back and to land at BNA as the storm has now cleared. We now hear from the Captain on the PA that he and his cockpit crew have ""timed out"". We are asked to deplane and wait for alternative cockpit crew. Our flight was initially supposed to land at BNA at 5:11pm, It's now 5:55 as we begin to deplane at Memphis. We find ourselves now at an airport with no restaurants open. Our children are starving. I spend $80 buying junk and jerky at the airport store to tide them over. We now hear from the gate that our incoming pilots will not arrive until 8:30pm (which actually turned into 9:45 because of the incoming delayed flight from Atlanta). We contemplate driving ourselves back to BNA, but that would be a 3 hour drive with the kids. We are now held captive in an airport with no food, an extremely long day of travel and no help from Delta staff or crew. They tell us the only thing available at this airport right now is the drinking fountain and then laugh about it. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of planning and customer service coverage the Delta staff. I understand the timing out of pilots, however the situation after the diverted flight should have been handled better. We were not the only parents with upset, hungry and tired children so my feelings here are mutual as all passengers on flight DL386 where unhappy about the lack of customer service and planning. There was nothing offered to snack on let alone to drink. Even as we re-boarded with the new pilot crew. The staff on flight DL386 didn't offer any snacks that we could see from our seats in first class. Yet when the pilots came on board they handed them both large Bistro Snack Boxes. I'm extremely disappointed with Delta and the crew. This situation could have been handled so much better. We finally got to BNA by 10:30pm( 5 hours after our initial arrival time to BNA) It's now 11:30pm by the time we get the kids home. They're now eating at 11:45pm. NOT a great situation or Delta experience to say the LEAST!!We have a choice when we travel.

I was sitting on an aisle seat when two young men who I could tell from their attire are of a strict religious group, asked the young man across the aisle, without addressing me, if he and I could switch seats. Due to religious reasons, they wanted to have a man sit there. We both said no, because the man across the aisle was sitting with his wife and son. I suggest airlines screen their passengers better for religious preferences. Furthermore, these two young men took their masks off most of the flight. I told one of the flight attendants, and she told them to put them on, which they did until she left. A passenger behind us also told them to put them on to no avail. Flight attendants walked up and down the aisle and never told them to put their masks on. Personally, I wore two masks which I didn't take off the entire flight even to drink water.

I’ve flown many different airlines before, but I’ve never had so many problems like I have with Delta. This was my first and LAST time flying Delta. I had originally booked a roundtrip, direct flight from ONT to ATL months in advance. Then, a few weeks before, the scheduled flight Delta kept changing my return home flight time (3 times). Eventually they had changed it from a departure time of 5pm to 8am, which is a huge difference in time change. Not only did they change the time, but they changed the return airport from ONT to LAX! I was not ok with either of these drastic changes to the flight I originally booked. I called a Delta representative and told him what had happened. He told me he could make the changes and reschedule me to a direct 4:30pm flight. I assumed things were fixed. It wasn’t until the day before my return flight, when I was supposed to check in, did I realize that he still had my flight booked for the wrong airport (LAX). I then had to spent over 3 hrs on hold waiting to speak to a Delta customer service representative, and over a half hour talking to someone to get my flight fixed. She told me all the direct flights to ONT were sold out, and I would have to take a connecting flight which would be later in the evening arriving to ONT at 11:30pm. I asked if I could wait for standby on a direct flight at 5:50pm. She said she would put me on the list for standby. I was waiting early for standby at the airport until all passengers had finished boarding, as I was directed by the gate Delta attendant. They even said there was one seat that I could take, but when they tried adding me to the seat, they said there was a problem. The system couldn’t give me a direct flight because I only paid for a connecting flight. When I showed them that I did pay for a direct flight they said the representative who booked me this morning did it wrong then. And there was nothing they could do for me.

They need 5 flight attendants to fly. They only had 4 currently because  the 5th person is stuck in traffic. When the 5th flight attendant showed up ... all 5 of them had lunch at another gate so they won't be seen. Unbelievable know they caused the delay.

2021-07-09,1,10,"""I was astonished by this type of treatment""",Paige Antonio ,"✅ Trip Verified | Recently this Thursday, I had the worst experience I have ever encountered on a flight. My family and I had important plans to fly into New York, LGA. However, during our flight, about a half an hour away from LGA the captain of the plane informed us we will be having a delay and they will be stopping the plane in Atlanta. We were upset but understood this is due to weather conditions, and they let us know it would probably be a 1-2 hour delay and to stay close to the terminal when we get off the airplane. When we got off, we were then informed that our flight was actually going to be delayed until 8am in the morning! Shocked, we proceeded to find a help desk to see what we were going to do. As we were walking, we noticed another flight that was boarding for the same place we were supposed to go to, LGA! We were so confused on how they were able to go but we were not? We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the same tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves! We were also told the flight would be departing at 8am, so we had to wake up early in the morning and catch the 5.30am shuttle to Atlanta Airport. This is really when the true nightmare began, as we asked an employee where we should go with our tickets, and she told us since we already had the tickets from our delayed flight we could hop in line for the regular security route. So, after waiting 15-20 minutes in line we went up to the employee who scans the boarding passes and was told “We cannot take these passes you need new ones, leave out that exit door” and we were rudely told to leave as the employee got frustrated with us as we were trying to explain our situation. We then got in line for Special Services, which the security employee directed us too by pointing. It was 5.30am and there was no employees there to even help us yet because they were in a briefing, so we were told by another employee they won’t be available until 6am! Astonished, we got in another line for Special Services and waited about 25 more minutes. We were then greeted by a man all the way at the right side corner, and we attempted to explain our situation with him. He got very rude with us and told us our flight was now taking off at 6.30am and that he would not give us new boarding passes and insisted that we could use the same ones we had even after getting kicked out of security! My father tried to explain further to him, and he replied “Would you rather just sit here and argue with me and miss you flight?” I was astonished by this type of treatment, I truly felt like I was highly disrespected after spending over 1000 dollars this month on flights with Delta! He refused to even look at our boarding passes. We then headed over back by security and began trying to explain our situation to another lady who told us we needed new boarding tickets as well. However, another worker heard us in distress and walked over to us. She was a customer relations worker, I had forgotten to get her name however she was the nicest most helpful woman.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Sarasota to New York', 'Date Flown': 'July 2021', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

It is blatantly an act of being cheap on the part of the airline. The service was awful. The young gentleman that served us was probably the least friendly flight attendant I have ever encountered especially given he is serving first class passengers which makes it worse.

We then checked on the flights of my children and learned that their flights had also been cancelled with no notice. Wow ... not even an e-mail with an update. I called numerous tome with lengthy waits. One morning, I waited 2 hours and 10 minutes, but got through to customer service. I cancelled our flights and the woman on the line asked us to hold while she went to check on the refund. She came back and, before providing us an answer, asked us to call back! Really! Well, I did call back and was put into a queue that stated that I would receive a call in the next 2 hours. Six hours later, I did receive that call. The gentlemen was quite helpful. The tickets had been cancelled and fully refunded...thought no confirmation e-mail evert sent. This little mishap of an experience is now over. I would like to point out, though, that we had this exact same experience last summer with similar flights between Washington Dulles and Rome Fiumincino. These flights were Alitalia flights in both instances. After reading this review, should you still choose to book with Delta, I would strongly recommend you check your flight status on occasion prior to your trip so you do not find yourself standing at the airport on the day you think your are flying only to find your flight has been cancelled. I will no have to concern myself with this as I will never again fly Delta Airlines. The only thing I will do is continue to share my story with any who ask about my experience with Delta.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Washington to Rome', 'Date Flown': 'June 2021', 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

From the start of this trip it’s been a nightmare getting help. First our flight was delayed out of Portland for over 3 hrs which made us miss our International flight/connection in Minneapolis. We ended up losing a day and a half of our trip to Iceland. Then while in Iceland My mother was in a really bad accident and was in the ICU. I need to speak with someone to change my flight to come home early. I had to wait for over 3 hrs on the phone to get help. My husband stayed in Iceland to finish out the trip. My mother has taken a decline and now won’t pull through so my husband is trying to get home to be here before she passes and can not get through to anyone to help. It’s a 9 hour hold.

Arrived 1.5 hrs ahead of my flight and paid the fee to ensure I would not lose my flight or be bumped. Followed all standard protocols and abided by all rules. Remind you my flight was booked to leave early A.M. so arrival in Chicago would leave me enough time to get a full day's work in and return to Florida mid-day. Arrived at Fll at 4am. Our flight was at 5:30 am. with a connection in Atlanta. Plane broke on the runway. Then the plane needed fuel, then the plane broke again. Anyways my flight was changed 2 times before we arrived in Atlanta and when we arrived at 8:54 our connection had just left at 9am. Missed that one too. Then they put me on the 11am flight. Last 2 seats but we made it. Arrived in Chicago 4 hours late. And then had to set there until 4pm because they forgot our tools for the job in Atlanta. We missed the appointment to work on the vessel and all reservations were missed. Our return flight was at 10am by luck we had a chance to have a conversation with the yacht owner who was very disappointed and asked if we could at least come come and look at the vessel since we had made the trip up there. The only thing Delta did correct was we schedule our flight for 6:30pm Saturday. Which gave us the time to see the customer. When we made it to boarding and was filing on to the aircraft the flight attendant had an issue with another passenger that we weren't even with who was drinking or drunk not sure as I was not with him. But she advised us to get off the plane. Then she proceeded to tell the captain and redcoat she felt endangered.  To end the story that left me sleeping on the floor until at the airport until this morning at 7:30am. I'm writing my review on the plane waiting to take off and I'm livid!

2021-06-23,3,10,"""attendants were not happy with their jobs""",John Kaba,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were a party of 4 flying from Denver, CO to Maui, HI. We had booked this trip almost 6 months prior, and I had a choice of seats, and picked out the ones I wanted. However this flight was switched a few months back, and although they specified to check the schedule change, which I did, and there was just a few minutes difference in time. I did not think that I would have to check my seats, as I assumed they would transfer with the flight. They did not! I found this out the day before our flight, and I scrambled to find adjoining seating for the 4 of us, and was successful in locating seating for us, it was in the middle and not window seats like I had originally chosen. I called Delta hoping that I would be able to speak with an agent and get things changed. I was told by a recorded message that the wait time could be up to 3 hrs! which is ridiculous, however, I was determined to speak to someone to get changes made to our seating arrangement. 1 hr went by, and then 2! Still no answer. After waiting until 3 hrs and 3 minutes, I decided i had had enough, and took a screen shot to prove to Delta that I had tried to make changes to my seating arrangements to no avail!. On to Baggage Check. Check-In went reasonably well, and the Baggage Check-In Process went fairly quickly. This was the first time we had flown Delta in a long time. We usually travel using Southwest, and are used to their Baggage Check-In and Boarding Process. Needless to say, I was surprised at the baggage fees we were charged. On Southwest your baggage is free! Not the case with Delta. It cost $30 for the 1st checked bag and $40 for a second. For the 4 of us we had 6 bags, and it cost me $200! I should have done more checking on this prior to purchasing tickets. The only reason for flying Delta in the first place was that they fly larger jets to Hawaii than Southwest, and so we thought we'd be more comfortable, which we later found out not to be the case. Next came the boarding process, and after waiting for everyone else to board, finally it was our turn to go and find our seats that I was forced to endure. Our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City was delayed due to an air conditioning issue? In any case it caused enough of a delay that when we landed in Salt Lake City, we were told that they were doing a final boarding call for our flight to Maui. We ran with our carry on luggage down the concourse for about a quarter mile or so, and they were just closing the door on the jetway and informed us that we had just barely made it. We told them that there were a couple of others from our flight also on their way, but they did not seem concerned, and closed the jetway door behind us. Flight to Hawaii was pretty uneventful, but while our beverage requests were taken care of, it was evident that the flight attendants were not happy with their jobs. It seemed like everything that we asked of them was a burden. The snacks are another thing. No variety at all. We were offered the same snacks over and over on each of the 4 legs of our trip. Almonds and Biscoff cookies.  We will be flying Southwest next time. About the only annoying thing about that airline is that you need to be prompt in your check-in 24 hrs in advance in order to get an A or B pass.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Denver to Maui via Salt Lake City', 'Date Flown': 'June 2021', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 4, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We had a flight booked with Delta from ATL airport on Father’s Day leaving at 12:15 PM going to JFK Airport . We arrived at the airport three hours early as we try to prepare flying with small children. First we were never told that while traveling with an infant on lap we will be required to formally check in and will not be able to use the kiosk. The lines of formally check in took us about an hour and a half with two young children in a double stroller. We kept telling them was there another way for us to check in or asking for help as both children were not able to tolerate the wait. We were told we had to wait in that line however they were pulling off people with pets to make sure they were checked in on time for their flight. An hour and a half later we finally reached the check-in, we checked in went through security and arrived at the gate at 12:03 PM where there was a whole debacle of people Up in arms as they were flying standby. I tried to make my way up to the counter to explain we had tickets and we’re on this plane. The girl told me we were too late and our tickets were given away and to go to see customer service. There I am traveling with a one-year-old and a three-year-old and our bags trying to get on my flight that they gave our tickets away as we were not there 15 minutes early. However the plane was still there still boarding but they gave our tickets away. We headed to customer service for Delta by the time we got a supervisor involved the plane had already left. Once the supervisor realized this was a mistake made and we should’ve been able to board our scheduled flight he put us on the next flight which was hours later. Now sitting in an airport for 5 to 6 hours with two babies was a horrible experience. But this is not the worst of it we finally land at JFK airport about 6:45 PM with our two children to find our luggage was not there. Delta at JFK told us he never left Atlanta and he said it up to be shipped to our residence home for the following day. The following day came and our luggage with never sent I called five different times and heard five different stories first I heard it was in Atlanta then I heard it was in JFK then I heard it came in on the first flight that we were scheduled to be on it don’t know what happened to it then I heard that it came in on the second flight that we were on they don’t know what happened to it and then I was hung up on. Finally being fed up I demanded a callback from a supervisor as in this luggage was medical equipment for my infant daughter. My daughter was born with bilateral hip dislocation and was it a body cast the first half of her life no she currently uses a hip brace to prevent her hips from falling out of place. She is supposed to wear this every night at bedtime this brace cost a few thousand dollars. After being so rudely treated and lied to I had to let the Delta representative know that any harm done to my child’s progress with her hips Delta would be accountable for and I will make sure of it then all the sudden a supervisor called me back.

The Delta representative informed me that error should have been corrected before I flew, even though I told them I tried fixing this error in the airport. Sorry Delta, your customer service quality is poor, especially when the flight is not cheap.

We’d flown to Key West in FLA in October 2020 First Class and Tampa in January Comfort Plus, and loved both trips. What we didn’t realize is that the planes we’d be flying on this time around were smaller. 2 seats on one side, 1 on the other. There was no separation, which eliminated the “exclusive” feel we’d enjoyed with our first trip. Additionally, there were no TV screens. On the December flight, we were able to watch entire feature films. Additionally, each of the four legs of the trip were different in terms of food or drink service. Leg 1 - PWM to LGA we were offered snack boxes in addition to water, drinks, etc. On the shorter LGA to EYW, we were not offered the boxes. On the return trip, no snack boxes were even offered. Added to the substantially downgraded “first class” experience due to the smaller aircraft, this all contributes to an overall sloppy and inconsistent feel, that is to say, “You never know what you’re going to get until you get on board”. On the leg back, we were looking forward to a couple of the new margaritas in the can. They were amazing, having discovered them on the way down. But, they only packed 2 cans for the whole trip for the plane, the attendant says this happens a lot. We’ve had similar experiences where we weren’t able to get water because you’d run out of the little 8 oz bottles. That’s just unacceptable. (As a side note, an 8 oz bottle of water on a 2-3 hour flight offers little in the way of meaningful hydration. I generally ask for two for each of us. Perhaps a more practical size would be more appropriate?) At the Key West airport on the leg back to LGA, we were the last ones to board. Why? Because the young attendant did not call first class. When we asked about it, she said, “well I called Diamond, that’s the same thing.” Well, no, it’s not. This same attendant was very unhelpful when we asked her about boarding passes. On our last trip to KW we had to print boarding passes vs. using our mobile ones. She said she didn’t really know, they prefer printed but that we should be able to use the mobile, well, can we use them or not? Finally, I’m hard of hearing. I understand that there’s not a lot that can be done because of the mask wearing mandates, but you’ve really got to teach your employees how to make clear announcements. How to annunciate properly, speak reasonably slowly and loudly enough. I’ve never felt so discriminated in my life, having to ask people around me if you’d said anything important. (Most of them didn’t hear the announcements either). On the first leg from PWM to LGA there was one young lady who was wonderful. Every other attendant gave us the impression that we were a bother. So all in all, we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it on several fronts. We found little similarity between our December & January first class trips and this one. We’re seriously disappointed, and will be sure to ascertain what type of plane we’ll be flying on and get clear on boarding and offerings. Additionally, as a direct result of our disappointment, we plan to book our next first class trip with either AA or United.

This situation is not the first time its happened but the communication has never improved, we were notified at 3pm that our 6.40 flight was delayed till 8.30, but being 1.5 hours from the airport we were in the cab, so we went back to the hotel. 30 minutes later we received a text that our flight was on time, so now we are cutting close to get back to the airport. 5 hour hold time to call someone. At the airport we were told flight is delayed till 10 but we needed to be there at the original time to get thru customs, ok but how about putting that in the text. When they finally cancelled the flight they told us the original flight would leave at 10.15 but stop in Atlanta.

But I asked, and the lady came back, handed me the bottle, and asked for a credit card. I was taken aback, and had to reach down under the seat where my purse was, and the stupid cart was in the way so I bumped my head, the lady was very rude and uncaring, and it was just a terrible experience because the attendants were so nice on my flight down here but they were just so rude on my flight back home.

The attendant spoke to me about my 5 year olds mask, and we fixed it. Shortly later I received a “final warning” and was told a red coat would remove me from the flight. They also made this announcement to the entire flight threatening to be removed like criminals. A group of 6 young men were sitting behind us, and before even leaving the gate the male attendant told them they would be removed if they gave him any problems. They were doing nothing wrong. Those boys also told the “red coat” that the attendant never spoke to me aside from the one time about my 5 year old. The attitudes over masks slipping down is ridiculous. Even if I were spoken to, they acted like I threw a fit and refused to wear a mask completely when I in fact had the mask on the entire time. The attendant also rammed the snack cart into a woman’s leg/arm rest several times to push past. I have flown Jetblue since Covid and had no problems, I had no problems going from Boston to Florida on Delta. This crew was just awful. The “red coat” they made out to be an evil person ready to throw me in prison, was very nice and understanding even when the attendant butted into our conversation after the boys behind me said I wasn’t spoken to.

Booked in March 2021 from Edinburgh to New York on a direct flight at 10.30am, taking about 7 hours. I live 20 minutes from the airport and I chose Delta because it was a direct flight. These are difficult to get from Scotland as BA does not route a single flight from Scotland to the USA. You have to go via Heathrow. First May email comes saying not only am I now leaving at 6.00am in the morning instead of 10.30 but from Edinburgh to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to New York - 15.5 hours. Delta fly daily from Edinburgh to JFK and while I understand they might have cancelled some of them due to Covid I did not expect them to cancel every, single flight. Every, single, day. I was quite surprised because when I tried to book by seats quite few were already taken. So many people have been inconvenienced. I had booked on the premise that if Scotland was shafted yet again as the easy option, they would fly me from another airport, one within the UK. They fly from Heathrow on both Delta operated flights and code share with Virgin too. But they routed me backwards via Amsterdam. Nine hours after I left the house for my 20 minute trip to the airport, I would be back over UK airspace again, right back to where I started.  They would not put me any of the Heathrow flights because they would have to pay BA to fly me there from Edinburgh and they do not code share with them.  They would not give me my money back because I am not American. US law means they have to refund American citizens if they cancel flights with no comparable alternative but as they advised me, they can pretty much do what they want with others. No legal requirement to compensate me or route me even from the same country. I could rebook but they would keep my money until I did. For a year. Then they would keep it all.  So, I had to cancel and rebook from Heathrow and pay the cost of getting myself a return flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Apart from the totally inconvenient flight times and flight changes from direct to indirect flights and 2 set sets of immigration to queue up for, I had no wish to have to check if 2 countries still had their borders open to UK citizens until 22nd June. If you live in the EU then Book with European airline in these uncertain times. EU law would have ensured that not only would a full refund be forthcoming, but 600 euro would have to be paid in compensation. UK has kept this part of EU law.

I had never used Delta before but it was the only airline that didn't have a 6am return flight. I was traveling with my boyfriend and 3 yr old son. First, I booked the flight and car. All the funds were pending. When it actually charged my card, I noticed it was 1 plane ticket less. I thought maybe they changed something due to my son's age, cool. So I questioned whether he would be allowed a carryon or not. The website says its based on price. Seeing as to how I wasn't sure what happened with the ticket prices, I figured I'd call to find out. I spent 9 HOURS to ask this simple question. 5 hours on hold waiting for someone to answer before I gave up, and 4 hours trying to use the online chat. Finally, I got someone, gave them the ticket number (which I figured they would say something if they missed the charge), they said yes to the carry on. Then we get to the airport. We're carrying our bags, a carseat, a stroller and a child. We were rushed through everything as if we were an inconvenience (ok whatever). We get to the gate and wait. Then our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue with the a/c. For 2+ hours. We missed our connecting flight in Atlanta. At this point I'm stressed, but think ""better safe than sorry, things happen"". Flight back: again, rushed through security. Get to the gate. Wait. Another delay. Mechanical issue with the a/c unit. What are the chances? Again, waiting hours to get on the plane and missing our connecting flight home. Here's the kicker, it was the last flight from Minneapolis to Milwaukee that day so we were not getting home. They searched for options and said we can maybe get you on tomorrow but all of tomorrow's flights are booked up so we'll put you on standby and hopefully you get something. They put us in a hotel in Minneapolis for the night. I had thrown away a bunch of stuff that I didn't think we needed anymore; toothbrushes, toothpaste, trial sizes of deodorant, all of the toiletries. So we had none of that. Ok now we go to the airport again to see if we can get on a plane. They luckily said yes, gave us tickets. We wait. They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself. Finally, an attendant on the plane helped me switch seats with another rider so my toddler didn't have to sit with a stranger. We got home and I was just relieved to have it all over with.

They called me up and said that the connecting flight was in jeopardy but that they might make up time in the air and I might be ok, but they offered me a alternative to go to Detroit and then to Cleveland on a later flight, said they would put me on it and I could decide before the boarding of the one that might be late into NY. I said ok, fine. 2 minutes later they said they couldn't get me that because someone took the seat they had for me and it was the last one. OK, I figure well, at least I get to New York and surely Delta will get me to Cleveland, both being large cities. So the original flight delays more and more and they they find me again and say...we know you have been here for a very long time Sir, but we can't get you to Cleveland today""? What an epic failure for a supposedly professional company, a large carrier, the kind someone might book with and book first class because they are known as a reliable company! Don't be fooled, they are none of that if they cannot get a passenger to a city like Cleveland Ohio on a day they ticket you for. Not a holiday, not a busy time of year, nope, just a bungling company with terrible service that can't deliver on their service. This day cost me two uber riders to and from my home, it cost me food all day while I waited and waited being promised time and time again the flight would be leaving, I think a total of 6 times before I was told to take a hike because I wasn't making my trip today, I was told I could book with another airline and that they were out at this point. I could get a refund for my unfulfilled ticket by Delta. Of course when I asked that would my having to rebook on another airline today at a hugely inflated last minute ticket, would they include that on my refund, they were not taking any responsibility for that. Just go away sir and have a nice day. The only thing that went well at all, was the refund person that answered the phone in a reasonable amount of time and was very nice while quickly refunding my card. So apparently they do well at refunds, likely due to lots of practice! I always thought Delta was one of the top dogs in the industry, I mean I would have not been surprised if they were a small company like Elite, Spirit or Frontier, but Delta? They can't fix a screw up delay to a city like Cleveland? So I had to go home and not make a trip to do business for a couple of days because I chose a company like Delta, because I chose to trust my flight need to Delta.

Delta, without any notice or email or compensation or anything, put someone in the middle seat between me and my mom. All 3 of us were confused as Delta has a policy to not do this, so we consulted the gate agent who was more than happy to re-seat her since there was a few no-shows. However, this should not have happened in the first place. Normally my experiences on Delta are 10/10 but unfortunately this was just not the same. Some flight attendants on the 2nd flight also seemed a bit cranky and not happy to be there, though some were very nice as well.

I was moving from OKC to Denver, so this was a one way flight. Although there were nonstop flights to Denver I could've taken out of OKC, I chose Delta regardless if I had to take two flights to get to my destination cause they still had social distant seating on all their flights. Which made me feel comfortable since it'd be my first time flying since the pandemic started. Check in at OKC wasn't a hastle. Since I have a Gold Card, they still accepted my bag even though it was a few pounds over the limit. At the gate, I spoke to the agent handling boarding about the precautions. She was very nice and descriptive about their cleanliness and cleaning procedures. She was kind enough to give me a goodie bag filled with cookies, sanitizing wipes and a thank you post card. Flight to SLC from boarding to landing was ontime, smooth and pleasant. Connection at SLC was a little surprising. I learned we'd be deplaning at a remote spot and be bussed to the terminal due to construction I wasn't aware they were doing on some of the terminals. When we deplaned, we had to share two buses with another flight that had just arrived. Both buses ended up being at full capacity. Meaning we weren't able to social distance for the entire bus ride. In this environment, that was dangerous to do. I feel Delta could've done a better job mitigating this issue. Afterwards, the rest of the connection was fine. Boarded, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants on the flight were nice enough to let me move to an empty row because of my discomfort of sharing a row with another passenger, even though the middle seat was open. Overall, great experience with Delta in a pandemic. If they could just be more cautious about their remote stand connection process, that would be best. I have plans to fly Delta again in a month while they still have their social distant seating arrangement. Looking forward to it and experiencing a different connection process in SLC.

I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content. So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded. This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box the agent said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to the agent , he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me. I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly Spirit.

When it came time that we felt we could use the credit they had a policy in place saying they couldn't change the name attached to the ticket. My wife (who originally purchased the ticket) was going to use the credit instead of me. They would not allow the change even though it was the same family, trip, customer, and even credit card. It's sad when a company clearly only cares about the money and in no means the customer. You would hope that eventually no one would continue to support businesses like this that take advantage of people during hard times or any time for that matter. If you were paid then you were paid.

I bit the bullet and said sure, go ahead and do that. I wake up, May 25th and Delta went ahead and changed my flight back to the original of my flight(s) all being on the same day.

I wanted to take this time to highlight the good. On March 13th I was in Miami and the corona-virus was becoming a huge issue and my mom thought it would be a good idea that I flew home and I too thought it would be a good idea so I proceeded to book my flight to leave the following morning. When I booked the flight I thought I put insurance on the ticket turns out I did not. The next morning came and unfortunately I missed my flight I was a bit upset but not surprised because I honestly was not prepared. Knowing that I had not put insurance on the ticket I was upset that I would now be out of $130. With everything going on, money no matter the amount, is very much needed for rainy days but I knew that my own irresponsibility had put me in this position so I just let the situation go. So fast forward to today, March 31st, I had got paid and when I went to go check my account there was an extra $130 in my account. Of course at this point I had forgotten all about the ticket and I had already knew I didn't buy the ticket insurance so I was not at all expecting any type of refund. So I went in my payment history to see where the money had come from and sure enough it said ""Delta Airlines"". That's the difference between a good company and a GREAT company. I just wanted to say I truly appreciate the Delta community because they did not at all have to do that, but they did!

2020-02-25,1,10,"""never be flying Delta again""",Justin Saint,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. When it comes to choosing an airline, I am sure many would agree with me that the biggest factor in this decision is trust. Trusting the airline to get you to your destination safely. Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure. When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers. When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team.  It is safe to say that I will never be flying Delta again and I hope that my story will show others that Delta cannot be trusted.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'New York to Dallas Ft Worth', 'Date Flown': 'February 2020', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2020-02-11,2,10,"""no empathy, no compassion""",R Deane,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a flight from Cancun to Pittsburgh connecting through Atlanta yesterday. On my first flight, a cup of coffee was spilled on my lap after the passenger sitting next to me was bumped by the flight attendant and spilled her coffee. I accept accidents happen and I managed as best I could despite being wet and sticky. I shrugged this off and hurried to immigration/ customs. I have global entry and only had carry-on luggage and saw that there was a 2 hour earlier flight on Delta (15699) that would allow me to get home sooner, out of my sticky clothes and permit me to surprise my 8 year old son by getting to his swim competition in time. From online, it appeared there were over 20 seats open in the main cabin. I stopped at the delta baggage desk right after Customs and asked if this was possible and they said yes but that I had to run up to the gate since it was already boarding. I did just that- I ran! I got myself from the F concourse to the B concourse, Gate 5 and the area was clear, the gate was open for another 5 minutes and was staffed by an agent. I had to rest for 30 seconds just to catch my breath. I explained the agent what the Delta agents had told me to do. His response- was flat and dismissive ""Are you a Delta Platinum member?"" ""Are you A Delta Gold Member?"" I said no to both queries. His next response ""Well then you will have to pay $75 for a ticket change."" I explained that the representatives had indicated this would not be a problem as there were so many seats open- I was already travelling on Delta and normally this flight would not be available to me book as the time between flights is too small to be permitted to book during the initial reservation. I explained how my clothes were now sticky as a result of the coffee being spilled on me. I explained about my 8 year old and wanting to get home. None of this mattered. I was nobody to the agent. My impression after this - Delta only cares about you if you are a Platinum or Gold member. (Ironically I had considered, an hour earlier while in flight, applying for the platinum card as my husband sits on the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and flies often for board meetings. Suffice to say- I will stick with my existing airline credit cards and skip Delta's card as I do not see myself electively travelling on Delta in the future). I begged the agent to call a supervisor - he did but he dawdled and the gate was just 2 minutes from closing. I watched painfully as the door closed and the plane took off and the agent didn't care. There was no empathy, no compassion. Nothing.  I couldn't believe that this Delta agent would let me stand there, bag in hand, knowing he could have been kind and allowed me to see my family earlier, see my son compete and offset my unfortunate 'coffee in the lap' experience. I couldn't believe that he let me sit there knowing how many seats were empty on that flight just to make a point -pay the $75 or wait without reason.

I have been flying with Delta for my whole life. 40+ years of flights and all over the world. But I'm starting to notice that their service is becoming as second rate as other airlines. I was recently flying home on Christmas Eve and was so early to the gate that me and my colleague decided to grab a quick bite very close by. As we sat there and eventually watched other passengers board, we finished our meal and headed back over to the gate. When we got there they informed us they had given our seats away. No intercom, no warning, nothing -- just oversold and a whole bunch of people trying to get to their families in time for Christmas. So they bumped us. The next two flights were also oversold and so we had to buy two new tickets to get home late that night. It took us 9 extra hours to get home and had to fly through Seattle instead of on the direct flight we had seats for. We got to SLC late and many passengers were trying to get to connecting flights. One woman, in particular, had a young sleepy girl and was carrying large bags. She had only a few minutes to get to her gate and was going to miss her flight. We picked up her bags and sprinted no less than a half mile to the other terminal and caught them as they were closing the doors. We told her a woman was coming with her baby and to please hold the flight. It was an honor to get this poor woman and her child on her flight and we saved Delta from her missing her plane on Christmas Eve. That would have been 100% their fault. Now - I just spent 2 hours on the phone hoping Delta would show us a courtsey of some kind of credit for having to spend an extra $750 on new tickets to get home. Their customer service talked over me, did not employ good English, was disrespectful and told me it was all my fault. Even if that's true - why would you not do all you can to save a customer or to take care of a customer who has been so loyal? Why be just like so many other airlines? Delta has become too big and is losing what made them special. I can't believe I'm saying this - but I will choose them last from here on out.

However, we took off almost 1.5 hours after the initial time and missed our connection. Had to stay in Seattle as the next flight wasn’t until the next day, Delta covered that. On the way back they over booked the flight and said we couldn’t board until 4 volunteers accepted $1000 to stay. I called and talked with Delta about this and the response was 2 $100 gift cards. (She did mention she was told to offer only $25 but did more because she felt bad) I talked to a staff member who was very apologetic and comforting. But I feel like that just isn’t good enough. They refused anything more because they paid for our dumpy hotel when we were stranded in Seattle. I’ll definitely be flying Alaska Airlines from now on, they have not one time let us down.

Most times it seems like the gate does manage to rearrange seats, but it’s an unnecessary stress/step. It feels like they separate basic economy passengers so (a) they pay to get seats together, or (b) Delta looks good by getting them back together.

Once on board, the service was excellent. This was our third international trip on Delta this year and the cabin crews are significantly better than most airlines I have flown recently (with the possible exception of some of the Asian airlines). After take off the crew gave out water bottles and amenity kits then followed that with a welcome on board drink. Then meal service with three options (outlined on the printed menu and flight schedule which had been handed out at the start of the flight). During the flight the flight attendants came through four times offering water or juice and I also saw the flight attendants bring drinks to those who requested them. Snacks were available any time at the back of the plane. A pre-arrival snack with more beverages was offered about an hour before the end of the flight. Just before arrival, the flight attendants came around with farewell candies (in this case mini Toblerone bars) and thanked everyone for flying Delta.

I payed a lot of money because this was a last min trip. I was traveling with my 4 month old baby girl. I had to change her diaper asap. I was closer to the front and they were giving out snacks and drinks at the back so I could not really go through to the back. So when I was heading to the front bathroom, the male flight attendant told we to wait aside (with his hand) so I waited, one person came out the bathroom, as soon as that happens another person from first class goes in and he sees her. She comes out, a second person gets up and goes into the bathroom, ( I can’t get to the bathroom fast enough as he made me wait behind the first class section) then a third first class person goes in front of me. At that point I’m getting upset because this flight attendant knows I’ve been waiting there - then I ask if the changing table is located in side the bathroom, I’ve never changed a diaper in an airplane before so I don’t know. He replies by telling me “I suppose“ But because I’m not first class he doesn’t nothing to help, and he was Very nice to the first class so I can see he’s got potential to be nice to me as well if I would of paid extra for first class. I finally was able to get to the bathroom to change my baby. 2 hrs later, I had to use the restroom. Again, I have to go to the front. Then I ask him if it’s being used. He reply’s with “I don’t know, what do you see the sign say”? With a very rude attitude. He was just over all a very rude flight attendant. I’ve been in many many flights and I’ve never been treated like a peasant. I guess I can expect this from spirit, frontier , or American, but Not United.

I never thought I would live to say this, but after my two experiences with Delta international new service, I am going to actually search Delta tickets over most European airlines, and reasons for that are many and concern the basic comforts required to be able to sustain flying long hours in a metal canister. We were positively shocked to receive a welcoming cocktail - in basic economy - and one of our favorite cocktails, peach Bellini. The cabin crew ran rounds with water and soft drinks, and also several rounds with hot drinks and alcohol. The wine is not bad at all. They give hot towels before meals. Food has been improved, too, and the white grape, cheese and toasted almond snack was delish, as was the salted caramel ice cream. The pizza twist served as a second snack was underwhelming, however, but pizza is not my favorite anyway. Nothing to object to cabin crew or pilots, they are up to the task, as they always have been, but the service and the little things that make up the 9 hours on the plane bearable, are much better. The flight was super smooth and we touched down on time.

He added that checks still had to be made prior to the flight and we should be taking off in around 25-30 minutes.

The breaking point which compelled me to write a feedback on this airline after flying with them for so many years came when they did not handle my luggage professionally. When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it.

I have tried calling the corporate line 3 times and no answer. I sent them a complaint requesting a call back, nothing. So now I’ll share my experience with everyone I can. Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didn’t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer. I was so frustrated that my friends I was traveling with decided to call as I was getting really frustrated. My screen did not work on the way to Hawaii. My wife’s screen did not work on the way back. I cannot believe the lack of customer support. Any business I can think of that I have had a negative experience with has tried to rectify the negative experience. I feel you have to beg for help with Delta. I personally feel Delta does not care about its customers. A follow up call or apology coming from Delta would have been highly appropriate.

Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket. Unfortunately for me, issues arose I can no longer take this flight. I tried to cancel the flight online, which I did, trying to get my refund, which I didn't. I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no. Not only that, but the representative on the phone sounded just as frustrated as I was. Lesson learned: I have to click two or three different links to learn what exactly what a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee"" is. On top of that, I should know not to trust what a big company shows at face value. Even if for some odd reason I would get the chance to take this flight, I wouldn't.

The chick at the counter proceeds to tell me they are not allowed to short check bags and I cannot collect my bag. Naturally, she says this 2-3 times before I beg her to give me a solution. She tells me to proceed to ticketing so i can buy a new ticket to Seattle and collect my bag there. When I get to ticketing, I explain my story for the 3rd time. She explains that she needs to call global before permitting my bag return. So she calls global and insists I pay a fee to collect my bag. 45 minutes later and extra $$$ I have my carry on.

We eventually made it to LaGuardia but missed our connecting flight to BTV. The next flight out of LaGuardia was around 9:30pm on 9/3/19 which was not acceptable. We spoke to an agent who found a flight out of JFK (DELTA 5120) leaving at 12:15pm on 9/3/19. When we arrived at LaGuardia, we sought out a Delta representative and explained our situation, he gave us a “distressed passenger” voucher for a hotel. We called the number and the only hotel available was the Crown Plaza - we were required to pay $231.85 (which was apparently the discounted rate). We then had to spend $40 on transportation from LaGuardia to JFK at 1am. The receptionist at the Crown Plaza stated that she had never heard of an airline making customers pay for their hotel room due to airline error/delays. We were not the only customers flying with Delta at this hotel who has this issue. Not only did we incur nearly $300 of unexpected/unnecessary expenses but we also lost a day worth of work and animal care fees.

Our seats felt like they had come out of someone's neglected car. On our China-bound flight, we were without the in-flight entertainment system for much of the flight. What was displayed was the ""rebooting"" routine. Once up and running, the entertainment consisted of a dozen, or so, uninteresting movies; along with some very brief documentaries. The music selection consisted of 30 minutes of your chosen genre. On a ten hour flight, 30 minutes of music is a pretty bad plan. On our return flight, ten days later, we were fortunate to have the entertainment up and running during most of the flight, but the entertainment was identical. Both my wife and I ended up watching the same film on both legs of the trip. Food is about as awful as I've seen on any airline. We knew enough to bring lots of our own food with us. Our ""comfort plus"" seating included meals that our boys didn't touch. Less than two hours into the return flight I very politely requested a few cartons of milk for our little ones, and learned that there were none. They apparently had only loaded twenty 4oz cartons of milk onto the plane to provide for 198 passengers for over 10 hours. I actually had three flight attendants show up at my seat to scold me, saying ""We're not 7-Eleven."" In my decades of flying, this was the first time that I was actually scolded after politely requesting a carton of milk!

At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation I was told I had been moved to accommodate other passengers who wished to sit together. Not OK.

Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldn’t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though “Finally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!” Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you don’t have money, you are worthless and don’t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldn’t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasn’t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business.

I was in tears almost with how frustrated I was. I was trying to get to Mississippi to see my brother off before he got deployed and also celebrate his birthday before he left. Fortunately the flight attendant was able to give me a care pouch and a hotel room although I had no access to my luggage and my cellphone was dying. Eventually I made it to Gulfport and spent time with my brother before he left for deployment. On my way back home, my flight from Atlanta to Detroit was delayed once again causing me to miss my connecting flight home. My mother who was 50 plus years old drove at midnight to come and get me from Detroit airport because they wouldn't give me a hotel room for the night and wanted everyone to stay the night in the airport. There was no remorse when I called customer service and explained everything to them. They told me they'd get back to me in seven business days for my refund for the last of my trip and offered me a $25 gift card. This was by far the worst experience and I will more than likely never fly Delta again. I was better off flying Spirit. Delta Charges too much money for them to be treating their customer's like this.

2019-08-18,3,10,"""now your fleecing my points""",G Purdo,"✅ Trip Verified | Delta CEO and policy makers, I’ve been a loyal Delta customer for almost my entire 30 year career, I live in Atlanta, your HQ. I not only fly Delta, I pay for the sky club every year and I have a Delta American Express card. Even though I have to consider all airfare costs, all the time for my company, I prefer Delta and choose Delta whenever possible, until now. I have spent decades building up my points. Late nights, early mornings, delayed flights, 60+ overnight stays a year away from my family and more. It’s a lot of sacrifice to be able to take advantage of miles I’ve worked extremely hard for once or twice a year, only find out, Delta can manipulate markets and gauge customers like me and pull all those decades of earned miles right out of my pocket in an instance. And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancé is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. I’ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. We’re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse you’re having us leave an airport (Miami) we don’t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover. To make matters worse my fiancé can not afford to travel that day to Miami and back to Atlanta, because she only has a sitter for the Atlanta to Sau Paulo trip and we’re struggling to find a way to keep her in Atlanta, even if I have to go out of my way to Miami, just to protect some of my hard earned points. If I was to transition her ticket to the Atlanta portion only, the cost to my personal point status is crippling. I’m writing to you because I’ve been loyal for decades. I’ve supported Delta for decades (flights. Credit cards, sky club, etc). I’ve never complained. I’ve supported you and now your fleecing my points because you’re too rigid to solve this problem. I can’t accept the negative impact I’m being subjected to, after all the sacrifice I’ve withstood to earn my points. I don’t accept it. You tag line, printed on your napkin (see photo) states, 'the world is better without you in it'. What you’re doing to me, my fiancé, her daughter and our trip flies in the face of this tag line. You’re supposed to encourage us to venture out, travel, adventure, etc.. Not discourage us and penalize us. I’m not some one-timer. Look at my vast history. The fact that you’re setting markets up for price gauging with a personal impact to someone like me, is completely opposed to your messaging. So if you’re going to be an impediment to your own tag line, I’d suggest you stop using it.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Seat Type': 'Business Class', 'Route': 'Miami to Natal', 'Date Flown': 'July 2019', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Food & Beverages': 4, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 5, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

My Husband and I celebrated our 1-year Anniversary and thanks to Delta to give us a horrible ending to our vacation. It first started in Miami where there were 2 or 3 delays for the flight from Miami to Atlanta, there were no announcements regarding why the delays were happening and no information given whatsoever. The weather was a little overcast sky, but that was it. Once we finally boarded the aircraft, we landed in Atlanta 15 minutes after our connected flight had already left. We were not sure what our next steps were, so we went to the Delta Help counter on Concourse A where we encountered a nasty, condescending, rude, disrespectful employee. It was bad enough that we were upset that we missed our flight, but to make matters worse to endure her and her unpleasant attitude. First of all, in Miami there was no reason given why our flight was delayed and then when we got to Atlanta we had to stay in the airport all night and were not compensated or reimbursed for anything, not so much as a blanket, a cup of coffee or water. I understand that things happen but to be treated in the matter of which we were is Unacceptable and definitely not customer-oriented or customer friendly, at all. From the first delay, where there were no updates, to the rude employee, to no compensation for anything, not to mention that my husband and I missed a day of work and missed wages and had to pay an extra day of parking at our original destination where we had parked and pre-paid.

Asked for the other vegetarian meal that people who did not preorder got and it was great. Cabin crew were extremely attentive and did a drinks service every 45 minutes.

We planned our honeymoon following immediately after for Monday Aug 5th, 2019 to Saturday Aug 10th, 2019 to Oranjestad, Aruba. Though we’ve never flew with Delta airlines before, there were no worries that our honeymoon would be amazing. When we arrived to the Delta check – in , there was an older gentlemen who was kind enough to help get our luggage checked in, he stated that he had just sent us off to Aruba and that some sort of gratuity would be in order, we tipped him and went on our way. Things were running smooth, however, instead of departing at 7:00 am like our boarding passes stated, Delta flight 1080 to ATL start boarding at 7:00 am, which posed no issue at the time us, because my husband and I were present at the gate. Although boarding to ATL was passed time, the flight made good timing. We arrived in ATL at 9:50 am instead of 9:31am like our boarding passes and check in stated. My husband and I had assigned seats in the back of the plane, separately in rows 35 B and 35 F. It took a total of 20 minutes to get off the Delta flight 1080 from STL. We got off from our flight around 10:10 am, unlike other airlines we have been on, Delta requires you to go see a monitor for further instructions on boarding. My husband and I immediately went to the nearest monitor to locate the appropriate gate for our connecting flight to Aruba. In the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, there is a train that connects at each gate. The gate assembly starts at T, then A, B, C, D, E. it took my husband and I a total of 15 minutes to get from off flight 1080 to Gate T, then Gate E. GATE E 14. The gate that will forever be in our memory. Delta Flight 655, Departure time was set for 10:41 am on our boarding passes and once we arrived at gate E 14 at 10:28 am. Our flight was gone. Boarding had ended, and our fight had fully departed. My heart sank, we were in disbelief. Frantic, I ask the Delta representative at gate E 14 where our plane was and the gentlemen stated that the flight left at 10:26 am. My husband and I spoke with several representatives who were rude and unempathetic as they made things seems as though it was our fault that we were late. I was honestly unable to comprehend why our flight was gone and it was well before 10:41 am. Absolutely devastated, my questions meant nothing to anyone. There was even a gentleman who worked for Delta who felt it was appropriate to tell us that he called us on the intercom to board while we were on our way from our first flight because they knew we had checked in from our previous flight from STL. We were offered a complimentary flight for the next day only after we asked to speak to a supervisor. Defeated, we accepted with no choice. We asked for a complimentary room for Delta’s inconvenience and we were laughed at by the Supervisor. My husband and I spent the first day of our honeymoon in the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. (over 24 hours)  My husband and I had no luggage as we spent the night in an unknown State. We were responsible for late check in fees to our resort in Aruba.

Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers.

I hate that I’m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minor’s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasn’t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the “contract I signed”. I informed them that I clearly haven’t signed anything, because it’s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didn’t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without  tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didn’t believe them but I wasn’t going to waste time asking for management after the way I’d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said “you need to stay back” I just looked at her like “I’m just trying to hug them goodbye” and even another mom came up to me and said “they have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?” And if only she knew the half of it. You’d think this review stops here, but it doesn’t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadn’t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and we’re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport.

He asked for a moment to talk with someone behind the counter and he returned saying I am good to travel today (August 6th) for no more charges or anything.

Understandably, we were delayed from a 9:25pm flight due to bad weather (thunderstorms, rain, etc), and they had to search for a new route to take. This took 3.5 hours, which I guess is justifiable when looking for a safe route. HOWEVER, for some reason we had to make a stop in Minnesota for a pilot change. The flight crew assured us that a new one would be waiting at the airport so it’d be a quick stop so we can get back on our way. Sure why not, maybe the pilot was supposed to be off around our original departure time. BUT, it takes 2.5 hours to get from New York to Minnesota and on top of the 3.5 hour original delay, they had 6 hours to find a new pilot. Guess what? When we arrived at the airport there was no pilot available. They told us it’d be another 3 hour delay annoying literally everyone on board because they couldn’t find another pilot to take over. It was 3am when we arrived, so we leave again at 6am. Well guess what, 2 hours into the wait they said it’s likely going to be an extra 1.75 hours (departure now 7:45am) because they STILL couldn’t find another damn pilot to fly the stupid plane. This comes to a total of around 8 hours of flight delays with half of the time not being due to weather anymore, but incompetence.

We have a water front condo with two bedrooms and a car rental that we lost out on. The next day we have to check our bags in all over again. My husband and I wait in line to check our bags in.

2019-07-07,1,10,"""luggage was missing from her flight""",S Keale,"Not Verified |  New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today. As someone who travels every year, I will do my best to ensure that those whom I know don't travel with Delta and that I don't take a flight associated with Delta again.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'New York to Paris', 'Date Flown': 'July 2019', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 3, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

When we got to Orlando Delta lost one of our fellow passengers luggage and said “whoops we’ll see if we can send it to your house later”, the lady whose luggage was lost was in tears and the Deltas employees flippant attitude made it worse. Delta had to cancel a flight to Georgia due to the weather in LaGuardia even though other flights were still taking off. Because they blaimed weather that affected no other flights the people whose flights were cancelled were not compensated. The gate changes are almost impossible to keep up with too. As I write this horrible review I am waiting for a flight that has yet again been delayed last minute. I lost a day at Disney due to Deltas incompetence. Here is my parting advice Delta does not care about you they just want your money they will lie to you and cheat you and swindle you because in the end they know you’ll come back if the flights are cheap enough.

The flight from Boston was a little delayed and landed at 10:32 but taxied another seven minutes. We knew our connection was tight but no flight attendants helped. It used to be that they would announce close connections, allow those people to get off first. Not here. We were at the back of the plane and didn't de-board until 10:44. We had twenty-four min to make our connection in another part of airport. I asked gate attendant to call ahead and let them know we were coming. He shook his head no and we started at a dead run. Me and family (four of us) We made it there at 10:58. The gate was closed. They closed a full 15 min early, knowing they had a close-connecting flight. A couple there who were in the front of our plane arrived two min earlier than we did. The gate was not closed because it's ""regulation"" to close 15 min prior to take off. It closed 15 mins prior to take-off to board their standby employees. That's what I was later told. I would like proof of this but don't have it. Delta has it. The next morning June 13 we took a flight (DL3467) to Tulsa departing at 8:25. It closed its gate at 8:21. Four minutes prior to take-off. So it is not a regulation. Six people I know of missed the flight the night before because Delta breached our contract and inflicted emotional distress in order to further their own causes by boarding their own people. When we went to customer service that night, they refused to pay for the hotel because the plane was ""not that late."" They blamed us for missing the flight. I told them that was unacceptable and they finally made a call and okayed ours and everyone's overnight stay (found this out later on bus to hotel).

But we spent the night sleeping on airport chairs. No apologies, no offer of pillows, no offer of blankets, etc. Delta is unfriendly and does not care about its customers.

2019-06-26,1,10,"""was absolutely horrific""",Anna Grady,"✅ Trip Verified |  My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do.  After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome. Because Delta is not affiliated with Norwegian , they could not help me rebook my international flight and I lost my money on the ticket, a day of my vacation, and multiple tours and bookings due to multiple issues on Delta's part.

So here is my daughter a mess at the airport no flight. I contacted several people at Delta whom were all pleasant to speak with and trying to be very helpful the whole process. After being on hold and different people it was now 11 pm and couldn't do anything more. Next morning 6:30 Am called and spoke with a Jack in Dallas, who took the situation and quickly helped me place my daughter on the next direct flight to London. No up charge and excellent service.

We label the machine in lime green duct tape with large letters stating it’s a medical device. This machine was pink tagged by Delta as well meaning it cannot go on a luggage carousel. We traveled from Atlanta to Puerto Rico on June 7th. When we landed our machine was not waiting on us to deboard the flight. We were told that the device had been thrown into the carousel. This is a $4000 machine and a life or death device for my husband and they overlooked the markings and tags and just threw on the carousel. They did realize their mistake and radioed the luggage department. However they did not advise us of any of this. We spent 20 minutes looking for the machine on the carousel. I finally decided to look for someone and found the luggage office. Our device was in the office!! This special $500 car that transports it was damaged luckily the machine was not. When a complaint was made the pulled the pink tagged marked by Delta it was under the wrong name!! Had this luggage been lost we would have never been able to get it back.

I was shocked as frequent flyer who travels Business Class for international travel with a variety of airlines. At this point I am wondering how Delta allowed this person to pass the needed classes and training given. She did not know how to make Delta's signature cocktail which is highlighted in the menu card given. So much for the cocktail that Delta raves about. I ended up having to take a coke zero twice. Fastforward to morning time about six hours later before landing at AMS. The same person is working my side this time she walks by for breakfast I ask for Coffee and she has to move the cart as to others wanting to use the bathroom and then totally forgets to serve us breakfast.

I was a bit surprise how long the boarding takes, because of all the small groups being called to get to the gate. That explains why I have to be at the gate so early. But how cares as long as it works. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful. It was a lot of fun to chat with them. They were great and very professional. Although we should not forget that they are on the flight for safety reasons and not only as waitresses and waiters. But I have my doubts that the age group of flight attendants during my flight is still able to do that. One flight attendant stumbled twice over a slight step on the floor. After so many years that should not happen any more. To make sure, it is not about youth and beauty, this is about safety. The service was excellent the food was fine and nothing to complain. The WiFi during the flight just for messages was amazing. I spend a lot of time by sending messages around the world. The seat was really old and not very comfortable. The length is okay but the width did not work at all. I was sorry that the new seats were not available. A big plus for me was the matter that my luggage could get through to Mexico.

As a result of the assigned places I was left with no menu option once the option of meat was finished at lunch on the first intercontinental flight and on another flight, that of the three-hour delay, due to the host's incompetence, we were not served the drink at that we were entitled and for which we paid for ""lack of time""  Let's see what reserves this flight ...

I booked a trip on Delta traveling from Atlanta to Milan via New York for a 9 day back country ski trip in the alps. The flight from ATL to NY was delayed over 2 hours leaving only 1 hour after landing in NY until the flight to Milan was taking off. I had 2 bags; one for skis and one for clothes and equipment. The skis made it onto the flight to Milan. The other bag did not. After arriving in Milan I was assured that the bag would arrive the next day and would be delivered to my hotel that was several hours away in the alps. The bag did arrive the next day to Milan, but it ended up held up in the airport for 3 days because the baggage company only delivers on Wednesday. By Wed, our group had moved to another country and needed the bag delivered to the new country. Trying to arrange for that with Delta was a complete waste of time after spending numerous hours on the phone with them. They never connected my bag to me for the entire 9 days that I was away. They ultimately delivered it to the wrong country. I had to track it down and pay someone to deliver it back to the airport at the end of the trip so that I would be reconnected with my clothes and equipment to go back home with me. I heard a lot of lip service from Delta about how much they valued my platinum medallion status , but it was all lip service and no action on their part. Delta was worthless in making any effort to connect me to my bag, and equipment that I needed for backcountry skiing. Additionally worthless was their compensation, or lack thereof, for making me go 9 days without the clothes and equipment that I needed. If you really need something for your trip I recommend contracting with a 3rd party delivery service company to get your stuff overseas, because you can't count on Delta at all. What a horrible experience. I have booked flights on Delta before when I could have paid less to fly their partners overseas. From now on, I'll be booking those flights with their partners instead and saving money since Delta showed my no loyalty nor benefit to book with Delta instead. I was flying exclusively with Delta. Now, I'm a free agent. Loyalty needs to work both ways, and did not for that trip.

Typical I hear for Florida which is out of the airlines control I understand. That's where the understanding ends. Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is. Oh just to add, my flight home now my wife and I are in non connecting seats and the gate customer service couldn't ""print tickets"" so I had to write down all the information on our receipts from the previous night, she didn't even have the courtesy to do that for me.",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 737', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Florida to Sacramento via Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'May 2019', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

This process took them 2 hours. Given their delay and incompetence, I missed that flight and had to go back to the check-in counter. I was told that they couldn't get me on another flight until the next day. I was forced to find a hotel and pay for it on my own. My luggage had been sent on ahead and so I had no change of clothes and no toiletries. The next day I departed as scheduled. On my flight I was not served a meal which I had preordered and the television monitor did not work. It didn't matter because I was not provided with headphones and so I spent the entire 7-hour flight with nothing to do. I was not able to sleep because I was in an aisle seat and the flight attendants were going back and forth and kept bumping into me all night long. When I arrived at my final destination (36 hours late) my luggage had been lost and that took another 40 hours to deliver to me. I requested compensation from the airline several times and was denied. The bottom line is that they simply do not care about their customers. At the very least they should have covered the cost of the hotel and refunded my luggage fee but they chose instead to be greedy and uncaring. Their attitude and lack of service are terrible.

Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again.

It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response “You better run”! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didn’t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they won’t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasn’t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, would’ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didn’t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and I’m quoting “you don’t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didn’t make the flight,” You should’ve ran faster”. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied “good luck”. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when they’re 50 gates apart! Yes, I’ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you don’t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely don’t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, they’re extremely unprofessional and rude!

And one particular customer service rep at the counter decided that it was a good idea to offer a voucher/discount for a hotel to one couple but not other families! Why the discrimination? She also provided the worst flights for us to choose from to make it an even horrible experience. But yet other customers had better flight options. I have never had this experience when flying. The worst customer service! It’s absolutely disappointing and at the same time surprising that I’ve had better contacts with Spirit. Southwest waits for its customers. And no discrimination between first class and those who can’t afford it. Oh and the reps who refused to provide exceptional customer service at the Delta counter in Atlanta and made the experience even worse. So for those who choose to fly using Delta, that’s what you expect to deal with. If you have a layover, not even because of the weather, will they wait for you. They will put you on the worst available flight even though there are better flights with only first class seats available. Delta will not give up their first class seats to you because you paid for economy though “weather” screwed up your layover.

I think one ""special"" boarding will do, and 2) There were no pillars for Main 3 and Basic Economy (last two boarding groups).

The flight to Mexico was with Aeromexico (in partnership with Delta). We arrived at the MSP airport the morning of departure and the parking garage was full so we were directed to park at a different airport, which we did, but had to take two light rails and drag two kids and our luggage up and down countless escalators and long corridors before we reached the Delta desk to check in (nearly an hour later). We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldn’t help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a ‘Hail Mary’ idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn’t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we “no-showed” they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren’t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn’t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I’m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta.

It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay.

I responded with the same question, how long is the flight (I was not rude but tired and out of breath), his response with an absolutely rude and condescending smile was “hello”. Then both the lady attendant and male attendant laughed at me and said, boy he’s rude and then laughed again. I was shocked and never did receive an answer to my simple question. My flight from Austin to Salt Lake was a horrible flight.

Called the company and can only do it over the phone, and now was forced to pay an additional 20$ to the 40$ increase already, to a ""main cabin fee"" vs basic economy(which I originally purchased) because it is their policy. After much complaining and speaking with supervisors I was finally given the basic economy price-still 40$ more than my originally purchased ticket.

They were actually getting snow on the peaks of Haleakala. We were told to go grab our luggage, but TSA was closed once we got down there, so we weren’t able to go back upstairs in the warm enclosure. Those who stayed up there were given blankets, pillows, and water, but the 6 of us downstairs were left to fend for ourselves. And that’s just we’re the drama began. One thing after another, over and over again, we dealt with issues from the Delta employees. People who didn’t know what they were doing whatsoever. More delays, sending info for the wrong runway, and BS from employees in Utah once we finally landed, 3 hours late, at 2:30 AM. 48 hours of no sleep, rude and ignorant employees, and no info relayed to those of us on the flight.

Most disturbing, though, is the quality of the interior. It is very evident that costs were cut, as things are breaking down quickly. On this current flight, the window shade was stuck in the closed position as it looked like it was off-track. On another flight, it was a broken lavatory door. On a third flight, the lavatory light didn't work so you had to use the facility in total darkness.

Our flight was in the evening and it hadn't been foggy for at least 6 hours. However, about an hour before our departure Delta canceled a few flights including ours. They rebooked us on a flight leaving at about 11am the next morning and handed us meal vouchers that only covered a basic Subway sandwich with old browning veges. We asked the Delta agent for help and were booked on a flight that was leaving that night but the agent said it was weird because only about 5 other passengers were booked. We thought that was great of Delta to open another flight and expected the flight to fill quickly with the other stranded passengers. But a few minutes later we saw a man with a Delta badge approach the agent and tell her the flight was only to transport a pilot and co pilot with a full sized empty plane to salt lake city (our destination) and no passengers were allowed because there wasn't a flight crew.  Why was that flight allowed to leave and not ours? Why didn't Delta scramble and come up with a crew for that flight!? What a waste. I'm not a crier, especially in public but I couldn't hold back the tears and it's not like there is anywhere secluded to go in an airport for privacy. So my husband and I had to stay the night in the airport and watched for openings on earlier flights. Thankfully we found a flight out at about 6am but we were up all night hungry, exhausted and I was completely humiliated. I had also called Delta's customer service asking for help but they said to talk with the agent at the airport. It was especially important for us to get back to Salt Lake because I had a surgery consultation at 10am in Salt Lake, that I had been waiting about 5 months for. We went straight from the airport to the appointment disheveled and gross. Ironically my appointment was for my foot which was swollen like a melon after sitting in the airport for over 12 hours. I used to recommend Delta to everyone but they've changed.

The food onboard was inedible, and the wine selection poor. The ONLY good thing about Delta Airlines, was the use of the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class lounge at Heathrow.

We weren't offered to stay in a hotel close by and I even had to ask the staff for something to eat. We landed in Atlanta around 3am and were charged a no show fee at the hotel. We also had to pay for the transport to the hotel as airport shuttles don't run at this time. AF customer service that's supposed to take care of that refused to compensate us as it is a US company operating a US flight. Doesn't matter that we booked from Air France. Is it really our problem that they delegate the flight to a partner?

So we fly quite often between the two, and we also travel a lot for leisure. So we decided to use around the world tickets, the advantage being it allows you to make stops, change flight schedules etc. without penalties. Additionally, we opted to go Business class with 1st class flights with the latter being carriers who do not have business class. There is an unspoken expectation that if you upgrade, you will be allowed to use the lounge. Long story short, wrong. We flew from Paris to Detroit. Stopped in Detroit, MI for a few days, then flew to Reno, NV. We were able to use the business lounge in Paris, but not able to use the business lounge in Detroit, stating that we could only use it if we continue on to Reno on the same day. Or basically flying continuously around the world? WTF? I am not trying to be entitled or ask for special treatment, but when you pay for business or first class tickets, there is an expectation that you can use the lounges. So I tweeted to Delta and they asked me to PM them with my complaint/feedback. Response I got, it’s basically their policy, and they’re not making exceptions. Again, I was not asking for special treatment nor do I feel as though I am entitled, but there is an expectation when you pay 3-times that of economy. I write this to let other’s know, because you have choices for around the world tickets. I like flying business because, call it paranoia, but I like being at the airport early so as not to miss my flight, and having the comfort of these lounges. Delta really needs to look at their “around the world policy” as it relates to usage of their lounge. This is the response I got from Delta. “Thanks for your patience, Randy. I have further reviewed policies and we strongly enforce these guidelines. Please know we regret the disappointment as we value your business and choice of airline.

I arrived about 1.5 hours before my flight departed, so this was less than a 3 hour window. About half way to the airport, I was notified of a 2 hour delay. This was understandable given the conditions. However, Delta kept pushing back the flight at that point in 1 and 0.5 hour increments all the way until 5:40. In this time, all I could do was wait. While Delta did provide food for the many people waiting, it certainly was not very good (cheap pizza and water) and not enough for everyone. They even ran out of plates for people. Finally, when the plane arrived, the passengers were told that the crew could no longer work, and we were forced to wait another 3.5 hours while they tried to find a crew. Given they knew about this storm and the delay, they should have been aware of the crew's inability to work more hours and have a standby crew ready. After finally boarding the plane at 9pm, almost 12 hours after arriving at the airport, the passengers learned we still didn't have a co-pilot and were forced to wait another 1.5 hours.

Mistakes happen in life, and this time Delta made a (from my understanding) fairly rare error resulting in my luggage being lost for a month. I realize this happens from time to, but expect when it does for it to be handled professionally. I have never seen such inadequate and unprofessional management of what one would assume to be a simple situation. Repeatedly my Delta agent simply ignored my requests for information related what Delta was offering to cover and what they were denying—I still have no idea what exactly is being covered. Furthermore, the agent ignored my requests for a phone call--when she final addressed the request she said the time difference was too great despite my offering to take the call at any time no matter how inconvenient it was for me. I had to drive the entire conversation with the agent frequently taking over a week to get back to me even after multiple follow-up emails from my end. I spent about 15 hours of my own time handling this situation and in the end Delta provided me with a $250 voucher for the $2,000+ ticket and is covering 75% of my cost and the damage to my personal things.

First was called by Delta the partner in the flight with KLM, called and told us they were changing our flight with a 24 hr lay over ""as crew couldn't find a place to stay for the night in Panama City due to the storm"". Never mind that we looked up and found several places on the beach. In any event, this meant we would have to add another day of expense and change our flights to 5:55 AM, meaning we also lost all ability to submit our VAT refunds among other things, but the worst was yet to come. On checking in the 'lady' at the gate told us we could not carry on our policy size and weight carry on bags, as the ""flight was full"", yet the bags had important medical equipment, medicines and fragile expensive goods that we had no ability to lock up as we were told the bags would be able to be carried on. If the bags were lost or damaged replacing the equipment and meds would be extremely hard even once back home. The worst part-every other passenger behind us and at other gates for the same flight were being allowed to carry on their bags as advertised. CWhen confronted about why this was the case the gate attendant told us ""call direct if you like its in the policy fine print, we can do this to you"" She then became belligerent and gave one word answers, didnt look at us and said 'next"". When I tried to ask if wheelchair assistance had been confirmed, she spouted off a series of gate numbers where I could go ask for a wheelchair, and rushed us out of line. I then returned to the gate as her info wasn't sufficient, and asked another gate attendant who simply stuck her finger in the air and said ""over there somewhere"" and didn't even look at us.  Wheelchair assistance either wasn't at the gates or was very late and we had short connect flights and couldn't just hope it showed up. My son and wife  had to almost carry me at a run to the next gate. The only connection this didn't happen at was Atlanta and then only because we we hunted down a wheelchair attendant when ours wasn't there. The gate attendants were disrespectful, dismissive, and left us genuinely concerned given my inability to walk the distances due to legitimate neurological disease for which I carried medical proof- They forced us to check bags that others were carrying on board -passengers of the same ticket class as us. In fact nearly every other passenger boarding had their bags, The only difference in us and other passengers. -we had a disabled passenger.

When I left the Sky Club in JFK terminal 4 and headed to the nearby gate roughly 10 minutes before boarding, I got a text from Delta that the departure gate was changed. It was a non-issue unless the new gate was in terminal 2, and the only way to get there was by bus. To make things more confusing, the text did not advise me where I could take the bus, which departed from another gate. When I made to T2, an old, small and overcrowding facility, the flight was delayed because they needed to transfer the food, which had already been loaded to the original aircraft at the original gate, to the new aircraft (?). I ended up arriving at Frankfurt late, and the delay was not caused by weather or any technical issue. Reading many reviews here, one can easily notice that many complains about US carriers are about delays and how the airlines handle the situation, and that was what exactly happened here with Delta. The 767 perhaps has the best economy class seating arrangement, with only 1 per row that is not either a window or an aisle seat. The 767-400 used for my flight had the old version of IFE which was not that great (Delta's 767-300ER had better, newer IFE). I paid for wifi (the free version never works) and it worked fine. Service and food were fine. Crew distributed bottle water after meal (without us asking) which I think was a nice touch for us to stay hydrated throughout the flight.

The flight from Binghamton --> New Orleans was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-5 Then, this was how it happened. My first flight was delayed for 1h30min, and of course, I missed my connecting flight. I have to stay in a hotel overnight in Detroit. I don't have much time with my family this trip, and now I have to spend 1 night in the middle of nowhere. I was really mad with them, they gave me a voucher $100, and at least I felt they care about my feeling. At that point, I can rate them 4 stars. The flight was delayed, but the reaction was good. The flight from New Orleans --> Binghamton was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-10. Again, the first flight was delayed for ""2 hours"". And again, I have to stay in Detroit 1 more night. I can't imagine how my trip 5 days with 4 days with my family turned into 6 days with 3 days at home. I contacted them about my issue, now the attitude was changed, they thought that they gave me $100 voucher and it's done. I deserve to have the delay one more time ""on the same trip"". They sent me to a hotel name Travelodge, it's a very very bad hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 11:30PM and hadn't had dinner yet. I was thirsty and need some water. Since I don't have cash with me so I ask the help desk at the hotel for some water. After I said I don't have cash, she told me to drink water in the bathroom, ""it's OK!"".  Now the wifi doesn't work, but I have to write this because I am really mad now. The lesson is: you may have a fault, but the way you fix it is more important. For the person who thought that $100 voucher is big, and it's ok to wait 2 nights for 2 delays on the same trip, I'm ashamed of you, you are so cheap!

I was bumped off of 6 flights because of availability. It was time for the last flight out and I was very nervous. They called my name to board the plane and I was very relieved. I got settled on the plane and started reading my book. All of a sudden the flight attendant called my name and another gentleman’s name. Right before the plane was getting ready to take off they told both of us that we had to give up our seats. This was one of the most degrading experiences of my life! The supervisor made us get off the plane and give up our seats. The other person working for the airline told me she wasn’t supposed to do that because the people didn’t arrive until the plane was about to leave. This was the same supervisor that told me to board the plane. The supervisor showed no remorse whatsoever. I'd been at the airport since 930 am and now I’m going to miss work and not be able to get home to my pets! One of the delta employees that was working one of the flights I was bumped off earlier told me that the airport had an agreement with the local hotels for discounted rates for people that were displaced because of issues with flights. The supervisor told me that she was the only person I could speak with about my issue. She also didn’t mention the discounted hotel rates until I brought it up and the rates she told me were twice the amount of what the previous employee said. I understand that you aren’t guaranteed a seat flying standby but they shouldn’t treat people like they’re inferior.

We purchased 5 economy tickets for 2 adults and 3 children. When we checked in for the first flight to ATL the counter personnel made a snide comment about our tickets being basic economy and how lucky we were to have seats in the same row. For this first leg we had 5 seats in row 40 with 1 other passenger between us. That was good and we had a fine flight. When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty.

2018-09-07,3,10,"""getting rid of the Delta card""",Sherri Walls,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a first class trip for two on Delta Airlines using my Delta Sky-miles Platinum Card. We were flying from La Guardia to Houston. It’s about a four hour flight. For me, any flight over two hours I tend to fly first class. Unless, the ticket value is exceptional. Although I’ve held this card for sometime now, I’ve only flown first class twice on Delta. I generally use Delta to fly to Atlanta, which is approximately two hours. Anyway, the trip began with the rep at the gate informing us that we wouldn’t be able to sit together due to a broken seat. I was like that blows but whatever. Then I thought to ask the Delta Rep if maybe they could simply inquire with the passenger; who one of would be sat next to, if they didn’t mind switching to a different seat (still in first class but with no on occupying the seat next to it). I was told by the Delta Rep, that I should do it myself. Which, if that’s their policy, I get! He offered no other remedy. Maybe he could’ve said: hey, I realize it’s a bit of an inconvenience, separating you and if it’s important for you to be seated together; I could move you but you’d be losing first class service (which is much on Delta anyway). I just felt that there was no regard for professionalism. It matter of fact and deal with it attitude. The kicker was this, we boarded the plane and the “first class” Stewardess was no prize either. I will give this though, she did assist in getting us seated together. She then took drink and food orders. My order was taken first. Apparently, too many people ordered the chicken salad dish. She came back to me and here’s the dialogue: I can’t give you the chicken dish, you’ll have to have the pastrami sandwich. I said well I’ll pass, because I don’t eat pastrami. But how does that work anyway, you told me my choices and I selected like everyone else? She says we ran out of the chicken. I say, but you took my order first? She says well in looking at the medallion status, you fall to the bottom. What was so crazy about that is that I purchased both first class tickets and she brings my boyfriend the chicken salad! We both laughed like hell! Again, to her defense it could only be the Delta Airline to blame. No ideal how she decided he got to eat over me though. There is clearly no  training on tact or etiquette. And if I’m wrong in that statement; there is either no policy in place for common occurrences. The whole point of this review is to hopefully save anyone from wasting money on Delta first class. I’ve flown first class on American Airlines quite a few times also and have had zero complaints.

At any point I was not contacted by Delta airlines with instructions, received any support or voucher to pay for the extra expenses I had to have or even an apology note. Having spent half of my time in Berlin without my luggage seriously impacted my time there as I was always concerned that my luggage might be delivered while I was out of the house. I didn't stay at a hotel and the building didn't have a doorman and no one would be there to pick it up. I was worried about not having my things back at all as I kept getting emails saying they had no idea where my luggage was, was always uncomfortable from wearing clothes borrowed from friends and generally just stressed out by the lack of care toward me from Delta.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Sao Paulo to Berlin via New York', 'Date Flown': 'August 2018', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Food & Beverages': 3, 'Inflight Entertainment': 2, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

In fact, we never actually ended up flying and did not make it to our destination. We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control; however, this is the first time I've been cancelled due to weather. In the past, I've been delayed for a long time, but not cancelled. We rebooked on another flight, this was 3 hours later, and it gets delayed due to weather/late inbound flight, and once it finally makes it to the gate, we get ready to board, and then the gate agent announces that the flight was cancelled again literally just as the plane is about to board. Some airlines like to keep delaying the flight and are really hesitant to cancel, where as Delta just decides to give up and cancel the flights. We went back to the counter and asked to rebook and there was one agent there who was literally the opposite of helpful, and he kept asking us to wait a minute, and then stand back, and to give priority to the people on the Paris flight, and my dad had to call his attention by saying, ""Don't worry about us. We're just customers going to go to New York,"" and the one woman that was standing next to him gave another sarcastic remark, and then they walked away. We waited an hour and a half on the phone to ask if we could be reimbursed. They were willing to give us our money back. I've flown Delta many times without incident, but I have to say I was quite disappointed this time. I'm not saying I won't fly them again because I will, but this was an experience that really let me down.  They are usually good to us, but this was an experience that I won't soon forget.

They said ""sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can."" So the 3:30 flight was delayed until 4:45. I hung around hoping I could get on the flight. I tried again and Delta said that if the 8:20 is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight. I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed - sorry. Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats. The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it. The flight left. Not 10 minutes goes by and I get an email saying the 8:20 is delayed. Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers. They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra $75 but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another 4 hours. My flight has been delayed to 8:45 and I am betting it will be later than that. Fly Southwest - they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight. They are very accommodating easy to deal with and generally care about their passengers.

We were told the flight had been delayed for 10 mins. Come back the flight is delayed for another 10 mins. Come back again and the lady said if it is anywhere past 6:20 we have to come to the front to change our flights as we would miss our connecting. Again totally fine, I am in a line up with one person in front of me awaiting the new update (currently states 6:20 departure) - flights delayed until 8:45pm - again totally fine. Then things start going south. The line was told if we wanted faster service to take a red card and call the number to change flights so I take a card and step out of line as I had to meet my boyfriend to let him know what was happening. I call the airline and there isn't a single flight that night until the next day. Ok that sucks but fine... we both have to book off work the next day now and so I asked politely if there was anything that they could do to make the situation better (aka seat upgrade). Nope notta. Fine. Well can I continue booking my hotel then as I would hope you cover that. Sorry mam, but you have to go to the ladies at the gate to book a room - so now I have to go back to the same line I was encouraged to step out, again 1 person in front of me before. 1 and 1/2 hours later (4 hours since arriving at the airport) finally get to the front- again. I explain to the same lady who told me to step out of the line what happened and again politely asked for anything to make the situation better - again nothing. Standard hotel room and food vouchers which are only good at the airport  which we cant use for the meal we already ate while waiting for the delays. Then on our first flight they didn't seat us together and on the second connecting flight (2.5 hours) there were no TV's . This was pretty ridiculous there was zero customer service in handling the situation. We had to take another vacation day which we couldn't even take advantage of because anything worth going to in San Diego takes a full day. At the end of all of it they couldn't at least put us in Premium economy or give us credit we could use for something outside of spending more time at the airport or upgrade our room. I strongly suggest not taking this airline.

Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG.

Then that plane gets here and there are missing crew members we have to wait on. All in all it was delayed 3 1/2 hours. During all of this, when it is clear I won't make my connecting flight, we talk to customer service who says go ahead and get on the flight and the gate attendant will give you a hotel voucher when you get there because the flight I would be missing is the last one out. We say okay, no problem. I get there and go to the gate attendant. He says, you need to go to customer service. I go to customer service, stand in line for an hour, they say, go to a gate attendant. I go back to a gate attendant. By this time I am so angry and upset I am on the verge of crying, but I am trying to be polite to this innocent gate attendant that is getting caught in the crossfire. She finally takes pity on me, looks it up and says that she will give me a hotel voucher and gives me some tips about when to come back in the morning because it is one of their busiest times.

Ten minutes turned into changing the route, having to add fuel (a 45 minute venture) and adding half an hour to the new flight time. Don't fly with Delta. Instead of taking ownership over their mistakes (like not marking the flight as delayed or boarding us despite bad weather) they will instead treat their passengers horribly when they try to figure out what is going on and respond rudely when the passengers question when they will be leaving.

Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Tahiti. We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly. Flying out of Minneapolis on Delta we sat on the tarmac for over and hour because of mechanical/electrical issues. Even tho the issue was not fixed, de-icing proceeded and we left for take off. Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation. Trust me you do not want to shop in Tahiti on a Sunday for toothpaste/toothbrushes and swimsuits. Thank you Delta, it is much appreciated.

When I booked tickets on the Delta website earlier this year to fly from London to Costa Rica I got all the way to the final screen without any problems only to find that when I clicked 'Buy' a pop up screen appeared telling me that there was now a high demand for these seats and if I wanted them I'd have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more. Delta might find this to be a great way to screw extra money out of your customers (and after all, they are an American company) and it might even be legal; but it's dishonest, unethical and just plain wrong. I've never known this from any other airline in over 40 years of flying. Secondly, as we flew over the Atlantic my wife and I were on the extreme right hand side of the plane, the guy on the same row in seat A had his window open - everyone else had their windows closed as the sun was low and very bright. This caused everyone in the row to have very bright sunlight in their eyes, we all complained to the stewardess who told us that the guy needed to work on his computer and so needed the window open to see the keyboard, I have to note that the window was partially closed so there was no sunlight in his eyes, just everyone elses. No matter how many times we complained the stewardess refused to tell the guy to close the window, so this went on for several hours, it made it difficult to see the entertainment, it made it impossible to sleep and it  made the whole experience very unpleasant.  Given the way several US airlines have treated their passengers over the past year I doubt that I'll ever fly on an American carrier again, they obviously don't care about passengers. As a further point, Atlanta airport is the biggest dump I've ever had to spend any time in, I'll avoid it like the plague in future",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'London to Costa Rica via Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'March 2018', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta  and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more.

Not 20 minutes after I had fallen asleep, the Emporer of aisle 15 had gotten the flight attendant to ask me to evacuate “his” row. The attendant said that I was sitting in an economy plus row. No problem; I did not pay for an economy plus ticket and was more than happy to move to any other row with a reclining chair. I asked her to please tell me where I can move to another open seat. “Sure”, she says, and walks away. I gather my belonging and she comes back to say rudely “You have to move”. I asked if she knew which seat I could move to, and she said there should be some in the back. Super helpful.

I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times.",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 777', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Atlanta to Amsterdam', 'Date Flown': 'March 2018', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 3, 'Ground Service': 2, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

My outbound flight to MSP was delayed so much that I missed the connecting flight to SAN. Once I arrived in MSP, I was directed to the service desk for assistance. The Service Desk agent displayed absolutely no empathy and told me my next flight out was going to be with an additional connection through LAX. So I was originally going to get to SAN around 1pm. Now with the delays and re-route this was going to push me back to 9pm. I asked at the service desk if they compensate their customers in any way and she said ""Well, if you were here more than 8 hours we would give you a meal voucher and Delta feels if they get you there within 24 hours then that is the best they can do."" Her words, not mine. I was floored. So I asked her to terminate my trip in LAX and I would get my own transportation from there to SAN instead of sitting in the airport another two hours. I get to LAX and no bag! I ran like a mad woman to baggage services so that they could keep my bag from going on the connecting flight to SAN.

We paid higher than the ""going rate"" for our flight especially because we wanted a smooth overnight return so that we could return to work the day after return. The flight over was very good, we were impressed. But, our connection from Richmond to our NY overseas flight was suddenly cancelled. The ground crew hardly knew how to cope with such.

After much back and forth we were routed through Atlanta (still suffering from the hurricanes) and then Amsterdam. This was the longest return we'd ever experienced in our 30 years of regular travel between the UK/US. Needless to say we could not return to work the following day as planned. So initially we were very disappointed at how poorly Delta handled our return. We can only assume that the flight was cancelled because they hadn't the numbers, and thus the profit. This was the first clue of a problem. The confused and almost useless ground staff the second clue. Note that we had to work with them for a realistic return as their initial proposal did not allow adequate lay-over time in Atlanta given the airport size. Then on return I wrote a complaint to Delta. Next clue was that complaints are automated through a soulless computer process. Then I was warned that they were experiencing a high volume to customer service requests and while they hoped to answer in 30 days they could not promise. 30+ days, seriously? Well they passed our complaint, about Delta's handling of our custom, over the KLM who few the transatlantic flight. They must never had even read the complaint.

I had an important meeting to attend at noon on 01/08 so I requested Delta to put me on a flight on 01/07 night instead which they did. My new flight was from RDU to SEA via ATL with a stopover of 45 minutes. The flight from RDU to ATL got delayed by 15 minutes. The RDU ATL flight arrived at gate B18 and the ATL SEA flight was from gate E6. Why would they even suggest such an itinerary with 45 minutes of stopover. I ran my heart out and reached gate E6 10 minutes before departure but the door had already closed. There were plenty of other passengers with me. Could they not have waited for 10 more minutes? Was it so difficult to see that there are other people connecting to this flight who had landed just 10 minutes before, more so given the fact that the flight was the last flight for the night to SEA from ATL? After that, I got rebooked on a flight to SEA via SLC reaching SEA at 12:30pm on 01/08. So basically the reason why I prepone my flight to 01/07 in order to reach on time for my meeting, you are now taking me to SEA even after my original direct flight from RDU to SEA. I told the gate agent about that and she was outright rude. I said I have to attend the meeting and I will take a non delta flight and reach SEA on time for my meeting. She told me that I wont get any refund since I am already rebooked on a different flight.

So i waited an additional 1.5 hours to see why she was no longer on the itinerary. Turns out the delta rep who tried to change her flight information gave her a different itinerary number. To compensate, Delta gave us a $100 voucher to use to purchase any delta tickets. On the flight home she did not board as she needed to stay in Atlanta. So I allowed my nephew to sit in her seat that I already paid for. Deltas employees then made him get up and go to his assigned seat in the main cabin so one of their pilots could sit in the first class seat I paid for!

So, over the night we had 1 inch of snow in Portland and our flight was scheduled for 6:00AM. We get to the airport and see that the check in supposed to start at 5:20AM starts at 5:40AM.  We get jn the plane, it was already over 6:00AM and people were still finding their seats. I have to mention that our connecting flight in SLC was 30 minutes away from the PDX flight landing. This combo of flights was offered by the company I did not choose it specifically. Temperature outside was about 40 degrees no snowing, no raining and they had to deice the plane. Only that they started doing it at 6:15AM. Again, Our departure was scheduled at 6:00AM they start deicing at 6:15. Great customer service, especially after we got stuck on the tarmac for another hour so our plane ended up taking off at 7:15AM. We missed the connection in SLC. I go to the counter lady who of course told us that she will rebook us the second day. I said fine, so who is gonna cover our hotel and expenses? She said we do not cover that type of stuff when a delay is because of the weather? And here I give up, when you were already late with the boarding you act incompetent and start to deice the plane with 15 minutes after the departure time, when outside is clear sky and 40 degrees? When I brought up all these arguments to her she did not know what excuse to find and she said that she will not cover our expenses and she is the boss so I cannot talk with anybody else. So after showing a huge level of incompetency to your clients that paid for your tickets, you do not even try to make it up to them?

The day before our flight we were so excited to know that next morning we would be spending our Christmas Eve with my family. Unfortunately for us our plans changed quickly for the worst. At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasn’t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didn’t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if we’re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldn’t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right.

Our former flight before our connecting flight was also a disaster to say the least. Never have I ever landed at the destination only to wait an hour just to get off the plane. Why?

I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they can’t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure.

Spokane to Seattle and Seattle to San Jose and vice versa. Only 1 of those flights actually happened. I was notified and hour before my first flight that it had been cancelled and was only offered a flight leaving in the next 30 minutes or a flight leaving 6 hours later than planned. The flights did not go through Seattle either, they went through Salt Lake City. This wasn’t a huge deal. I got to San Jose a little earlier than planned, but not without the headache. On the way back to Spokane, my flight from San Jose to Seattle went accordingly. However on arrival to SeaTac airport, I was informed of a delay. I was also told that I would be leaving from gate D4. I went to D4 and the screen said Eugene Oregon. So, I updated my email and it said I was actually to leave from S16. I went to gate S16. There was nothing. I asked the concierge desk and they said flight from D4 had left. So I switched to the next flight to Spokane. Which was only a stand-by ticket. I figured since I had an hour, I’d check if D4 had actually left. It had not. They would not switch me back to my original flight from D4.

A very pleasant experience with Delta, check-in and bag drop at LAX was seamless, despite long lines for the security at terminal 2. However the boarding process was a bit hectic and it feels like Delta is trying to cram as many flights into the small terminal 2 at LAX. Flight services on the cross-continent flight are wonderful. Glad to see they've upgraded the personal entertainment system on the 767s into newer larger HD screens. It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had!

2017-11-03,5,10,"""business class old and outdated""",K Sheares,"✅ Verified Review |  Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience.",,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 767-400', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Business Class', 'Route': 'Munich to Tampa via Atlanta', 'Date Flown': 'October 2017', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Ground Service': 3, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 3, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.)

They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to.

I purchased his tickets from Killeen to Panama City (United) for August 31 and the return trip on Delta for September 4th. Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future.

Cabin configuration with a staggered 1-2-1, seat itself very old but sort of ok (narrow though). The worst of this flight is the inflight service, seems at Delta they don't take their premium customers seriously; food below par (entree cold, beef fillet hard as a stone); presentation so poor (when you put some warm bread on my tray, why on Earth should you put it on the butter so that it melts everywhere?). Cabin crew attitude too casual for a business class cabin. IFE in such a small screen that some smartphones are bigger; new business class blanket (by Westin) is oddly covered - on the supposedly external face in a very hard and ""plastic""-look-and-touch material which I fail to understand.

2017-08-20,8,10,"""interior cabins clean and modern""",D Collard,"✅ Verified Review | Victoria-Seattle-Atlanta-Washington (DCA), Delta Comfort+ class, outbound on 2 August 2017, returning 10 August, using points accumulated with KLM plus $400 in taxes and fees. In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T on the ATL-SEA return leg. The FA had no idea how the drink should be poured, even though I'd done my best to ask her to (i) give me a cup with a couple of ice cubes, then (ii) give me the little bottle of gin (they offered Bombay Sapphire), and then (iii) let me pour the tonic water as the last step. She kept giving me a combination of ice and tonic water first, for me to add the gin as the last step.

It was just a small amount they gave us back but we thought it's worth it to use it. But after what happened to us on august 2 we will never book with delta again. Our plane was scheduled for 7:02 pm (August 2nd) but then they kept delaying the flight for 3 hours and it kept getting more.

That was the time when we read that the flight got cancelled! We did not get informed by delta nothing! It was not even on the board. So we went to the gate agent to talk with them but the people we talked to didn't understand our situation at all.  We literally had to beg them to help us. My boyfriend called the number they gave us to at least get a coupon or anything that could help us out. But nothing. Even when I asked them for blankets they got mad. Just because we didn't want to accept that they are allowed to treat us like that just because the flight got canceled due bad weather conditions in New York.  Now was the time we gave up hope and decided to stay next to other people sleeping on the Floor waiting for our flight to depart at 11:10 am!

I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off.

I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination.

I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option.

My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them. We were then told that they had come on an earlier flight.

I was very disappointed with Delta Airlines, I booked my ticket to Zimbabwe on January 28th, 2017 for a trip in May 2017. I purchased separately a Delta Comfort seat for an additional total of $418 because I knew the 16 hour non stop flight to and from ATL to JNB was long. This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away. Now, I was told to take the economy seat as there were not delta comfort seats available as the plane was getting ready to takeoff. I had no choice but to do so. As a delta skymiles member, I was lied to by these agents and was very disrespected. If Skymiles members are treated this way and based on this experice, I will certainly cancelling my skymiles membership and delta gold credit card after being treated like trash.

We had a multi leg flight but were told we wouldn't be allowed our luggage for any of the flights even though there might be room on the last flight. The flights themselves were fine, friendly staff and relatively on time. Just minutes late nothing bad. The next night is when we land at Daytona, the last flight and one of our bags doesn't turn up. Luckily an agent was still on site and told us that unfortunately the bag didn't get on the flight at Denver and that instead of being sent to Atlanta they sent it to Minneapolis. The bag is ""hopefully"" going to be on the 11am flight tomorrow which we have to go and pick up ourselves!

My original departure for return started in Brunswick followed by a horrendous stop in Atlanta. Upon arrival at approx 230 pm I was directed to a boarding gate in terminal A gate 17. A short hour later they changed the gate to terminal A gate 31. A short hour later the flight was changed to terminal B gate 33. Keep in mind at no time was an announcement ever made for gate change, the unmanned tv screen just miraculously changed without notice. Just when we thought it was over and by we I mean the several passengers in wheelchairs, and those needing assistance to board, we're notified that 2 mins prior to boarding time they had changed gates again. This time we would have to run essentially to terminal E gate 35. Some arrived approx 10 mins after scheduled boarding including myself to be told that the flight will mow be pushed back because it flew in from Colombia and needed to be cleaned. I approached the gate representative and notified him that my next leg from Seattle was international and that the new arrival time only allows a 30 minute window between arrival time and actual departure of my next leg international to Victoria, Canada. The response I got was priceless and he typed my name into the computer to verify and suddenly looked up with a smile as he said I guess you should run when you get there! While I wanted to laugh I also realized it's probably not a good time as a rep to be making jokes to passengers who have been re-gated 4 times and may or may not make it home to their family on time or even the same day.

The captains of the plane struck up conversation before boarding and were very friendly. When we boarded the flight attendants asked our names, where we were from and treated us like gold. But, then we got to Minneapolis. We asked politely if there were any upgrades available and the gate agent answered the most condescending ""you do that when you book. Who told you that you could come here and ask me for this?!"" I was stunned. Not just stunned frankly insulted and angered. Paying customers should never be treated with such contempt and outright disgust. Delta who claims to put there customers first in this instance treated us like mere nuisances.

Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it. We were never offered any drink, and the service/attention we received was no different than in economy - which, in my opinion, was also sub-par. With the financial windfall airlines have enjoyed the last few years, I would expect more - and also cannot understand why they charge for 1 checked bag at all!

On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta.

It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline.

I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket. After 20 minutes thanks to Air France staff they gave my boarding pass. Once I arrived in Copenhagen my baggage did not appear. Then I asked for assistance at CPH lost baggage services to locate my baggage, and they informed me that they have no record after Atlanta. They asked me to contact Delta customer services agents. I contacted them and they were simply reading back to me what is on the Delta website and asked me to wait or either file a lost baggage complain.  As per the telephone conversation with Delta baggage services on Saturday, they said they will deliver the baggage to my United States address as they do not have information regarding my baggage. Saturday the 10th December around 10.30pm they rang me and informed me that my baggage arrived at CPH and they are going to deliver it to my hotel. However, I could not hand over those to him as baggage was delivered to me around 11.00pm Danish time Saturday the 10th December, after my brother left Copenhagen. He flew back to Sri Lanka on the 10th December. I was really stressed out as I had to carry the Christmas gifts back to the US and I have no other way to deliver the gifts before Christmas. Moreover, I have to carry that 16kg back to Denmark next time. I asked them for extra compensation as they ruined my holiday as well as I have to find another way of sending the stuff to my family which I already bought for them. I don't think anyone would spend the US $1200 just for 3 days travel if the trip is not really important. Due to their mistake, my holiday was ruined and I could not fulfil the purpose of my travel.

Cabin service impressed me. We received two meals, a snack, and at least three beverage rounds (drinks, coffee/tea, juice). Cabin crew were attentive and conscientious. We have flown British Airways and American Airlines internationally on this same route previously and were not impressed. Delta wins. I might add that the Detroit airport was great.

There were no first class meals at all and not enough coach meals to go around. Passengers were asked to share which was OK because the sandwich they provided to me was soggy - almost soaking wet and smelled so bad I refused to eat it in any event. Beverages were also in short supply and at the end of the flight as a first class passenger I was offered a choice of Diet Coke or tomato juice only. According to staff the plane should have been catered for the return flight in Atlanta and that did not get done. Flight crew advised that they had asked the terminal staff in Bonaire to make an announcement that if you wanted food or drink you needed to buy it before boarding. If that was done neither myself or anyone I talked to in first class heard the announcement. Flight crew promised that Delta would have a representative at the gate in Atlanta to do something for our inconvenience - that was a pipe dream. Due to the delays I had to run to clear customs, immigration and make my next flight out of Atlanta - also in the first class cabin but with no meal service. So I had a 12 hour travel day with a soggy, inedible sandwich and two bags of chips.

We were reassured at Heathrow that rebooking would be taken care of. There was no further information at any point other than vague and empty reassurances after which we had to wait in a queue for immigration control for one and half hours. By this time I had a migraine and felt very unwell from the stress of the entire situation. After another queue at re-booking queue of 30 minutes were we told that there were no further flights for the day and we were booked into the Holiday Inn South Hotel, and provided with food vouchers for an evening meal and breakfast. We lost a day of our holiday as a result. On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States. We then arrived at re-booking and had to wait a further 30 minutes to be told that we had been booked on the next flight which was leaving in 5 minutes and that we should run to the boarding gates. We pushed our way through the security ran all the way to the shuttle train, down corridors and up escalators and got to the gate to be told the flight had gone and there was nothing they could do. We were given a voucher to stay at the Ramada Plaza hotel. We did not have any hand luggage as this was checked on the flight but we were told we could collect an overnight pack. The queue for this appeared a further 30 minute wait so we headed off to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to queue for a further 30 minutes before being allocated a room for the night.

2016-12-20,1,10,"""the worst customer service""",Stephanie Bradley,"✅ Verified Review |  I was taking what was to be a simple flight from Phildelphia to Chicago with a quick stopover in Detroit. When I landed in Detroit (before 8am), I saw that the flight had been delayed by an hour. This was not a bad thing, given that my original flight would have been boarding by the time I landed and I needed to get from an A gate to a B gate. That flight landed, deplaned, some crew arrived and got on board, and we are waiting, and waiting. They told us we were waiting for a First Officer, they had no idea where he was but hadn't shown up. So while we waited, the crew for our flight timed out. So, they send us a few gates down, where we waited for a flight that was coming in from Minneapolis. This was delayed, then delayed some more, then mechanical issues, then for two hours they told us the plane had pulled away from the gate, but hadn't taken off yet. From what I can tell, the plane never did, and I am not convinced there even was a plane coming. So, at around 3 something, they move us yet again from a B gate, back over to an A gate. Here, the gate agent told me there was a 5:40 flight, but that this flight was scheduled to take off at 5:25, so I should stick with that. All things were looking good (9 hours later) to get this 5:25 flight out. Plane lands on time, plane deboards, some crew get on board, and we are all eagerly anticipating geting on and getting home. Then they start delaying us in 10 minute incriments. Now, while it seemed like some sort of sick joke, the announcement comes across that once again they cannot find a pilot or the first officer. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The horrible realization was creeping up that time was of the essence and I likely was not going to get home that day for no good reason. There was one final flight out that night at 8:30. I went to customer service, where she was anything of customer friendly, but I finally got one of the last two seats available on that flight. She told me I had been switched to the 5:40 flight and missed it, which I had never been told happened and had been given a boarding pass and seat assignment for the flight I was standing waiting on. She accusingly said, ""Well here you go Stephanie, if that's even your name"" as she handed me my boarding pass for the 8:30 flight. Not the slightest bit of an apology as I had been stuck there at this point for 11 hours at nobodys fault but Delta. My time is more valuable then a box of snacks and sack of food from Wendys that were tried to buy me off or passify me. I eat organic, gluten free foods, so that wasn't helping my missed work or hunger. Of course no vouchers were offered, as Delta doesn't offer that, nor was any comfort provided in the Sky Club as I was told that was a different branch. All in all we took off a bit after 9pm after being stuck in Detroit for 13 hours. Some may try to say this was a case of winter weather. That is a lie. This was poor planning, negligence, poor service, and a cheap airline that has no consideration for it's customers well being. I travel 60% of the time for work and for the most part am the decision maker on my travel.

I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard.  Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing.",yes,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'YYZ to PHL via DTW', 'Date Flown': 'November 2016', 'Seat Comfort': 4, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 3, 'Inflight Entertainment': 5, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 4, 'Value For Money': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy. What came as a very good surprise was the meal and beverage service. We had a choice of 3 different dinners (one being vegetarian) and they came with an entrée, salad, cheese and dessert. We had a mid-flight snack in a small box and a pre-arrival sandwich. We also had ice cream. Beverages were served often and each was given a bottle of water. Coffee was good and wine and beer was complimentary. I beleive this was of my best economy class flights ever, better than Air France for sure. On the outbound flight, I had seat 10c on the Detroit-Amsterdam in an A330. Great legroom and worth the money. The ticket cost me €460 return and that inlcudes Comfort class from DTW to Amsterdam @ €89 one way.

I went through TSA and into the terminal. The Delta terminal at LA would be an insult to 3rd world airports because there is absolutely nothing going on there. Unlike the competing American carrier's terminal where there is always music playing and all duty-free on one side, and all planes on the other so passengers can watch planes come and go, it kind of already made me hate the airline. The boarding was pretty efficient, and the cabin crew was the highlight of the experience. This was a red eye flight, and despite that the FA's kept making rounds of the cabin offering water, drinks, and snacks. In addition to that, they went out of their way to shuffle baggage in the cabin to make space without having to check them in.

The ground and inflight staff were competent, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, which is my usual experience with Delta personnel. I am not a foodie, but I was not impressed with the catering.

Eventually we were let out, and headed to the next plane. On the next plane we had to wait for 1:45min because it needed to be refueled, and the refueling people forgot to close the cap on the gas tank - so that took time to be resolved. I must say the crew did an excellent job dealing with all the issues. But I am very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. ATL is a major Delta hub, so how  they don't have an extra plane in case of an emergency?! Also the fact that we were kept 3.5 hours on termac was awful! It is inhuman to keep people on the plane while trying to fix it. The fumes that eventually leaked from flooded engine were suffocating us, all while we were told to hang on tight and wait until they figure out if the pump works. I know I do not spend time in my car while mechanic is working on it, so why the passengers had to stay on the plane while having mechanical issues. By far this was my worst experience flying, and I travel a lot. Overall I am greatly disappointed with how Delta handles its business when planes are facing mechanical issues.

There were no flights available but they could possibly get 3 of us out that day and the other person out the next day.

I was handed a Delta card with the 1-800 number and told me to call them. I indicated I already did. This was a huge ordeal as I felt Delta was of no help for something they created. Long story short, in order to fly out that day I had to purchase additional tickets with American Airlines. I went back to the Delta counter spoke and said I was able to get tickets with American and wanted to cancel the ones just booked. She said that was fine but that would also cancel our return flight. I indicated that was unfair as the flight going to was the only one affected, but was told this wasn't how it worked.

I try my best to be tolerant but it frustrates me that I am paying the same amount of money to have someone's body mass spill over and occupy a portion of my seat. It's uncomfortable for me and embarrassing for them. Either make them buy two regular seats or one first class seat. 2) I understand the temperature of the plane has a purpose, but when I am still too cold/uncomfortable when wearing two sweatshirts, a jacket, jeans and a blanket, you need to turn the heat up a little. 3) Stop overbooking your flights. People aren't paying to get bumped out of their seats. 4) My flight today was delayed 4 hours and I am missing one of the events that I specifically purchased this ticket for.

The staff were warm and friendly, but they too confessed these updates were difficult for them becuase they can no longer even see when passengers request assistance or have questions from their seats. The call lights are too low on the overhead space for attendants to see and there has been zero adjustment on leg space and comfort for passengers. In addition there was no inflight entertainment on a 5 hour flight. After this terrible experience, I have now been struggling to return home to Los Angeles from my work trip to Louisville, due to Delta's system crashing, their apparent logical response to the thousands of passengers stranded is to prolong and cancel even more flights putting the issue off.

No offers were made at all to make any passenger feel better about their service, just a rebooking. Today travel was going smoother, I had a two hour planned delay and I asked a Delta rep if they could put me on a near empty flight that had seating available and left an hour earlier. I didn't even have a checked bag. I was treated rudely by Delta staff and told it was a $50 up charge even though I had no baggage and I explained my previous poor experience. You would think they would want to help a little at no cost to them. The Delta staff didn't care and didn't even offer to attempt to ask anyone what could be done. I'm not a rude passenger, just hoping they would help me out to have a better experience this time. I own a small business and I think it's a shame when a company becomes so large that common sense and courtesy to customers cannot prevail. I would be appalled if my employee treated my customer this way. I will be interested to see if Delta cares enough to contact me, if not, there are other airlines I can use for my business travel for me, my employees and my family.

Flight information indicated an LA arrival of 10:20 pm, versus the originally booked ETA of 9:50 pm. No big deal. But, the way they staff handled boarding was so disorganized that we left much later than the (already delayed) ETD of 7:40 pm. It was like herding cats with many people being left with no overhead storage space. I was fortunate to have boarded with zone 2, but it was incredible how many carry bags and back packs that could easily fit under the seat in front of passengers wound up in the overhead. Thus, quite a long delay doing last second checking of bags. The pilot made up time and it was proudly announced we had landed in LA at 10:04 pm, roughly 10 minutes later than the original schedule. But, then we sat on the runway for two hours before finding a gate at the Tom Bradley International terminal. So, it appears our flight was sacrificed to avoid backing up other flights. We exited into the terminal (after midnight) to find (literally) wall-to-wall people waiting on flights. A serious mess. Then the long walk with our bags to get to a domestic terminal to pick-up our shuttle. When we were getting ready to exit the plane, the pilot came over the PA with a less than sincere, meaningless apology. This airline is horrible!

I was supposed to travel from Minneapolis to Paris but we were one hour late because they took of one hour late from Las Vegas. Not only that but when I arrived at the gate in Minneapolis they closed it 20 minutes prior to departure (the cut off time is 10 minutes) and forbade us to get on board. I'm pretty sure they ovebooked that flight and gave away our seats or sold them.

Then they told us very dryly to go to the help desk where actually nobody was actually help you. They just gave you a phone number and let you solve your own problem so I was forced to stay on the phone for over one hour to try to rebook my flight and repair their mistake. I had to spent one night in Minneapolis and the next day they flew us to Salt Lake City where I had to spend 8 hours in the airport; the flight to Europe was delayed again 3.5 hours so by the time I arrived in Europe I missed my connection again so they rebooked me on a flight to Paris from Amsterdam. That plane too left one hour later than scheduled and my final plane had another hour delay to my final destination to Bucharest.

Once that was complete, we went through TSA/airport security, where the problem arose. There were eight people on our booking, however two of the boarding passes had not printed correctly, with the barcodes only printing halfway. As such, the boarding pass was unable to be scanned, and we were told to print out new boarding passes. We ran back down to the ticketing counter, had our boarding passes reprinted by an actual employee of Delta Airlines (not at the kiosk), and went back to TSA, only to find that this new boarding pass would not scan either. Again, we had our boarding passes reprinted once more, and again, it would not scan. The TSA officer stated that the issue was that there was no “destination” stated on the new boarding passes. We then had to go back downstairs to the ticketing counter, retrieve our original boarding pass with the faulty barcode, and bring them all back up to TSA. Only then were we allowed to pass through airport security. We reached the gate 4 minutes late, and were not allowed to board, even though the cabin doors had not been closed. During this time, our friends who had successfully passed airport security had been explaining to Delta Airlines employees at the gate, however they received no help from them. The Delta employee at the gate stated that all he could do was put us on a waiting list on the next Delta Airlines flight, which was already full, and that we should contact other airlines for a new flight.

2016-07-11,2,10,"""4/4 flights were delayed""",O Carter,"✅ Verified Review | San Diego to Providence via Atlanta with Delta. We were traveling as a family to attend our son's graduation. We booked our trip in First Class as we consider coast to coast a long haul flight, and we like our comfort. Firstly, 4/4 flights were delayed. Delays due to weather, to not having a gate ready to disembark passengers, to long lines waiting to take off, to a faulty fuel cap, to missing paperwork, to delayed arrival of connecting aircraft, etc. Second, the seats in first class are hard as rocks, as well as cramped and narrow with insufficient recline. United gets the edge on this amenity, hands down. On the 4 aircraft we flew on, only two had entertainment systems. Only one of those two worked. On the other two aircraft, you may use your own device to access their new ""Delta Studio"", which offers ""free"" entertainment. However, the only entertainment value in Delta Studio is trying, and consistently failing, to get it to function. The icing on the cake of our tedious journey was on the final leg home. Our flight from Providence to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours, then rerouted off the Eastern Seaboard to a far western track south, causing more delay, bringing us in to Atlanta about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of our last leg home. At the arriving gate, someone told us that if we sprinted, we just might make our flight, which at that point was listed as on time. We actually managed to get to our departure gate at about 10:30, which was scheduled departure. The genesis of the problems we encountered from here on began when we optimistically assumed that the gate agent at our delayed arrival gate had notified the departing gate that their 3 missing passengers were on their way. Alas, he did not. Gate agent at departing gate tells us that he reassigned 1 of our 3 first class seats to someone else, since we ""failed"" to make our flight, and that the only option left was a standby seat left in the middle seat of economy. So, my husband's seat was reassigned during our sprint to the gate and he gets downgraded. We asked if we would receive compensation for the downgrade. We asked if at least my husband could expect premium service in his new seat assignment. We asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight. Staff replies with chapter/verse about ""procedures"".

The crew were nice and gave me extra snacks and drinks and apologized for the bad seat. The seats were rather uncomfortable, but they were tolerable for the flight time. Best part about the first leg was the IFE. Delta has free streaming from your device, so I was occupied during my entire flight. At JFK, we had a very short connection, of only 51 minutes, but the previous flight arrived 20 minutes early and the international flight left 20 minutes late, so we had plenty of time.

The 757-200 is very good to fly transatlantic routes, and it had a new interior with mood lighting, IFE, and extremely comfortable seats. The touchscreen were very fast and responsive, with plenty of movies and other options. Dinner and drinks came out right away, and the options, the classic chicken or pasta, of which I chose chicken, was very good. Plenty of food and drinks to keep me satisfied throughout the 7 hour flight. I slept for 4 hours, which is a lot for me, I usually don't sleep on planes, but the seats were extremely comfortable. All the seats had USB and AC power, so I kept all my devices charged and ready for taking pictures.

Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate.

It started with a delayed flight that would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did receive email notice, but the itinerary was not rebooked. I went to do it myself but was unsure whether or not I could make the earlier flight and so I decided to wait to resolve the issue at the airport customer service desk. Apparently that was my fatal mistake. I arrived at the airport a good hour before the earlier flight's scheduled departure and proceeded to stand in line for half an hour at the desk while 1 customer service rep was struggling to manage a growing line. By the time the other representatives who had been walking in and out of the back room finally jumped in to help, I had tried and failed to rebook myself both online and on the phone, where the estimated wait time was 34 minutes. The representative rebooked me on the remaining itinerary available which was several hours later. After security I then stood in another customer service line for nearly an hour to receive my seat assignment. This flight was also significantly delayed, and even after boarding, we then sat on the tarmac for another hour because of first ""congestion on the runway"" and then ""inclement weather"". I also was asked to check my carry on due to space limitations, and when I protested explaining that I had an interview the next morning and my suit was in my carry on and I didn't want to risk the luggage being lost, the representative literally pulled my ticket out of my shirt pocket to check my name. We were all frazzled, but this really took me aback. By an act of God, my new layover was several hours and the gate happened to be right next to our arrival gate so I made the connection despite the two hour delay (on top of the delay from my original booking). This second flight was also slightly delayed and again I was asked to check my carry on. This time I relented after the representative offered that I remove my garment bag and she would hang it in first class. This rep is the only reason I'm giving a rating above the absolute minimum.

Flight from PHL to DTW was on a Boeing 717-200 and delayed by 2 hours due to heavy thunderstorms in PHL and temporary airport closure during that time. Not Deltas fault and they seemed to do everything they could to rebook passengers with tight connections at DTW. Aircraft used was small and again packed full. Again basic service. DTW serves as Deltas second largest hub and is easy to get around since domestic and international Gates from Delta and partners are just across the hall. DTW-MUC again on an old B767-400ER, but with flawless service and nice selection of beers and wines even in Economy Basic. Also love the fact that the B767 has only two seats in the outer rows, which makes window seats even more attractive. Flight was only half full with plenty of room for sleeping. Flight time 8:20 hours with a landing 20 minutes earlier in Munich than scheduled. Based on the experience I will fly Delta to the US again, because DTW seems a good airport to enter US soil and connect to different cities.",yes,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 767-400 / MD88 / B717', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'MUC to CVG via ATL', 'Date Flown': 'June 2016', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 5, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 5, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

DL's (and other US carriers') continued use of this extremely uncomfortable relic on routes well over an hour long boggles the mind. The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps.

I do prefer Delta to other US airlines, however. Flew Detroit to Shanghai. The leather seats are pretty nice, as they feel less dirty than the fabric seats can potentially be. The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however.

This was the first time I have had such a bad experience flying. I was supposed to arrive home by Monday evening, but the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to mechanical failure so I would be missing my connection. I was rerouted to go home via a different airport, but that flight was also delayed by 2 hours due to weather.  After standing in line for 45 minutes and spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was rescheduled for a flight out the following morning. Delta at least covered the accommodation, but I had to contact my work last minute. I thought the saga had ended when I arrived back at the airport the next morning. I was in for a surprise. I called the central help line to see if I could get my bag checked for free, since I had purchased liquid souvenirs after passing security the day before. The agent on the phone said they would maybe reimburse me, but thankfully noticed that my flight out that morning was delayed by 2 hours. She made a very deft, last minute move to rebook me for an earlier flight out through a different city and I had to run through security to make that flight. Having reached my layover city en route home a day later than expected, I thought, ""I'm finally on my way."" However, Delta had the wrong flight information posted at the gates. I was not aware of the mixup until my name was called over the intercom for the final boarding call. I rushed to the correct gate and barely made it onto the aircraft on time. I was very very upset at this point. I had to conclude that since I had never experienced this type of delay-after-delay-after-mistakes before flying with other airlines, that it must be something to do with Delta. I would not fly Delta ever again.

We were brusquely told to just sit down and watch the screens. Our name would appear with the seating assignment. We sat and waited -  and waited. Not sure of what was happening. We waited until the clerk was finished boarding one group and didn't seem to be too busy. We again, politely asked how this system worked and were once again rudely told to sit down. Finally, when they were calling for last minute passengers we went to the desk again. This time we refused to sit down. Eventually they found us two seats, one at the back and the other in the middle of the plane. We were the last ones on.

On the way out, the flight was delayed on departure. No reason was given. On the way back, I ended up finishing early. I called Alaska to try to shift to an earlier flight. As expected, Alaska picked up in a couple of minutes. I attempted to utilize the Alaska Airlines same day ticketed change program to move to an earlier, direct flight back to San Diego, but the relationship with Delta made it so their system wouldn't process the change without cancelling my ticket and rebooking. They told me to call Delta. I called Delta, but was immediately put into the que. Rather than wait I opted to take the call back. It took them more than 30 minutes to call me back. Fail on customer service. When they did call me back, they first tried to charge me a $200 change fee on a government fare. This isn't allowed under their negotiated contract, but I had to argue with them to get them to realize this. If I hadn't known this, they would have tried to shove that down my throat. Then they told me that even without the fee, it was going to cost $200 + to change my ticket due to a difference in fare. Their excuse was that I didn't have a reservation when I had just given them a ticket number. At this point, the conversation ended due to a clear issue with them being able to do their job and me being unwilling to pay for something that would have been free had I booked my entire trip with Alaska airlines in the first place.

The next morning while still in the air the pilot got word that the airport had not opened as planned so we had to land 4 hours away in the Liberia airport in Costa Rica. This would be a stressful situation for anyone in a foreign country without international calling to contact people back home. But instead of leaving us in Liberia until the ash cleared (which would've been like two days later) Delta helped make the situation easier by paying the fare for us to ride an air-conditioned charter bus all the way to our intended airport in San Juan.

Most of us were rerouted the next morning at 6:00am first bound for Atlanta, and then returning north to our final destination. I can't tell you how many passengers were left without a place to go, (they told us the terminal would be closed overnight,) and when we asked for food vouchers and water, we were all told that ""Delta no longer provides these things for their customers when flights are cancelled."" Had they not told their usual lies, many of us could have helped ourselves before it was too late. With a whole lot of angry people demanding answers, I would have hated to be the one behind the counter. We all asked to speak to the supervisor - she was of no help whatsoever.

Just about made the connection. Overall not bad on the eastbound legs. Food outstanding out of ATL. Good service, a little stand off-ish, but generally good. Arrived LHR 40 mins early. No Line at fast track and bags already on carousel so overall a good experience. LHR-BHM wasn't quite so smooth. Food terrible & this is not an understatement. I had baked cod that was described as crispy, but in fact was chewy and slightly rancid, so I didn't eat it. As I usually find eating in a plane more of a diversion than anything else I was happy to pass on the food. My son chose basil tortellini but bizarrely came in a cream green curry sauce. Not sure what the were thinking when they came up with this menu. Not nearly as good as Eastboud USA origination. My wife had the oxtail that she said was really nice, so I guess my son and I just made poor choices. Service (apart from 1 FA) could only be described as frosty. Landed ATL 20 mins early. Security a breeze. Now the fun begins. I picked up a text from DL to inform me connection was delayed by 45 mins, no big deal here, but as it was last flight out on Xmas eve and seeing the lines for rebooking I was starting to get a bad feeling. Then the flight delayed another hour. The heart starts to pound a little more, then 15 mins before boarding and it gets cancelled. Was then given 2 options 9.55pm on Xmas day or 6.10, but couldn't accommodate all 3 of us so we would have to choose who was in which flight. Really! Delta sucks when it comes to these type of occurrences. Yes, the delay was weather related and was mostly out of their control, but to have no reasonable back up plan is poor. They had already cancelled one of the earlier ATL-BHM flights, so surely could have anticipated this a little better. In the end I managed to get a car from Avis and drive myself, so all was not lost. If I had taken Delta's option I'd no doubt be feeling a little like Tom Hanks in the 'traveller'!

The domestic first class seats were comfortable enough, and there was a charging port between the seats as well, however there was no inflight entertainment. We were offered snacks like peanuts, potato chips, and crackers out of a basket, and all drinks were free. However, because of the short length of the flight there was no meal service, and even some of the larger snacks like tapas were unavailable. The flight attendants were polite and nice, but they were not above and beyond, and didn't interact with the passengers more than they had to. As we were flying in the Delta One cabin international, we got free access to the Sky Club, however with so many people flying for the holidays, it was overly crowded, and a restaurant by our boarding gate was a much better option to spend our two hour layover. When the flight from Atlanta to Brussels finally boarded, we were promptly offered champagne or orange juice. There was a Westin pillow and comforter set, TUMI amenities kit with a pen, lip balm and lotion, eye mask, socks, tissues, mouthwash, and earplugs. After passengers were seated, attendants brought cashews and refilled our champagne. About an hour after take off dinner service included option of beef or cod. The inflight entertainment was rather limited with about 30 or so movies and a handful of television shows on seatback screens.

We finally boarded and then had to wait on the tarmac for an hour due to heavy air traffic. The Captain kept us up to date, but still we were an hour late. There was one FA in Business and three in Economy. They announced that the beverage service would begin shortly and that passengers in Business and Delta Comfort were entitled to complimentary drinks, which was one of the reasons I booked DC in addition to the additional legroom. The beverage service started and we were in the second row of the Comfort seats. Everyone around me ordered soda, coffee, water but no one order an alcoholic drink even though it was late afternoon. When the surly flight attendant got to me I asked for a double gin and tonic. Without smiling she asked if I wanted the whole can. I figured it would save her time so I said yes. She couldn't find tonic in her drawer, harrumphed and walked back to get one. Upon returning she asked if I wanted one cup or two. I told her one would be fine. As she opened the first of the two gin bottles she looked at me and said, ""I'll give you these two but that's all you're going to get."" (She wasn't kidding.) I was dumbfounded. I didn't have any intention of ordering more, but I didn't need her to ensure I knew I wouldn't be getting any more - regardless of the fact that I was in a seat entitled to ""complimentary drinks"" (no mention of a limit). She pushed her cart to the next row and moved on. Later in the flight I wanted some water and got up and went to the rear galley, where the three FA's were enjoying one of the cheese and cracker snack boxes. They were talking and I didn't want to interrupt, but waited until one of them noticed me standing in the doorway. After several minutes one of them did and asked, ""What can I get you?"" ""A bottle of water please."" Her terse reply, ""We don't have bottled water,"" to which I replied, ""Fine then. A cup of water please."" She turned around, tossed the cup on top of the bin of ice on the cart, sloshed some water in the cup and handed it to me, never asking if I wanted ice (the water was room temp). I returned to my seat, looked at my husband and said Delta sucks. I understand if FA's are miserable when dealing with nasty passengers, but when the passenger is being polite there is no need to be surly and curt.

Flight attendant takes the poor Delta service to a new low. First, she is ramming her food cart onto seats and passengers shoulders and proceeds with no remorse or even a simple excuse me. Just passed with a drinks cart, looks like she looks at faces, and chooses who she will ask if they need a drink or not. She clearly ignored me as I awaited to get a drink, and I must say, I have never felt disrespected this much. I had to politely ask another attendant if drinks were for purchase or complementary, just to calm my head. Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman. When I asked why the attendants seemed so disrespectful, a senior attendant mentioned something along the lines of staffing etc, which I personally, thought was an excuse, as the aircraft seemed to be less than half full.  If had a choice, I would never fly Delta again.

Delta ranks third for their First Class offering. Seat pitch is the tightest at 37”, the food options on flights under 900 miles is a snack basket. As a Sky Club member, in addition to Admirals Club membership, we used both. I feel Delta’s Clubs are minimalistic in comparison. The bars are small and the food offering are somewhat amateurish. Don’t get me wrong. Boarding was orderly and we did not have to wait due to Priority. The planes were clean, the seat cushion is comfortable. All our flights left on time and arrived on time. Breakfast served to SLC, a plate with a Bagel Breakfast Sandwich on it, a side dish with some fruit. The Quality and taste were fine, the meal just looked un substantial compared to my other proffered carriers. The flight attendant to SLC was pleasant, did his job quickly and sat and read for the remainder of the flight. The Flight to SAN had a very proactive flight crew, constantly in the aisle, refilling drinks and constantly passing the snack basket, with some decent offerings. The return flight to SLC offered again the snack basket and some wine. A somewhat cold, but very professional attendant served us on this leg. She performed her job very well. The last flight to Austin offered dinner. After my earlier in the week breakfast flight, I was not expecting much. I was surprised to be offered a perfectly cooked Fillet, with sides and a dinner roll. Desert sadly was a pre packed brownie (Really, Prepackaged in First). All in all Delta did its job, we were spot on time and our bags came out fairly quickly. The food offering are spares in compared to other, but what was offered was of decent quality.

Overall, the service is poor. We have found cabin staff mostly friendly and helpful, though not always. Food is usually ok but I am afraid that on numerous flights pre booked months in advance, my family are seated in different parts of the plane, most unacceptable particularly dissappointing when you have booked a family holiday months in advance. When challenging them about this we get nowhere. The last flight we checked in online and received a telephone call to say all was ok but when we were checking our luggage in on the return journey we were told at check in 'oh this flight goes tomorrow evening'! Now after much arguing and apologies we were put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt but 35 hours door to door from US to UK is totally unacceptable. This experience on numerous occasions has made us reconsider. The flight experience is far too much hassle for a family and I have to say I am relieved we do not have to endure this ever again.

Eventually got through, and was offered flight from ATL to Paris, with a connection to LHR. Had to point out to the operator this would take-off whilst we were en-route to ATL. Eventually got offered flight to Philadelphia, to connect to a London flight the next evening. Asked if there was a way to contact England to advise our taxi company not to pick us up until following day. They said they had no international calling arrangements. Got to ATL about 10:45 at night, then spent about an hour trying to arrange overnight hotel (three quarter full flight, and 4 customer service clerks). Eventually given voucher for hotel, and told to wait at the hotel shuttle pick up point outside. Hotel shuttle didn't turn up, and wasn't listed on list of hotel contacts to allow us to contact it. Eventually driver from another hotel took pity on the 14 of us booked to that hotel, and took us there. The hotel also had no way of making international calls. Next morning we found voucher was for accommodation only - we had to pay for breakfast! Flight to Philly was ok-ish (a MD88 is not as good as a 757). London-bound plane was a half-empty 757. However, although Premium Economy was almost empty we were still only allowed in Economy unless we were willing to pay for upgrade. The only time previously we have had a rearranged flight, also because of broken aircraft, was with BA who automatically upgraded us.

They were delivered to our home later that day on 2 separate deliveries, because one had arrived on a later Delta flight from JFK, the other had arrived on an earlier Virgin flight, also from JFK! So, in addition to us having an extra wasted day, Delta have caused us to be out of pocket for meals we wouldn't have had to pay for, and a taxi that went to LHR to meet us.

Anyway, the first leg when off without a hitch, seat comfortable, food fine entertainment good. The trip from Hawaii to Seattle was overnight, a little less comfortable (it was an economy seat) than the trans Atlantic and packed as an early flight had been cancelled some months earlier.

Flight home was bad: I arrived SFO at 11:45 am for 2pm flight. I received a message from Delta that flight was delayed and to contact them. I left the gate, through security, to check-in desk and they advised that the new departure of 2:38 was still good for my connection. Back to the gate, where before boarding an offer was announced to provide a $400 voucher for anyone who would stay behind, which I did not select because I had plans. We boarded at approx 2:30. Approx 2:45 the captain announced we would be held at the gate. We took off at approx 3:10 - at this point I knew I would need to rush to catch connection, which was from different terminal in LAX. We landed LAX ∧ were held on the tarmac, I deplaned at approx 4:48 to catch departing flight to Calgary Canada on WestJet (codeshare) at 5:05. I obtained assistance through security and ran to the gate in my socks to find the flight gone. I called Delta - they said the next flight would be the next morning. I went back to the other terminal and to the help desk - where we spent over an hour looking at every connection I could find (Vegas, Salt Lake, Vancouver) but every flight had a connection too close to make it home - so I gave in and arranged for the morning flight on WestJet. I asked for Delta to provide me with a Hotel - the answer was no. Supervisor gave me a discount voucher. Next I went downstairs to get my luggage. I was told it was with WestJet and I could not get it because WestJet personnel were not there, but not to worry it would be on my flight tomorrow. I got upset and the very helpful team actually went over got my luggage.  Now it is 8:30pm, 3.5 hours after my flight landed. I entered the website for the hotel, as per directions on the coupon. Site was blank for LAX. I called the phone number on the voucher and was told there was no availability for LAX! I called my husband - who went on the internet to search Airport hotels - everything was showing as FULL or over $350 for a 2 star. Thinking this was only because of how late it was, I called several of these hotels and was told they were indeed booked. I was offered expensive hotels miles away - no shuttle. I needed to be at the airport 2.5 hours before my 8am International flight (because I did not have a boarding pass with the change, I was told to arrive extra early for the flight). So this was unacceptable - I went back up to the Delta help desk to tell them to get me a hotel. I was again told by the supervisor they will not help with a hotel. Agent even left to confirm the voucher was not valid and hotels were indeed booked. I saw they had a flight posted leaving LAX at 9:45pm to Oakland (same are as SFO). I asked to be put on that flight but they would not do it - saying that was 2 legs and I only had 1 leg of my flight left. I had to pay $305 ($400 CAD) for 1 way to OAK, as flight was leaving and decision had to be made.

Then the cabin crew proceeded to serve six bottles of booze to the gentleman seated next to me, despite the fact that he was visibly intoxicated after the first four. Not sure how he'd assist with the emergency exit when he was drunk enough to begin making phone calls as soon as we could see the destination in the distance and yelling obscenities into his phone. Cabin crew ignored this just as they ignored the fact that they over served him beyond any reasonable margin of error. They'd sell him six bottles of tequila, but they only came through the cabin to provide half glasses of ice with a splash of soft drink on a three hour flight.

Apparently the Delta Air Lines flight out of Florence was cancelled to due wind. Delta (and their partner KLM) had my flight bussed to the Pisa airport, (with no explanation, the pilot on the next flight explained). There we were told that we'd be dropped off at our plane that was ""waiting"" and no worries about our connecting flights in Amsterdam. There was no plane waiting in Pisa. We were dropped off with no direction in the Pisa airport parking lot, we had to go back through security and stand in lines trying to figure out which flight we were suppose to take. By the time we made it to Amsterdam the connecting flights were long gone. The KLM/Delta service people, were rude and unhelpful. They would tell us to get in a specific line, where'd we'd wait for over an hour, then they tell us to go to a different part of the airport and get in a different line. The connecting flights that were missed for some reason could not be rebooked at the airport and we were told we had to call Delta ourselves and reschedule. To which, after two attempts at 1.5 hours each spent on hold I was finally able to rebook my flight at an international calling rate of $2 an hour, so I spent over $400 just to rebook the flight. That doesn't include the rest of the costs I incurred at my two days at the airport. And of course they lost my luggage. And of course they don't care. I just keep getting transferred over to different ""customer service lines"" where I have to wait on hold and then repeat everything.

Until my flight from LAX to SLC was rerouted to Grand Junction where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours. I know they cannot help weather, which is not what upsets me. It is that once I finally landed in SLC my next flight to Billings had just taken off.  Again, I know not something they can help. At this point everything for the next 24 hours was booked, there wasn't even a hotel they could get me in for the night. Again, not something that they can control.  So I rented a car and drove through the night on my own accord and expense. The complaint is that when I went to get the ticket refunded I called customer service before even leaving the airport while the flight to Billings was in the air and they insisted that I needed to wait until I completed my flight back to Honolulu before anything could be done. So 2 weeks later, I get back and make a call. Somehow it says that I flew the flight. Every person I called said that they couldn't do anything and gave me another number to call or sent me to the airport. It took me another 2 weeks of calling everyday to find someone who had any idea and knowledge on what to do. I have people telling me to go to the airport and others saying there was no need to go to the airport and they were sorry I was sent there. Well the person who knew what they were talking about, sent me back to the airport and told me who to talk to. I had to get a letter from the airport stating that I didn't fly on that flight. Now, almost a month after getting that paper and 2 months after not getting on that flight, I finally get an email saying it is up for review, but I need a letter from my bank stating that it is okay to give a cash refund.

Being that I live in Hawaii, I am 6 hours behind their time, I have had to get up early on my days off just to make sure that I can get through to speak with anyone.

Once boarded another announcement, some passengers did not board (they were the smart ones), so their bags have to be removed. One hour later, another announcement, as anticipated, crew is about to time out, solution is that we fly to MKE and change crew there (assured that there will be fresh crew in MKE - right). But then there is too much fuel on the plane, as it was meant to be a transatlantic flight. So have to remove some fuel in order to fly to MKE.

So around 9:00pm, rumors start circulating amongst the crew and those standing at the open door and gangway that the flight might be cancelled. At this point, that almost sounds like a blessing. By the time the announcement is made at 9:30pm that the flight is being cancelled, many of those in the know have already left the plane. So a mad rush to get off the plane and get rebooked and situated for the night. At time of rebooking they assure us that the same flight will be OK to go the next day at noon. Put you up at a hotel and here is a $15 meal voucher. Since its 10:00pm already, not a lot open at the airport to get a meal at. But weary and blurry-eyed, we are thankful for anything. Next day, refreshed for a night’s sleep and hopeful to finally get out of SEA, arrive at the airport again, go through the same drill, get through security, great, flight is still on time, go get coffee and walk to gate. Fellow passenger stops me mid-way to gate and tells me don’t bother, the flight has been cancelled again! Go to customer service and try to get rebooked.  Get to customer service and line is a mile long and not moving. Opt to jump on the phone and try to get a flight. Lady on the phone rebooks me on a flight SEA-MSP-AMS-SVO. That’s one more leg than I’d like but heck, get me out of SEA! It is now 11:26am, the flight to MSP is scheduled to depart at 11:30am from a gate that I have to take an airport train to get to. Booking agent assures me that the departure time is actually 11:50am so I have time. Finally get rebooked, rush to gate. Get there at 11:32am. Gate has closed!  Gate agent firmly states that flight was scheduled for 11:30, I am late and doors are closed. At this point, I am near tears. How do I get out of this airport?? My one piece of luck, the gate agent actually relents and reopens gate to let me on.",,"{'Aircraft': 'A330', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'SEA to SVO via CDG', 'Date Flown': 'August 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 2, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Food & Beverages': 2, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Value For Money': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Departure from Orlando was delayed due to airport closure for lightning, the aircraft was an old Boeing 757-200 and age was clearly showing.

Detroit to Amsterdam flight was a newly refitted Boeing 767-400 with nice business class beds but the monitor screen was small and could not compare with competing airlines. I selected the vegetarian option on the food which was a cannelloni with goat cheese on a bed of spinach, a very bland and uncooked dish, the bottom half of the pasta was dry and hard  there was a sprinkle of marinara sauce - not even enough to taste let alone to moisturize the pasta.

The seats are narrow, but so are many other airlines. What I liked was the configuration with single seats in a zigzag pattern on either side of the plane giving privacy to single travelers. Not much storage space, though. It's the tunnel like part of the pod where one's legs go in when the seat is in full flat position. The space is so confined that it's impossible to keep the feet straight up, forcing a person to lie on one's back only, unable to bend knees, requiring a contortionist skills to attempt sleeping on the side. The feeling is actually of being forced into a very narrow coffin. I honestly could never imagine being so uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a plane. I wonder if anyone at Delta actually tested the seats before installing them, certainly would fire those responsible for the decision!

The plane was freezing cold to the point where both me and my husband were physically shivering and it meant we could not sleep on the 9 hour journey at all. We alerted staff of our discomfort several times but they ignored us and the temperature stayed the same. On the shorter flights (3 hours Seattle to Minneappolis) there are entertainment systems but you have to pay $2 for headsets to use them. We tried to purchase a snackbox on board, but they wouldn't accept cash and would only accept card, which would have meant our bank charging us fees. Despite having only one hour changeover to check in for our next flight and go through security at Seattle, we got on the flight, but the airline managed to fail to send our bags, meaning we got them 26 hours after we should on arriving home.

2015-08-18,1,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Aly Schilperoort,"My family and I were getting ready to fly to Hawaii on a family vacation. Due to mileage reasons, we had to fly Delta though we usually fly Alaska. When we arrived at the airport and checked in at the Delta front desk to check our bags, they're seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding our 3 hour layover in San Jose. However, the lady at the desk assured us that everything was cleared up and our bags would make it on the plane with us. After a 3 hour flight delay and having to get off the plane because a flight attendant got injured, we finally took off, barely making our connecting flight in San Jose (we landed at 6.10, got off at 6.20 and our flight was taking off at 6.35). We had to sprint to our connecting flight. After arriving in Hawaii, our bags never arrived at baggage claim. We weren't too concerned at first, thinking that the bags probably just didn't make our connecting flight in San Jose but would be sent over shortly after. After waiting for the next flight arriving from Seattle to see if our bags came on that flight, they never did. Long story short, we ended up never getting our bags until 4 days after arriving in Hawaii.

Checked-in at the dedicated first class area, staff were polite and helpful. Departure from LAX was delayed one hour. On board the seat was filthy, seat pocket full of dirty napkins and plastic from the previous flight. The fast turn around in LA obviously did not include a cleaning of the cabin. Cabin crew seemed very inexperienced. Only one flight attendant serving first. Took meal and drink order one at a time, then went back and very slowly prepared it. I cannot say she was rude, but she was not pleasant either. Just robotic in her job. No offer of second drinks, or any ongoing service for the rest of the flight. She just stood in the galley, playing with her phone. When we were close to descent for Vancouver, I asked her if we were going to receive any arrival documentation for customs. She replied, ""oh yeah, I forgot about that!"" She and her coworker than proceeded to distribute the forms as we began our descent. Arrived in Vancouver about 45 minutes late.

2015-08-15,2,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Judika Chaba,"First we flew LAX to Savannah via Atlanta. The plane was late every step of the way. My twin 9 year olds and I were going for a small vacation, then to pick up a dog in Valdosta, GA and back home to LA. The LAX personnel with only one exceptional woman were surly and unhelpful. Because I was picking up a dog on the way back, I couldn't pick up my boarding pass electronically. The lines for help were long and the electronic rejection gave no answer. I tried to get help from 3 different Delta personnel, these were women who were recounting their evenings the night before and had no desire and felt no need to interrupt their gossip with work. Finally I found a friendly face among in the Delta line-up and this woman helped. The air crew was surly. Didn't think it was their job to help put up a bag. Turned up her little nose when my son asked for a drink. Atlanta to Savannah they held us on the tarmac 2 hours. Horrible. The way back was even worse. They were nice enough in Valdosta - which is so tiny they sort of have to be - nevertheless they body-searched an 80 year old woman in security. As usual the plane was delayed at Atlanta. Here there was no help available once you got there. Surly personnel. As a Amex Platinum card carrier, I was told I had the right to use the Delta Lounge. Since I was carrying a puppy and had my boys, we went to the lounge. The rude pretentiousness was shocking, and they refused to let us in the lounge. I called Amex and filed a protest and they called - but at that point I'd seen the pitiful offerings and decided to take the kids to PF Changs. The flight to LA was delayed 1.5 hours. When I got to the gate, I asked the girl at the desk what time the plane would actually board. The rude young women snapped at m: ""I just said that it would be in 1/2 an hour..."" I answered her: Obviously I just got here and didn't hear you or I wouldn't ask. Really, Delta? This is who you consider an appropriate employee? That's professional? Other passengers were complaining about her and about her male cohort. To board the plane it was complete chaos. Like being in a Third World country with a free-for-all at boarding - starting from the front rather than the back - so there is the inevitable bottleneck, and no clear instructions anyway. Again the flight crew think they're above helping with a bag. They're too busy to bring a meal mid-flight - for a child! Surliness, snootiness. Bad attitude. I thought United was bad. Delta is the worst. If I can avoid it, I'm not going back.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Savannah to Los Angeles via ATL', 'Date Flown': 'August 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 2, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 2, 'Ground Service': 1, 'Wifi & Connectivity': 1, 'Value For Money': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I go to Japan a lot and I'm used to stellar Japanese service, so I never had high hopes for service, but cabin crew were a little rude at times. I left a drink for them to collect and they were saying something like ""It seems like a waste"" and then took the drink. Not that I could finish it because it was right before landing. Very cold plane in my view. Seats were okay and IFE was okay. Dinner was regular but breakfast was terrible. The egg and sausage looked and tasted worse than a fast food restaurant. I could not get a return flight for a good price, and I don't know about other airlines, but when I changed my flight for a second time due to illness, they charged you 4k or more just for economy. No upgrades or anything. I ended up switching to another airline to get home. Again I was not too happy with Delta, but I wasn't expecting Japan-level service.

I was in premium economy and when you recline the seat back, the seat itself also moves forward. This initially seemed like a nice reclined position.

Between the big three American airlines (United, AA, and Delta), Delta would be my favorite. On all the flights they were organized, fast and on-time. From Chicago to Detroit, which was flown on a crj900, lasted only an hour but they still handed out snacks and drinks. On that flight my family and I were put in Comfort+ for no extra charge. Comfort+ had very nice legroom and very good seat width. The long haul flight from Detroit to Amsterdam was flown with a 767-400, which is in my opinion the nicest plane that Delta flies. With a 2-3-2 layout and me traveling in a party of 3 made it so we traveled in the middle section and were still undisturbed by an extra person next to us. It made the entire flight feel a whole lot more private. The IFE systems were great and had plenty of movies to watch. Were left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This made it super easy to catch my connection. At Amsterdam we had plenty of time to relax and explore the airport.

Well it did, but it was in the domestic flight section, separated by a rope and we weren't allowed to duck under to get coffee so had to go all the way back to the far end of the terminal to get a coffee from Starbucks. That done, we went to find Duty/Tax free shop. When we asked a member of staff where the Duty free shop was, she smirked at us and said there wasn't one.

2015-07-21,8,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Yann Pleindoux,"Got delayed from PAP, missed the connection and rerouted via MIA then ATL back to AMS. Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again.

2015-07-21,3,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Richard Winger,"This is not an acceptable C class. The seats feel short, the pitch is tight and you really can't recline much if you want to somewhat respectful of the person behind you. Service is basic, no cocktails, no nuts, a plate of just about edible dinner with a glass of undrinkable wine right after take off. Engine noise is deafening.

2015-07-21,3,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Rosemary Westgarth,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with. We chose Delta and the route because it had the best connections but next time we'll avoid Delta long haul.",,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Business Class', 'Route': 'Nashville to London', 'Date Flown': 'July 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 1, 'Cabin Staff Service': 1, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Long story short our plane was scheduled for a routine engine change on account of reaching so many miles. No one in the tower or the boarding team was aware of this. No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't.

2015-07-14,8,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,A Wilson,"BOS-CDG, overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy.

Waited on the taxiway for 20 minutes prior to takeoff, allegedly due to a stoppage at Laguardia, the connecting city. One bathroom on the plane, which was dirty. Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay.  We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members.

I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes.

Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly.

It was nice to check bags with no fees! Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class. The wrap and accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Drinks flowed and attendants were offered snacks and checked on customer needs.

This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

I selected the economy comfort seats and found them to be very nice and the legroom more than I expected. What was interesting how the cabin was separated though not with a divider so it felt very exclusive. In addition, there was a blanket and headset for watching the back seat TV. We received other snacks as well as the other normal offerings. One thing that can be said is Delta is trying to improve its service and the fact that they still offer some type of snack with your drink is better than what you get from American and United.",yes,"{'Aircraft': 'Boeing 767-300', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'Atlanta to Auckland via Los Angeles', 'Date Flown': 'June 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 4, 'Inflight Entertainment': 4, 'Ground Service': 4, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-02,1,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Liz Oquendo,"The flight was delayed. The boarding process was unorganized and a complete mess. We were the last ones to board and by the time we got to the entrance, my bag was automatically taken to be sent with the rest of the cargo because the flight was full and there was no space. When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag. The crew were also unprofessional and tried to argue the fact that once the bag is checked that there was nothing for them to do and that's how things are.

2015-07-02,9,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Colin Adams,"I often read negative reviews of Delta. I for one have found them to be by far the best of the legacy carriers. I always find the staff helpful and pleasant, both ground and cabin staff. My recent flight had a routing DSM/MSP/JFK/LHR. On arrival at MSP I realized that my connecting flight to JFK was delayed, making the JFK connection impossible. When I explained my dilemma to a very helpful Delta employee in the Delta Club room she immediately worked on getting both me and my luggage onto the MSP/LHR service. An ontime boarding took place and I was greeted with a smile by the cabin services manager. Once airborne dinner was served (a very reasonable meal) promptly allowing the maximum time for sleep. We arrived into LHR on time and I cleared immigration and customs in a little over 30 minutes from touchdown. Delta had done for me exactly what I had asked from them, a safe, pleasant, on time journey. All the staff that I encountered during this trip were friendly and responded positively to my needs.

Economy comfort seat was great with the extra legroom, would not have wanted to be in a regular economy seat for the 4 hour flight. Took off on time, good games, movies, TV shows on the large seatback screens. Flight crew stayed busy the whole time serving snacks and drinks with 2 or 3 runs at least.

No where when I purchased the ticket did it tell me I'd be charged at the airport, wouldn't you think they would have charged me upfront when I paid for the ticket? If that wasn't bad enough I was told that because of the short period if time before the aircraft was due to depart, 1 hr, if he didn't make the flight there would be an additional $50 fee to get him on the next flight. We were at the airport at 3.30am, not my fault that Delta's counters don't open until 4am.

2015-06-29,1,10,Delta Air Lines customer review,Heather Warr,"We started out in Boston. Our flight was delayed an hour which was no ones fault. It was because of weather. However after we boarded the plane the isles was full of passengers with carry on's and no room in overhead bins. Flight Attendant created confusion trying to rush us in our seats. They took all 4 of my family's bags and rudely told us they would arrive in SLC our final destination. A diff Attendant handed me 2 baggage labels. I started to ask why 2 instead of 4 and ignored me and rushed up the isle. Because of delay we missed our connection. The Delta staff at JFK were horrible! Very short and acted annoyed that they had to give us directions to catch the new later connection. We arrived at the new gate to more Very rude Delta staff. Our tickets said not assigned so I stood in line at the gate to find out our new seats. When I approached the Delta staff I was told to sit down she was working on assigning seats (several passengers missed the connection). I tried to request that seats together because we were traveling with children on a 5 hour flight. She firmly told me to sit down. I felt like an idiot. They put us on the very back row with seats that partially reclined. Let's just say it was a long 5hours. After arriving in SLC 3hours later at midnight, only 3 out of the 4 bags that the rushing flight attendant took from us in the aisle arrived. Went to bag help and another employee who said he could only take a report because they didn't have record that they checked 4 bags only 2 -  Delta did give us a 1888 number to call.

On the way back Delta had no record of our reservation but since we had proof they managed to squeeze us onto the plane after trying to get us to take one 2 hours later.

After being on the phone with several agents and talking to associates at the airport we were advised to find our own hotel and submit it to Delta for possible reimbursement. The next day I spoke to a supervisor and she informed me that Delta airlines does not issue reimbursements and she could only give it in a form of a travel voucher for our next flight.
