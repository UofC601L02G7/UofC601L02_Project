2016-05-19,8,10,"""big thank you to staff""",Donald R Simpson,"A big thank you to staff of Skywest Airlines at St. George Airport and on flight DL7393 Wednesday, May 18, 2016. My age related reduced mobility and endurance makes travel more difficult than in past years and I had dreaded this flight. However, Skywest staff made it one of the easiest flights I have had in years of travel. The male attendant in the boarding lounge saw my cane and luggage and without my asking came to me and asked if I would like help which I accepted gratefully. On boarding the female flight attendant also immediately took my luggage and placed it for me. On deplaning a male staff member offered to handle my luggage and proceeded to get me through the arrival lounge and to a wheel chair where I was taken all the way to the outside taxi stand. Given that the Skywest lounge at SLC airport is far removed from the baggage claim and taxi stand, this was more than just a convenience. I was able to arrive home without being exhausted. Kudos to the above mentioned Skywest staff - a team of champions.",yes,"{'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'SGU to SLC', 'Date Flown': 'May 2016', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Ground Service': 5, 'Value For Money': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-20,10,10,SkyWest Airlines customer review,Jerry Krinsky,The plane was a CRJ operated by Skywest. I was warmly greeted at the door by a very nice FA. Service was excellent. The seating on the CRJ is 2-2 rather than 3-3 on the larger planes. The plane was very comfortable and quiet. No entertainment system due to the short flight.,yes,"{'Aircraft': 'CRJ 700', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Route': 'SFO to SLC', 'Date Flown': 'July 2015', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 5, 'Ground Service': 5, 'Value For Money': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-04-23,3,10,SkyWest Airlines customer review,L Eriksson,I am a regular flyer but only had my first experience with SkyWest last week on a flight from Milwaukee to LaGuardia. Unfortunately I have to say it was the worst experience I have had with an airline. I booked the flight via Delta who did not include baggage in the ticket price and would not allow me to pay for this immediately - I had to wait until it was time to check in. Very inconvenient. They then proceeded to rescheduled the time of the flight about four times. As a result I had to call them to reschedule to a later flight which resulted in my missing several hours of my NYC vacation. The later flight took off as scheduled but was very old and had the smallest seats I have ever seen and I am a small person. Safety is clearly not a priority for this airline as the flight attendants did not explain what to do in case of an emergency and by checking the safety card I discovered there were no life vests or life rafts on board. In the event of us landing on water we were to use the seat cushions to stay afloat! Considering this flight crossed Lake Michigan and Lake Erie and flew over the Atlantic before landing at LaGuardia I find it baffling that they would even consider not having life vests on board.,,"{'Seat Type': 'Economy Class', 'Seat Comfort': 0, 'Cabin Staff Service': 0, 'Food & Beverages': 0, 'Inflight Entertainment': 0, 'Value For Money': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-01-05,7,10,SkyWest Airlines customer review,A Bastien,LAX to SMF on 12-10-14. Small regional jet economy but in an exit row with more than adequate legroom.

2015-01-05,8,10,SkyWest Airlines customer review,A Bastien,SMF to SLC - premium economy on Delta's regional carrier Skywest. In my experience seats on Skywest are more comfortable than the ones on Delta's larger aircraft. However the recline is minimal. Pleasant flight on time flight no food for purchase.,yes,"{'Seat Type': 'Premium Economy', 'Seat Comfort': 3, 'Cabin Staff Service': 3, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-01-05,7,10,SkyWest Airlines customer review,A Bastien,SLC to OKC. My spouse gave me her first class (upgrade) boarding pass. I can't comment on value for money because this was a free ticket. However first class was disappointing no food served or available for purchase on a flight that boarded at 1:20pm. (we had a one-hour layover). The seats were wider than those in EC and with more legroom. I'd fly Skywest again but would not pay for a first class ticket. Other than the lack of food the flight was pleasant the FAs attentive and courteous.,yes,"{'Seat Type': 'First Class', 'Seat Comfort': 5, 'Cabin Staff Service': 4, 'Food & Beverages': 1, 'Inflight Entertainment': 1, 'Value For Money': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
